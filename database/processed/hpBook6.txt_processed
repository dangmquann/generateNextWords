it wa nearing midnight and the prime minister wa sitting alone in his office reading a long memo that wa slipping through his brain without leaving the slightest trace of meaning behind he wa waiting for a call from the president of a far distant country and between wondering when the wretched man would telephone and trying to suppress unpleasant memory of what had been a very long tiring and difficult week there wa not much space in his head for anything else the more he attempted to focus on the print on the page before him the more clearly the prime minister could see the gloating face of one of his political opponent this particular opponent had appeared on the news that very day not only to enumerate all the terrible thing that had happened in the last week a though anyone needed reminding but also to explain why each and every one of them wa the government fault the prime minister pulse quickened at the very thought of these accusation for they were neither fair nor true how on earth wa his government page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling supposed to have stopped that bridge collapsing it wa outrageous for anybody to suggest that they were not spending enough on bridge the bridge wa fewer than ten year old and the best expert were at a loss to explain why it had snapped cleanly in two sending a dozen car into the watery depth of the river below and how dare anyone suggest that it wa lack of policeman that had resulted in those two very nasty and wellpublicized murder or that the government should have somehow foreseen the freak hurricane in the west country that had caused so much damage to both people and property and wa it his fault that one of his junior minister herbert chorley had chosen this week to act so peculiarly that he wa now going to be spending a lot more time with his family a grim mood ha gripped the country the opponent had concluded barely concealing his own broad grin and unfortunately this wa perfectly true the prime minister felt it himself people really did seem more miserable than usual even the weather wa dismal all this chilly mist in the middle of july it wa not right it wa not normal he turned over the second page of the memo saw how much longer it went on and gave it up a a bad job stretching his arm above his head he looked around his office mournfully it wa a handsome room with a fine marble fireplace facing the long sash window firmly closed against the unseasonable chill with a slight shiver the prime minister got up and moved over to the window looking out at the thin mist that wa pressing itself against the glass it wa then a he stood with his back to the room that he heard a soft cough behind him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he froze nose to nose with his own scaredlooking reflection in the dark glass he knew that cough he had heard it before he turned very slowly to face the empty room hello he said trying to sound braver than he felt for a brief moment he allowed himself the impossible hope that nobody would answer him however a voice responded at once a crisp decisive voice that sounded a though it were reading a prepared statement it wa coming a the prime minister had known at the first cough from the froglike little man wearing a long silver wig who wa depicted in a small dirty oil painting in the far corner of the room to the prime minister of muggles urgent we meet kindly respond immediately sincerely fudge the man in the painting looked inquiringly at the prime minister er said the prime minister listen it not a very good time for me i am waiting for a telephone call you see from the president of that can be rearranged said the portrait at once the prime minister heart sank he had been afraid of that but i really wa rather hoping to speak we shall arrange for the president to forget to call he will telephone tomorrow night instead said the little man kindly respond immediately to mr fudge i oh very well said the prime minister weakly yes ill see fudge page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he hurried back to his desk straightening his tie a he went he had barely resumed his seat and arranged his face into what he hoped wa a relaxed and unfazed expression when bright green flame burst into life in the empty grate beneath his marble mantelpiece he watched trying not to betray a flicker of surprise or alarm a a portly man appeared within the flame spinning a fast a a top second later he had climbed out onto a rather fine antique rug brushing ash from the sleeve of his long pinstriped cloak a limegreen bowler hat in his hand ah prime minister said cornelius fudge striding forward with his hand outstretched good to see you again the prime minister could not honestly return this compliment so said nothing at all he wa not remotely pleased to see fudge whose occasional appearance apart from being downright alarming in themselves generally meant that he wa about to hear some very bad news furthermore fudge wa looking distinctly careworn he wa thinner balder and grayer and his face had a crumpled look the prime minister had seen that kind of look in politician before and it never boded well how can i help you he said shaking fudge hand very briefly and gesturing toward the hardest of the chair in front of the desk difficult to know where to begin muttered fudge pulling up the chair sitting down and placing his green bowler upon his knee what a week what a week had a bad one too have you asked the prime minister stiffly hoping to convey by this that he had page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling quite enough on his plate already without any extra helping from fudge yes of course said fudge rubbing his eye wearily and looking morosely at the prime minister i have been having the same week you have prime minister the brockdale bridge the bone and vance murder not to mention the ruckus in the west country you er your i mean to say some of your people were were involved in those those thing were they fudge fixed the prime minister with a rather stern look of course they were he said surely you have realized what is going on i hesitated the prime minister it wa precisely this sort of behavior that made him dislike fudge visit so much he wa after all the prime minister and did not appreciate being made to feel like an ignorant schoolboy but of course it had been like this from his very first meeting with fudge on his very first evening a prime minister he remembered it a though it were yesterday and knew it would haunt him until his dying day he had been standing alone in this very office savoring the triumph that wa his after so many year of dreaming and scheming when he had heard a cough behind him just like tonight and turned to find that ugly little portrait talking to him announcing that the minister of magic wa about to arrive and introduce himself naturally he had thought that the long campaign and the strain of the election had caused him to go mad he had been utterly terrified to find a portrait talking page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling to him though this had been nothing to how he felt when a selfproclaimed wizard had bounced out of the fireplace and shaken his hand he had remained speechless throughout fudge kindly explanation that there were witch and wizard still living in secret all over the world and his reassurance that he wa not to bother his head about them a the ministry of magic took responsibility for the whole wizarding community and prevented the nonmagical population from getting wind of them it wa said fudge a difficult job that encompassed everything from regulation on responsible use of broomstick to keeping the dragon population under control the prime minister remembered clutching the desk for support at this point fudge had then patted the shoulder of the stilldumbstruck prime minister in a fatherly sort of way not to worry he had said it oddson you will never see me again ill only bother you if there is something really serious going on our end something that is likely to affect the muggles the nonmagical population i should say otherwise it live and let live and i must say you are taking it a lot better than your predecessor he tried to throw me out the window thought i wa a hoax planned by the opposition at this the prime minister had found his voice at last you are you are not a hoax then it had been his last desperate hope no said fudge gently no i am afraid i am not look and he had turned the prime minister teacup into a gerbil page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but said the prime minister breathlessly watching his teacup chewing on the corner of his next speech but why why ha nobody told me the minister of magic only reveals him or herself to the muggle prime minister of the day said fudge poking his wand back inside his jacket we find it the best way to maintain secrecy but then bleated the prime minister why ha not a former prime minister warned me at this fudge had actually laughed my dear prime minister are you ever going to tell anybody still chortling fudge had thrown some powder into the fireplace stepped into the emerald flame and vanished with a whooshing sound the prime minister had stood there quite motionless and realized that he would never a long a he lived dare mention this encounter to a living soul for who in the wide world would believe him the shock had taken a little while to wear off for a time he had tried to convince himself that fudge had indeed been a hallucination brought on by lack of sleep during his grueling election campaign in a vain attempt to rid himself of all reminder of this uncomfortable encounter he had given the gerbil to his delighted niece and instructed his private secretary to take down the portrait of the ugly little man who had announced fudge arrival to the prime minister dismay however the portrait had proved impossible to remove when several carpenter a builder or two an art historian and the chancellor of the exchequer had all tried unsuccessfully to prise it from the wall the prime page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling minister had abandoned the attempt and simply resolved to hope that the thing remained motionless and silent for the rest of his term in office occasionally he could have sworn he saw out of the corner of his eye the occupant of the painting yawning or else scratching his nose even once or twice simply walking out of his frame and leaving nothing but a stretch of muddybrown canvas behind however he had trained himself not to look at the picture very much and always to tell himself firmly that his eye were playing trick on him when anything like this happened then three year ago on a night very like tonight the prime minister had been alone in his office when the portrait had once again announced the imminent arrival of fudge who had burst out of the fireplace sopping wet and in a state of considerable panic before the prime minister could ask why he wa dripping all over the axminster fudge had started ranting about a prison the prime minister had never heard of a man named serious black something that sounded like hogwarts and a boy called harry potter none of which made the remotest sense to the prime minister fve just come from azkaban fudge had panted tipping a large amount of water out of the rim of his bowler hat into his pocket middle of the north sea you know nasty flight the dementors are in uproar he shuddered they have never had a breakout before anyway i had to come to you prime minister black a known muggle killer and may be planning to rejoin youknowwho but of course you do not even know who youknowwho is he had gazed hopelessly at the prime minister for a moment then said well sit down sit down id better fill you in have a whiskey page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the prime minister rather resented being told to sit down in his own office let alone offered his own whiskey but he sat nevertheless fudge pulled out his wand conjured two large glass full of amber liquid out of thin air pushed one of them into the prime minister hand and drew up a chair fudge had talked for more than an hour at one point he had refused to say a certain name aloud and wrote it instead on a piece of parchment which he had thrust into the prime minister whiskeyfree hand when at last fudge had stood up to leave the prime minister had stood up too so you think that he had squinted down at the name in his left hand lord vol hewhomustnotbenamed snarled fudge i am sorry you think that hewhomustnotbe named is still alive then well dumbledore say he is said fudge a he had fastened his pinstriped cloak under his chin but we have never found him if you ask me he not dangerous unless he got support so it black we ought to be worrying about you will put out that warning then excellent well i hope we do not see each other again prime minister good night but they had seen each other again le than a year later a harassedlooking fudge had appeared out of thin air in the cabinet room to inform the prime minister that there had been a spot of bother at the kwidditch or that wa what it had sounded like world cup and that several muggles had been involved but that the prime minister wa not to worry the fact that youknow who is mark had been seen again meant nothing fudge wa sure it wa an page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling isolated incident and the muggle liaison office wa dealing with all memory modification a they spoke oh and i almost forgot fudge had added were importing three foreign dragon and a sphinx for the triwizard tournament quite routine but the department for the regulation and control of magical creature tell me that it down in the rule book that we have to notify you if were bringing highly dangerous creature into the country i what dragon spluttered the prime minister yes three said fudge and a sphinx well good day to you the prime minister had hoped beyond hope that dragon and sphinx would be the worst of it but no le than two year later fudge had erupted out of the fire yet again this time with the news that there had been a mass breakout from azkaban a mass breakout repeated the prime minister hoarsely no need to worry no need to worry shouted fudge already with one foot in the flame well have them rounded up in no time just thought you ought to know and before the prime minister could shout now wait just one moment fudge had vanished in a shower of green spark whatever the press and the opposition might say the prime minister wa not a foolish man it had not escaped his notice that despite fudge assurance at their first meeting they were now seeing rather a lot of each other nor that fudge wa becoming more page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling flustered with each visit little though he liked to think about the minister of magic or a he always called fudge in his head the other minister the prime minister could not help but fear that the next time fudge appeared it would be with graver news still the sight therefore of fudge stepping out of the fire once more looking disheveled and fretful and sternly surprised that the prime minister did not know exactly why he wa there wa about the worst thing that had happened in the course of this extremely gloomy week how should i know what is going on in the er wizarding community snapped the prime minister now i have a country to run and quite enough concern at the moment without we have the same concern fudge interrupted the brockdale bridge did not wear out that wa not really a hurricane those murder were not the work of muggles and herbert chorleys family would be safer without him we are currently making arrangement to have him transferred to st mungos hospital for magical malady and injury the move should be effected tonight what do you i am afraid i what blustered the prime minister fudge took a great deep breath and said prime minister i am very sorry to have to tell you that he back hewhomustnotbenamed is back back when you say back he alive i mean the prime minister groped in his memory for the detail of that horrible conversation of three year previously when fudge had told him about the wizard who wa feared above all others the wizard page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling who had committed a thousand terrible crime before his mysterious disappearance fifteen year earlier yes alive said fudge that is i do not know is a man alive if he can not be killed i do not really understand it and dumbledore will not explain properly but anyway he certainly got a body and is walking and talking and killing so i suppose for the purpose of our discussion yes he alive the prime minister did not know what to say to this but a persistent habit of wishing to appear well informed on any subject that came up made him cast around for any detail he could remember of their previous conversation is serious black with er hewhomustnotbe named black black said fudge distractedly turning his bowler rapidly in his finger sirius black you mean merlin beard no black dead turn out we were er mistaken about black he wa innocent after all and he wa not in league with hewhomust notbenamed either i mean he added defensively spinning the bowler hat still faster all the evidence pointed we had more than fifty eyewitness but anyway a i say he dead murdered a a matter of fact on ministry of magic premise there is going to be an inquiry actually to his great surprise the prime minister felt a fleeting stab of pity for fudge at this point it wa however eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplace there had never been a murder in any of the government department under his charge not yet anyway page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling while the prime minister surreptitiously touched the wood of his desk fudge continued but black by theby now the point is were at war prime minister and step must be taken at war repeated the prime minister nervously surely that is a little bit of an overstatement hewhomustnotbenamed ha now been joined by those of his follower who broke out of azkaban in january said fudge speaking more and more rapidly and twirling his bowler so fast that it wa a limegreen blur since they have moved into the open they have been wreaking havoc the brockdale bridge he did it prime minister he threatened a mass muggle killing unless i stood aside for him and good grief so it your fault those people were killed and i am having to answer question about rusted rigging and corroded expansion joint and i do not know what else said the prime minister furiously my fault said fudge coloring up are you saying you would have caved in to blackmail like that maybe not said the prime minister standing up and striding about the room but i would have put all my effort into catching the blackmailer before he committed any such atrocity do you really think i wa not already making every effort demanded fudge heatedly every auror in the ministry wa and is trying to find him and round up his follower but we happen to be talking about one of the most powerful wizard of all time a wizard who ha eluded capture for almost three decade page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling so i suppose you are going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the west country too said the prime minister his temper rising with every pace he took it wa infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disaster and not to be able to tell the public almost worse than it being the government fault after all that wa no hurricane said fudge miserably excuse me barked the prime minister now positively stamping up and down tree uprooted roof ripped off lamppost bent horrible injury it wa the death eater said fudge hewhomust notbenameds follower and and we suspect giant involvement the prime minister stopped in his track a though he had hit an invisible wall what involvement fudge grimaced he used giant last time when he wanted to go for the grand effect he said the office of misinformation ha been working around the clock we have had team of obliviators out trying to modify the memory of all the muggles who saw what really happened we have got most of the department for the regulation and control of magical creature running around somerset but we can not find the giant it been a disaster you do not say said the prime minister furiously i will not deny that morale is pretty low at the ministry said fudge what with all that and then losing amelia bone losing who page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling amelia bone head of the department of magical law enforcement we think hewhomustnotbe named may have murdered her in person because she wa a very gifted witch and and all the evidence wa that she put up a real fight fudge cleared his throat and with an effort it seemed stopped spinning his bowler hat but that murder wa in the newspaper said the prime minister momentarily diverted from his anger our newspaper amelia bone it just said she wa a middleaged woman who lived alone it wa a a nasty killing wa not it it had rather a lot of publicity the police are baffled you see fudge sighed well of course they are he said killed in a room that wa locked from the inside wa not she we on the other hand know exactly who did it not that that get u any further toward catching him and then there wa emmeline vance maybe you did not hear about that one oh yes i did said the prime minister it happened just around the corner from here a a matter of fact the paper had a field day with it breakdown of law and order in the prime minister backyard and a if all that wa not enough said fudge barely listening to the prime minister we have got dementors swarming all over the place attacking people left right and center once upon a happier time this sentence would have been unintelligible to the prime minister but he wa wiser now i thought dementors guard the prisoner in azkaban he said cautiously page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling they did said fudge wearily but not anymore they have deserted the prison and joined hewhomust notbenamed i will not pretend that wa not a blow but said the prime minister with a sense of dawning horror did not you tell me they are the creature that drain hope and happiness out of people that is right and they are breeding that is what is causing all this mist the prime minister sank weakkneed into the nearest chair the idea of invisible creature swooping through the town and countryside spreading despair and hopelessness in his voter made him feel quite faint now see here fudge you have got to do something it your responsibility a minister of magic my dear prime minister you can not honestly think i am still minister of magic after all this i wa sacked three day ago the whole wizarding community ha been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight i have never known them so united in my whole term of office said fudge with a brave attempt at a smile the prime minister wa momentarily lost for word despite his indignation at the position into which he had been placed he still rather felt for the shrunken looking man sitting opposite him i am very sorry he said finally if there is anything i can do it very kind of you prime minister but there is nothing i wa sent here tonight to bring you up to date on recent event and to introduce you to my page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling successor i rather thought he would be here by now but of course he very busy at the moment with so much going on fudge looked around at the portrait of the ugly little man wearing the long curly silver wig who wa digging in his ear with the point of a quill catching fudge eye the portrait said hell be here in a moment he just finishing a letter to dumbledore i wish him luck said fudge sounding bitter for the first time i have been writing to dumbledore twice a day for the past fortnight but he will not budge if he would just been prepared to persuade the boy i might still be well maybe scrimgeour will have more success fudge subsided into what wa clearly an aggrieved silence but it wa broken almost immediately by the portrait which suddenly spoke in it crisp official voice to the prime minister of muggles requesting a meeting urgent kindly respond immediately rufus scrimgeour minister of magic yes yes fine said the prime minister distractedly and he barely flinched a the flame in the grate turned emerald green again rose up and revealed a second spinning wizard in their heart disgorging him moment later onto the antique rug fudge got to his foot and after a moment hesitation the prime minister did the same watching the new arrival straighten up dust down his long black robe and look around the prime minister first foolish thought wa that rufus scrimgeour looked rather like an old lion page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there were streak of gray in his mane of tawny hair and his bushy eyebrow he had keen yellowish eye behind a pair of wirerimmed spectacle and a certain rangy loping grace even though he walked with a slight limp there wa an immediate impression of shrewdness and toughness the prime minister thought he understood why the wizarding community preferred scrimgeour to fudge a a leader in these dangerous time how do you do said the prime minister politely holding out his hand scrimgeour grasped it briefly his eye scanning the room then pulled out a wand from under his robe fudge told you everything he asked striding over to the door and tapping the keyhole with his wand the prime minister heard the lock click er yes said the prime minister and if you do not mind id rather that door remained unlocked id rather not be interrupted said scrimgeour shortly or watched he added pointing his wand at the window so that the curtain swept across them right well i am a busy man so let u get down to business first of all we need to discus your security the prime minister drew himself up to his fullest height and replied i am perfectly happy with the security i have already got thank you very well were not scrimgeour cut in it will be a poor lookout for the muggles if their prime minister get put under the imperius curse the new secretary in your outer office page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tm not getting rid of kingsley shacklebolt if that is what you are suggesting said the prime minister hotly he highly efficient get through twice the work the rest of them that is because he a wizard said scrimgeour without a flicker of a smile a highly trained auror who ha been assigned to you for your protection now wait a moment declared the prime minister you can not just put your people into my office i decide who work for me i thought you were happy with shacklebolt said scrimgeour coldly i am that is to say i wa then there is no problem is there said scrimgeour i well a long a shacklebolts work continues to be er excellent said the prime minister lamely but scrimgeour barely seemed to hear him now about herbert chorley your junior minister he continued the one who ha been entertaining the public by impersonating a duck what about him asked the prime minister he ha clearly reacted to a poorly performed imperius curse said scrimgeour it addled his brain but he could still be dangerous he only quacking said the prime minister weakly surely a bit of a rest maybe go easy on the drink page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling a team of healer from st mungos hospital for magical malady and injury are examining him a we speak so far he ha attempted to strangle three of them said scrimgeour i think it best that we remove him from muggle society for a while i well hell be all right will not he said the prime minister anxiously scrimgeour merely shrugged already moving back toward the fireplace well that is really all i had to say i will keep you posted of development prime minister or at least i shall probably be too busy to come personally in which case i shall send fudge here he ha consented to stay on in an advisory capacity fudge attempted to smile but wa unsuccessful he merely looked a though he had a toothache scrimgeour wa already rummaging in his pocket for the mysterious powder that turned the fire green the prime minister gazed hopelessly at the pair of them for a moment then the word he had fought to suppress all evening burst from him at last but for heaven sake you are wizard you can do magic surely you can sort out well anything scrimgeour turned slowly on the spot and exchanged an incredulous look with fudge who really did manage a smile this time a he said kindly the trouble is the other side can do magic too prime minister and with that the two wizard stepped one after the other into the bright green fire and vanished page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling spinner end many mile away the chilly mist that had pressed against the prime minister window drifted over a dirty river that wound between overgrown rubbish strewn bank an immense chimney relic of a disused mill reared up shadowy and ominous there wa no sound apart from the whisper of the black water and no sign of life apart from a scrawny fox that had slunk down the bank to nose hopefully at some old fishandchip wrapping in the tall grass but then with a very faint pop a slim hooded figure appeared out of thin air on the edge of the river the fox froze wary eye fixed upon this strange new phenomenon the figure seemed to take it bearing for a few moment then set off with light quick stride it long cloak rustling over the grass with a second and louder pop another hooded figure materialized wait page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the harsh cry startled the fox now crouching almost flat in the undergrowth it leapt from it hiding place and up the bank there wa a flash of green light a yelp and the fox fell back to the ground dead the second figure turned over the animal with it toe just a fox said a woman voice dismissively from under the hood i thought perhaps an auror cissy wait but her quarry who had paused and looked back at the flash of light wa already scrambling up the bank the fox had just fallen down cissy narcissa listen to me the second woman caught the first and seized her arm but the other wrenched it away go back bella you must listen to me i have listened already i have made my decision leave me alone the woman named narcissa gained the top of the bank where a line of old railing separated the river from a narrow cobbled street the other woman bella followed at once side by side they stood looking across the road at the row and row of dilapidated brick house their window dull and blind in the darkness he life here asked bella in a voice of contempt here in this muggle dunghill we must be the first of our kind ever to set foot page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but narcissa wa not listening she had slipped through a gap in the rusty railing and wa already hurrying across the road cissy wait bella followed her cloak streaming behind and saw narcissa darting through an alley between the house into a second almost identical street some of the streetlamps were broken the two woman were running between patch of light and deep darkness the pursuer caught up with her prey just a she turned another corner this time succeeding in catching hold of her arm and swinging her around so that they faced each other cissy you must not do this you can not trust him the dark lord trust him doe not he the dark lord is i believe mistaken bella panted and her eye gleamed momentarily under her hood a she looked around to check that they were indeed alone in any case we were told not to speak of the plan to anyone this is a betrayal of the dark lord let go bella snarled narcissa and she drew a wand from beneath her cloak holding it threateningly in the others face bella merely laughed cissy your own sister you would not there is nothing i would not do anymore narcissa breathed a note of hysteria in her voice and a she brought down the wand like a knife there wa another flash of light bella let go of her sister arm a though burned page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling narcisscd but narcissa had rushed ahead rubbing her hand her pursuer followed again keeping her distance now a they moved deeper into the deserted labyrinth of brick house at last narcissa hurried up a street named spinner end over which the towering mill chimney seemed to hover like a giant admonitory finger her footstep echoed on the cobble a she passed boarded and broken window until she reached the very last house where a dim light glimmered through the curtain in a downstairs room she had knocked on the door before bella cursing under her breath had caught up together they stood waiting panting slightly breathing in the smell of the dirty river that wa carried to them on the night breeze after a few second they heard movement behind the door and it opened a crack a sliver of a man could be seen looking out at them a man with long black hair parted in curtain around a sallow face and black eye narcissa threw back her hood she wa so pale that she seemed to shine in the darkness the long blonde hair streaming down her back gave her the look of a drowned person narcissa said the man opening the door a little wider so that the light fell upon her and her sister too what a pleasant surprise severus she said in a strained whisper may i speak to you it urgent but of course page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he stood back to allow her to pas him into the house her stillhooded sister followed without invitation snape she said curtly a she passed him bellatrix he replied his thin mouth curling into a slightly mocking smile a he closed the door with a snap behind them they had stepped directly into a tiny sitting room which had the feeling of a dark padded cell the wall were completely covered in book most of them bound in old black or brown leather a threadbare sofa an old armchair and a rickety table stood grouped together in a pool of dim light cast by a candlefilled lamp hung from the ceiling the place had an air of neglect a though it wa not usually inhabited snape gestured narcissa to the sofa she threw off her cloak cast it aside and sat down staring at her white and trembling hand clasped in her lap bellatrix lowered her hood more slowly dark a her sister wa fair with heavily lidded eye and a strong jaw she did not take her gaze from snape a she moved to stand behind narcissa so what can i do for you snape asked settling himself in the armchair opposite the two sister we we are alone are not we narcissa asked quietly yes of course well wormtails here but were not counting vermin are we he pointed his wand at the wall of book behind him and with a bang a hidden door flew open revealing a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling narrow staircase upon which a small man stood frozen a you have clearly realized wormtail we have guest said snape lazily the man crept hunchbacked down the last few step and moved into the room he had small watery eye a pointed nose and wore an unpleasant simper his left hand wa caressing his right which looked a though it wa encased in a bright silver glove narcissa he said in a squeaky voice and bellatrix how charming wormtail will get u drink if you would like them said snape and then he will return to his bedroom wormtail winced a though snape had thrown something at him i am not your servant he squeaked avoiding snape s eye really i wa under the impression that the dark lord placed you here to assist me to assist yes but not to make you drink and and clean your house i had no idea wormtail that you were craving more dangerous assignment said snape silkily this can be easily arranged i shall speak to the dark lord i can speak to him myself if i want to of course you can said snape sneering but in the meantime bring u drink some of the elfmade wine will do page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling wormtail hesitated for a moment looking a though he might argue but then turned and headed through a second hidden door they heard banging and a clinking of glass within second he wa back bearing a dusty bottle and three glass upon a tray he dropped these on the rickety table and scurried from their presence slamming the bookcovered door behind him snape poured out three glass of bloodred wine and handed two of them to the sister narcissa murmured a word of thanks whilst bellatrix said nothing but continued to glower at snape this did not seem to discompose him on the contrary he looked rather amused the dark lord he said raising his glass and draining it the sister copied him snape refilled their glass a narcissa took her second drink she said in a rush severus i am sorry to come here like this but i had to see you i think you are the only one who can help me snape held up a hand to stop her then pointed his wand again at the concealed staircase door there wa a loud bang and a squeal followed by the sound of wormtail scurrying back up the stair my apology said snape he ha lately taken to listening at door i do not know what he mean by it you were saying narcissa she took a great shuddering breath and started again severus i know i ought not to be here i have been told to say nothing to anyone but page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling then you ought to hold your tongue snarled bellatrix particularly in present company present company repeated snape sardonically and what am i to understand by that bellatrix that i do not trust you snape a you very well know narcissa let out a noise that might have been a dry sob and covered her face with her hand snape set his glass down upon the table and sat back again his hand upon the arm of his chair smiling into bellatrixs glowering face narcissa i think we ought to hear what bellatrix is bursting to say it will save tedious interruption well continue bellatrix said snape why is it that you do not trust me a hundred reason she said loudly striding out from behind the sofa to slam her glass upon the table where to start where were you when the dark lord fell why did you never make any attempt to find him when he vanished what have you been doing all these year that you have lived in dumbledores pocket why did you stop the dark lord procuring the sorcerer stone why did you not return at once when the dark lord wa reborn where were you a few week ago when we battled to retrieve the prophecy for the dark lord and why snape is harry potter still alive when you have had him at your mercy for five year she paused her chest rising and falling rapidly the color high in her cheek behind her narcissa sat motionless her face still hidden in her hand snape smiled page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling before i answer you oh yes bellatrix i am going to answer you can carry my word back to the others who whisper behind my back and carry false tale of my treachery to the dark lord before i answer you i say let me ask a question in turn do you really think that the dark lord ha not asked me each and every one of those question and do you really think that had i not been able to give satisfactory answer i would be sitting here talking to you she hesitated i know he belief you but you think he is mistaken or that i have somehow hoodwinked him fooled the dark lord the greatest wizard the most accomplished legilimens the world ha ever seen bellatrix said nothing but looked for the first time a little discomfited snape did not press the point he picked up his drink again sipped it and continued you ask where i wa when the dark lord fell i wa where he had ordered me to be at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry because he wished me to spy upon albus dumbledore you know i presume that it wa on the dark lord order that i took up the post she nodded almost imperceptibly and then opened her mouth but snape forestalled her you ask why i did not attempt to find him when he vanished for the same reason that avery yaxley the carrows greyback lucius he inclined his head slightly to narcissa and many others did not attempt to find him i believed him finished i am not proud of it i wa wrong but there it is if he had page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling not forgiven we who lost faith at that time he would have very few follower left he would have me said bellatrix passionately i who spent many year in azkaban for him yes indeed most admirable said snape in a bored voice of course you were not a lot of use to him in prison but the gesture wa undoubtedly fine gesture she shrieked in her fury she looked slightly mad while i endured the dementors you remained at hogwarts comfortably playing dumbledores pet not quite said snape calmly he would not give me the defense against the dark art job you know seemed to think it might ah bring about a relapse tempt me into my old way this wa your sacrifice for the dark lord not to teach your favorite subject she jeered why did you stay there all that time snape still spying on dumbledore for a master you believed dead hardly said snape although the dark lord is pleased that i never deserted my post i had sixteen year of information on dumbledore to give him when he returned a rather more useful welcomeback present than endless reminiscence of how unpleasant azkaban is but you stayed yes bellatrix i stayed said snape betraying a hint of impatience for the first time i had a comfortable job that i preferred to a stint in azkaban they were rounding up the death eater you know dumbledores protection kept me out of jail it wa page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling most convenient and i used it i repeat the dark lord doe not complain that i stayed so i do not see why you do i think you next wanted to know he pressed on a little more loudly for bellatrix showed every sign of interrupting why i stood between the dark lord and the sorcerer stone that is easily answered he did not know whether he could trust me he thought like you that i had turned from faithful death eater to dumbledores stooge he wa in a pitiable condition very weak sharing the body of a mediocre wizard he did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to dumbledore or the ministry i deeply regret that he did not trust me he would have returned to power three year sooner a it wa i saw only greedy and unworthy quirrell attempting to steal the stone and i admit i did all i could to thwart him bellatrixs mouth twisted a though she had taken an unpleasant dose of medicine but you did not return when he came back you did not fly back to him at once when you felt the dark mark burn correct i returned two hour later i returned on dumbledores order on dumbledores she began in tone of outrage think said snape impatient again think by waiting two hour just two hour i ensured that i could remain at hogwarts a a spy by allowing dumbledore to think that i wa only returning to the dark lord side because i wa ordered to i have been able to pas information on dumbledore and the order of the phoenix ever since consider bellatrix page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the dark mark had been growing stronger for month i knew he must be about to return all the death eater knew i had plenty of time to think about what i wanted to do to plan my next move to escape like karkaroff did not i the dark lord initial displeasure at my lateness vanished entirely i assure you when i explained that i remained faithful although dumbledore thought i wa his man yes the dark lord thought that i had left him forever but he wa wrong but what use have you been sneered bellatrix what useful information have we had from you my information ha been conveyed directly to the dark lord said snape if he chooses not to share it with you he share everything with me said bellatrix firing up at once he call me his most loyal his most faithful doe he said snape his voice delicately inflected to suggest his disbelief doe he still after the fiasco at the ministry that wa not my fault said bellatrix flushing the dark lord ha in the past entrusted me with his most precious if lucius had not do not you dare do not you dare blame my husband said narcissa in a low and deadly voice looking up at her sister there is no point apportioning blame said snape smoothly what is done is done page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but not by you said bellatrix furiously no you were once again absent while the rest of u ran danger were you not snape my order were to remain behind said snape perhaps you disagree with the dark lord perhaps you think that dumbledore would not have noticed if i had joined force with the death eater to fight the order of the phoenix and forgive me you speak of danger you were facing six teenager were you not they were joined a you very well know by half of the order before long snarled bellatrix and while we are on the subject of the order you still claim you can not reveal the whereabouts of their headquarters do not you i am not the secretkeeper i can not speak the name of the place you understand how the enchantment work i think the dark lord is satisfied with the information i have passed him on the order it led a perhaps you have guessed to the recent capture and murder of emmeline vance and it certainly helped dispose of sirius black though i give you full credit for finishing him off he inclined his head and toasted her her expression did not soften you are avoiding my last question snape harry potter you could have killed him at any point in the past five year you have not done it why have you discussed this matter with the dark lord asked snape he lately we i am asking you snape page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling if i had murdered harry potter the dark lord could not have used his blood to regenerate making him invincible you claim you foresaw his use of the boy she jeered i do not claim it i had no idea of his plan i have already confessed that i thought the dark lord dead i am merely trying to explain why the dark lord is not sorry that potter survived at least until a year ago but why did you keep him alive have you not understood me it wa only dumbledores protection that wa keeping me out of azkaban do you disagree that murdering his favorite student might have turned him against me but there wa more to it than that i should remind you that when potter first arrived at hogwarts there were still many story circulating about him rumor that he himself wa a great dark wizard which wa how he had survived the dark lord attack indeed many of the dark lord old follower thought potter might be a standard around which we could all rally once more i wa curious i admit it and not at all inclined to murder him the moment he set foot in the castle of course it became apparent to me very quickly that he had no extraordinary talent at all he ha fought his way out of a number of tight corner by a simple combination of sheer luck and more talented friend he is mediocre to the last degree though a obnoxious and selfsatisfied a wa his father before him i have done my utmost to have him thrown out of hogwarts where i believe he scarcely belongs but kill him or allow him to be killed in front of me i page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling would have been a fool to risk it with dumbledore close at hand and through all this we are supposed to believe dumbledore ha never suspected you asked bellatrix he ha no idea of your true allegiance he trust you implicitly still i have played my part well said snape and you overlook dumbledores greatest weakness he ha to believe the best of people i spun him a tale of deepest remorse when i joined his staff fresh from my death eater day and he embraced me with open arm though a i say never allowing me nearer the dark art than he could help dumbledore ha been a great wizard oh yes he ha for bellatrix had made a scathing noise the dark lord acknowledges it i am pleased to say however that dumbledore is growing old the duel with the dark lord last month shook him he ha since sustained a serious injury because his reaction are slower than they once were but through all these year he ha never stopped trusting severus snape and therein lie my great value to the dark lord bellatrix still looked unhappy though she appeared unsure how best to attack snape next taking advantage of her silence snape turned to her sister now you came to ask me for help narcissa narcissa looked up at him her face eloquent with despair yes severus i i think you are the only one who can help me i have nowhere else to turn lucius is in jail and page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she closed her eye and two large tear seeped from beneath her eyelid the dark lord ha forbidden me to speak of it narcissa continued her eye still closed he wish none to know of the plan it is very secret but if he ha forbidden it you ought not to speak said snape at once the dark lord word is law narcissa gasped a though he had doused her with cold water bellatrix looked satisfied for the first time since she had entered the house there she said triumphantly to her sister even snape say so you were told not to talk so hold your silence but snape had gotten to his foot and strode to the small window peered through the curtain at the deserted street then closed them again with a jerk he turned around to face narcissa frowning it so happens that i know of the plan he said in a low voice i am one of the few the dark lord ha told nevertheless had i not been in on the secret narcissa you would have been guilty of great treachery to the dark lord i thought you must know about it said narcissa breathing more freely he trust you so severus you know about the plan said bellatrix her fleeting expression of satisfaction replaced by a look of outrage you know certainly said snape but what help do you require narcissa if you are imagining i can persuade page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the dark lord to change his mind i am afraid there is no hope none at all severus she whispered tear sliding down her pale cheek my son my only son draco should be proud said bellatrix indifferently the dark lord is granting him a great honor and i will say this for draco he is not shrinking away from his duty he seems glad of a chance to prove himself excited at the prospect narcissa began to cry in earnest gazing beseechingly all the while at snape that is because he is sixteen and ha no idea what lie in store why severus why my son it is too dangerous this is vengeance for luciuss mistake i know it snape said nothing he looked away from the sight of her tear a though they were indecent but he could not pretend not to hear her that is why he chosen draco is not it she persisted to punish lucius if draco succeeds said snape still looking away from her he will be honored above all others but he will not succeed sobbed narcissa how can he when the dark lord himself bellatrix gasped narcissa seemed to lose her nerve i only meant that nobody ha yet succeeded severus please you are you have always been draco favorite teacher you are luciuss old friend i beg you you are the dark lord page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling favorite his most trusted advisor will you speak to him persuade him the dark lord will not be persuaded and i am not stupid enough to attempt it said snape flatly i can not pretend that the dark lord is not angry with lucius lucius wa supposed to be in charge he got himself captured along with how many others and failed to retrieve the prophecy into the bargain yes the dark lord is angry narcissa very angry indeed then i am right he ha chosen draco in revenge choked narcissa he doe not mean him to succeed he want him to be killed trying when snape said nothing narcissa seemed to lose what little selfrestraint she still possessed standing up she staggered to snape and seized the front of his robe her face close to his her tear falling onto his chest she gasped you could do it you could do it instead of draco severus you would succeed of course you would and he would reward you beyond all of u snape caught hold of her wrist and removed her clutching hand looking down into her tear tained face he said slowly he intends me to do it in the end i think but he is determined that draco should try first you see in the unlikely event that draco succeeds i shall be able to remain at hogwarts a little longer fulfilling my useful role a spy in other word it doe not matter to him if draco is killed the dark lord is very angry repeated snape quietly he failed to hear the prophecy you know a well a i do narcissa that he doe not forgive easily page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she crumpled falling at his foot sobbing and moaning on the floor my only son my only son you should be proud said bellatrix ruthlessly if i had son i would be glad to give them up to the service of the dark lord narcissa gave a little scream of despair and clutched at her long blonde hair snape stooped seized her by the arm lifted her up and steered her back onto the sofa he then poured her more wine and forced the glass into her hand narcissa that is enough drink this listen to me she quieted a little slopping wine down herself she took a shaky sip it might be possible for me to help draco she sat up her face paperwhite her eye huge severus oh severus you would help him would you look after him see he come to no harm i can try she flung away her glass it skidded across the table a she slid off the sofa into a kneeling position at snape s foot seized his hand in both of hers and pressed her lip to it if you are there to protect him severus will you swear it will you make the unbreakable vow the unbreakable vow page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling snapes expression wa blank unreadable bellatrix however let out a cackle of triumphant laughter are not you listening narcissa oh hell try i am sure the usual empty word the usual slithering out of action oh on the dark lord order of course snape did not look at bellatrix his black eye were fixed upon narcissas tearfilled blue one a she continued to clutch his hand certainly narcissa i shall make the unbreakable vow he said quietly perhaps your sister will consent to be our bonder bellatrixs mouth fell open snape lowered himself so that he wa kneeling opposite narcissa beneath bellatrixs astonished gaze they grasped right hand you will need your wand bellatrix said snape coldly she drew it still looking astonished and you will need to move a little closer he said she stepped forward so that she stood over them and placed the tip of her wand on their linked hand narcissa spoke will you severus watch over my son draco a he attempt to fulfill the dark lord wish i will said snape a thin tongue of brilliant flame issued from the wand and wound it way around their hand like a redhot wire page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and will you to the best of your ability protect him from harm i will said snape a second tongue of flame shot from the wand and interlinked with the first making a fine glowing chain and should it prove necessary if it seems draco will fail whispered narcissa snapes hand twitched within hers but he did not draw away will you carry out the deed that the dark lord ha ordered draco to perform there wa a moment silence bellatrix watched her wand upon their clasped hand her eye wide i will said snape bellatrixs astounded face glowed red in the blaze of a third tongue of flame which shot from the wand twisted with the others and bound itself thickly around their clasped hand like a rope like a fiery snake page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling will and will not harry potter wa snoring loudly he had been sitting in a chair beside his bedroom window for the best part of four hour staring out at the darkening street and had finally fallen asleep with one side of his face pressed against the cold windowpane his glass askew and his mouth wide open the misty fug his breath had left on the window sparkled in the orange glare of the streetlamp outside and the artificial light drained his face of all color so that he looked ghostly beneath his shock of untidy black hair the room wa strewn with various possession and a good smattering of rubbish owl feather apple core and sweet wrapper littered the floor a number of spellbooks lay higgledypiggledy among the tangled robe on his bed and a mess of newspaper sat in a puddle of light on his desk the headline of one blared harry potter the chosen one page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling rumor continue to fly about the mysterious recent disturbance at the ministry of magic during which hewhomustnotbenamed wa sighted once more were not allowed to talk about it do not ask me anything said one agitated obliviator who refused to give his name a he left the ministry last night nevertheless highly placed source within the ministry have confirmed that the disturbance centered on the fabled hall of prophecy though ministry spokeswizards have hitherto refused even to confirm the existence of such a place a growing number of the wizarding community believe that the death eater now serving sentence in azkaban for trespass and attempted theft were attempting to steal a prophecy the nature of that prophecy is unknown although speculation is rife that it concern harry potter the only person ever known to have survived the killing curse and who is also known to have been at the ministry on the night in question some are going so far a to call potter the chosen one believing that the prophecy name him a the only one who will be able to rid u of he whomustnotbenamed the current whereabouts of the prophecy if it exists are unknown although ctd page column a second newspaper lay beside the first this one bore the headline scrimgeour succeeds fudge

harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling rufus scrimgeour previously head of the auror office in the department of magical law enforcement ha succeeded cornelius fudge a minister of magic the appointment ha largely been greeted with enthusiasm by the wizarding community though rumor of a rift between the new minister and albus dumbledore newly reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot surfaced within hour of scrimgeour taking office scrimgeours representative admitted that he had met with dumbledore at once upon taking possession of the top job but refused to comment on the topic under discussion albus dumbledore is known to ctd page column to the left of this paper sat another which had been folded so that a story bearing the title ministry guarantee student safety wa visible newly appointed minister of magic rufus scrimgeour spoke today of the tough new measure taken by his ministry to ensure the safety of student returning to hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry this autumn for obvious reason the ministry will not be going into detail about it stringent new security plan said the minister although an insider confirmed that measure include defensive spell and charm a complex array of countercurses and a small task force of aurors dedicated solely to the protection of hogwarts school most seem reassured by the new minister tough stand on student safety said mr augusta longbottom my grandson neville a good friend of harry potter incidentally who fought the death eater alongside him at the ministry in june and page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but the rest of this story wa obscured by the large birdcage standing on top of it inside it wa a magnificent snowy owl her amber eye surveyed the room imperiously her head swiveling occasionally to gaze at her snoring master once or twice she clicked her beak impatiently but harry wa too deeply asleep to hear her a large trunk stood in the very middle of the room it lid wa open it looked expectant yet it wa almost empty but for a residue of old underwear sweet empty ink bottle and broken quill that coated the very bottom nearby on the floor lay a purple leaflet emblazoned with the word issued on behalf of the ministry of magic protecting your home and family against dark force the wizarding community is currently under threat from an organization calling itself the death eater observing the following simple security guideline will help protect you your family and your home from attack you are advised not to leave the house alone particular care should be taken

building do not enter but contact the auror office immediately unconfirmed sighting suggest that the death eater may now be using inferi see page any sighting of an inferius or encounter with same should be reported to the ministry immediately harry grunted in his sleep and his face slid down the window an inch or so making his glass still more lopsided but he did not wake up an alarm clock repaired by harry several year ago ticked loudly on the sill showing one minute to eleven beside it held in place by harrys relaxed hand wa a piece of parchment covered in thin slanting writing harry had read this letter so often since it arrival three day ago that although it had been delivered in a tightly furled scroll it now lay quite flat dear harry if it is convenient to you i shall call at number four privet drive this coming friday at eleven pm to escort you to the burrow where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holiday page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling if you are agreeable i should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which i hope to attend on the way to the burrow i shall explain this more fully when i see you kindly send your answer by return of this owl hoping to see you this friday i am yours most sincerely albus dumbledore though he already knew it by heart harry had been stealing glance at this missive every few minute since seven of the clock that evening when he had first taken up his position beside his bedroom window which had a reasonable view of both end of privet drive he knew it wa pointless to keep rereading dumbledore s word harry had sent back his yes with the delivering owl a requested and all he could do now wa wait either dumbledore wa going to come or he wa not but harry had not packed it just seemed too good to be true that he wa going to be rescued from the dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company he could not shrug off the feeling that something wa going to go wrong his reply to dumbledore s letter might have gone astray dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him the letter might turn out not to be from dumbledore at all but a trick or joke or trap harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again the only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey wa to shut his snowy owl hedwig safely in her cage page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the minute hand on the alarm clock reached the number twelve and at that precise moment the streetlamp outside the window went out harry awoke a though the sudden darkness were an alarm hastily straightening his glass and unsticking his cheek from the glass he pressed his nose against the window instead and squinted down at the pavement a tall figure in a long billowing cloak wa walking up the garden path harry jumped up a though he had received an electric shock knocked over his chair and started snatching anything and everything within reach from the floor and throwing it into the trunk even a he lobbed a set of robe two spellbooks and a packet of crisp across the room the doorbell rang downstairs in the living room his uncle vernon shouted who the blaze is calling at this time of night harry froze with a brass telescope in one hand and a pair of trainer in the other he had completely forgotten to warn the dursleys that dumbledore might be coming feeling both panicky and close to laughter he clambered over the trunk and wrenched open his bedroom door in time to hear a deep voice say good evening you must be mr dursley i daresay harry ha told you i would be coming for him harry ran down the stair two at a time coming to an abrupt halt several step from the bottom a long experience had taught him to remain out of arm reach of his uncle whenever possible there in the doorway stood a tall thin man with waistlength silver hair and beard halfmoon spectacle were perched on his crooked nose and he wa wearing a long black traveling cloak and a pointed hat vernon dursley whose mustache wa quite a bushy a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore s though black and who wa wearing a puce dressing gown wa staring at the visitor a though he could not believe his tiny eye judging by your look of stunned disbelief harry did not warn you that i wa coming said dumbledore pleasantly however let u assume that you have invited me warmly into your house it is unwise to linger overlong on doorstep in these troubled time he stepped smartly over the threshold and closed the front door behind him it is a long time since my last visit said dumbledore peering down his crooked nose at uncle vernon i must say your agapanthus are flourishing vernon dursley said nothing at all harry did not doubt that speech would return to him and soon the vein pulsing in his uncle temple wa reaching danger point but something about dumbledore seemed to have robbed him temporarily of breath it might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance but it might too have been that even uncle vernon could sense that here wa a man whom it would be very difficult to bully ah good evening harry said dumbledore looking up at him through his halfmoon glass with a most satisfied expression excellent excellent these word seemed to rouse uncle vernon it wa clear that a far a he wa concerned any man who could look at harry and say excellent wa a man with whom he could never see eye to eye i do not mean to be rude he began in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yet sadly accidental rudeness occurs alarmingly often dumbledore finished the sentence gravely best to say nothing at all my dear man ah and this must be petunia the kitchen door had opened and there stood harrys aunt wearing rubber glove and a housecoat over her nightdress clearly halfway through her usual pre bedtime wipedown of all the kitchen surface her rather horsey face registered nothing but shock albus dumbledore said dumbledore when uncle vernon failed to effect an introduction we have corresponded of course harry thought this an odd way of reminding aunt petunia that he had once sent her an exploding letter but aunt petunia did not challenge the term and this must be your son dudley dudley had that moment peered round the living room door his large blond head rising out of the stripy collar of his pajama looked oddly disembodied his mouth gaping in astonishment and fear dumbledore waited a moment or two apparently to see whether any of the dursleys were going to say anything but a the silence stretched on he smiled shall we assume that you have invited me into your sitting room dudley scrambled out of the way a dumbledore passed him harry still clutching the telescope and trainer jumped the last few stair and followed dumbledore who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and wa taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest he looked quite extraordinarily out of place page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling are not are not we leaving sir harry asked anxiously yes indeed we are but there are a few matter we need to discus first said dumbledore and i would prefer not to do so in the open we shall trespass upon your aunt and uncle hospitality only a little longer you will will you vernon dursley had entered the room petunia at his shoulder and dudley skulking behind them both yes said dumbledore simply i shall he drew his wand so rapidly that harry barely saw it with a casual flick the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knee out from under all three of the dursley s so that they collapsed upon it in a heap another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to it original position we may a well be comfortable said dumbledore pleasantly a he replaced his wand in his pocket harry saw that his hand wa blackened and shriveled it looked a though his flesh had been burned away sir what happened to your later harry said dumbledore please sit down harry took the remaining armchair choosing not to look at the dursleys who seemed stunned into silence page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment dumbledore said to uncle vernon but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness a third twitch of the wand and a dusty bottle and five glass appeared in midair the bottle tipped and poured a generous measure of honeycolored liquid into each of the glass which then floated to each person in the room madam rosmertas finest oakmatured mead said dumbledore raising his glass to harry who caught hold of his own and sipped he had never tasted anything like it before but enjoyed it immensely the dursleys after quick scared look at one another tried to ignore their glass completely a difficult feat a they were nudging them gently on the side of their head harry could not suppress a suspicion that dumbledore wa rather enjoying himself well harry said dumbledore turning toward him a difficulty ha arisen which i hope you will be able to solve for u by u i mean the order of the phoenix but first of all i must tell you that sirius will wa discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned over on the sofa uncle vernons head turned but harry did not look at him nor could he think of anything to say except oh right this is in the main fairly straightforward dumbledore went on you add a reasonable amount of gold to your account at gringotts and you inherit all of sirius personal possession the slightly problematic part of the legacy page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling his godfather dead said uncle vernon loudly from the sofa dumbledore and harry both turned to look at him the glass of mead wa now knocking quite insistently on the side of vernons head he attempted to beat it away he dead his godfather yes said dumbledore he did not ask harry why he had not confided in the dursleys our problem he continued to harry a if there had been no interruption is that sirius also left you number twelve grimmauld place he been left a house said uncle vernon greedily his small eye narrowing but nobody answered him you can keep using it a headquarters said harry i do not care you can have it i do not really want it harry never wanted to set foot in number twelve grimmauld place again if he could help it he thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of sirius prowling it dark musty room alone imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave that is generous said dumbledore we have however vacated the building temporarily why well said dumbledore ignoring the muttering of uncle vernon who wa now being rapped smartly over the head by the persistent glass of mead black family tradition decreed that the house wa handed down the direct line to the next male with the name of black sirius wa the very last of the line a his younger brother regulus predeceased him and both were childless while his will make it perfectly plain that he want you to have the house it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ha been set upon the place to ensure that it can not be owned by anyone other than a pureblood a vivid image of the shrieking spitting portrait of sirius mother that hung in the hall of number twelve grimmauld place flashed into harrys mind i bet there ha he said quite said dumbledore and if such an enchantment exists then the ownership of the house is most likely to pas to the eldest of sirius living relative which would mean his cousin bellatrix lestrange without realizing what he wa doing harry sprang to his foot the telescope and trainer in his lap rolled across the floor bellatrix lestrange sirius killer inherit his house no he said well obviously we would prefer that she did not get it either said dumbledore calmly the situation is fraught with complication we do not know whether the enchantment we ourselves have placed upon it for example making it unplottable will hold now that ownership ha passed from sirius hand it might be that bellatrix will arrive on the doorstep at any moment naturally we had to move out until such time a we have clarified the position but how are you going to find out if i am allowed to own it fortunately said dumbledore there is a simple test he placed his empty glass on a small table beside his chair but before he could do anything else uncle page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling vernon shouted will you get these ruddy thing off u harry looked around all three of the dursleys were cowering with their arm over their head a their glass bounced up and down on their skull their content flying everywhere oh i am so sorry said dumbledore politely and he raised his wand again all three glass vanished but it would have been better manner to drink it you know it looked a though uncle vernon wa bursting with any number of unpleasant retort but he merely shrank back into the cushion with aunt petunia and dudley and said nothing keeping his small piggy eye on dumbledore s wand you see dumbledore said turning back to harry and again speaking a though uncle vernon had not uttered if you have indeed inherited the house you have also inherited he flicked his wand for a fifth time there wa a loud crack and a houseelf appeared with a snout for a nose giant bat ear and enormous bloodshot eye crouching on the dursleys shag carpet and covered in grimy rag aunt petunia let out a hairraising shriek nothing this filthy had entered her house in living memory dudley drew his large bare pink foot off the floor and sat with them raised almost above his head a though he thought the creature might run up his pajama trouser and uncle vernon bellowed what the hell is that kreacher finished dumbledore page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling kreacher will not kreacher will not kreacher will not croaked the houseelf quite a loudly a uncle vernon stamping his long gnarled foot and pulling his ear kreacher belongs to miss bellatrix oh yes kreacher belongs to the black kreacher want his new mistress kreacher will not go to the potter brat kreacher will not will not will not a you can see harry said dumbledore loudly over kreachers continued croak of will not will not will not kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pas into your ownership i do not care said harry again looking with disgust at the writhing stamping houseelf i do not want him will not will not will not will not you would prefer him to pas into the ownership of bellatrix lestrange bearing in mind that he ha lived at the headquarters of the order of the phoenix for the past year will not will not will not will not harry stared at dumbledore he knew that kreacher could not be permitted to go and live with bellatrix lestrange but the idea of owning him of having responsibility for the creature that had betrayed sirius wa repugnant give him an order said dumbledore if he ha passed into your ownership he will have to obey if not then we shall have to think of some other mean of keeping him from his rightful mistress will not will not will not will not page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling kreachers voice had risen to a scream harry could think of nothing to say except kreacher shut up it looked for a moment a though kreacher wa going to choke he grabbed his throat his mouth still working furiously his eye bulging after a few second of frantic gulping he threw himself face forward onto the carpet aunt petunia whimpered and beat the floor with his hand and foot giving himself over to a violent but entirely silent tantrum well that simplifies matter said dumbledore cheerfully it seems that sirius knew what he wa doing you are the rightful owner of number twelve grimmauld place and of kreacher do i do i have to keep him with me harry asked aghast a kreacher thrashed around at his foot not if you do not want to said dumbledore if i might make a suggestion you could send him to hogwarts to work in the kitchen there in that way the other houseelves could keep an eye on him yeah said harry in relief yeah ill do that er kreacher i want you to go to hogwarts and work in the kitchen there with the other houseelves kreacher who wa now lying flat on his back with his arm and leg in the air gave harry one upsidedown look of deepest loathing and with another loud crack vanished good said dumbledore there is also the matter of the hippogriff buckbeak hagrid ha been looking after him since sirius died but buckbeak is yours now so if you would prefer to make different arrangement page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no said harry at once he can stay with hagrid i think buckbeak would prefer that hagrid will be delighted said dumbledore smiling he wa thrilled to see buckbeak again incidentally we have decided in the interest of buckbeaks safety to rechristen him witherwings for the time being though i doubt that the ministry would ever guess he is the hippogriff they once sentenced to death now harry is your trunk packed erm doubtful that i would turn up dumbledore suggested shrewdly ill just go and er finish off said harry hastily hurrying to pick up his fallen telescope and trainer it took him a little over ten minute to track down everything he needed at last he had managed to extract his invisibility cloak from under the bed screwed the top back on his jar of colorchange ink and forced the lid of his trunk shut on his cauldron then heaving his trunk in one hand and holding hedwigs cage in the other he made his way back downstairs he wa disappointed to discover that dumbledore wa not waiting in the hall which meant that he had to return to the living room nobody wa talking dumbledore wa humming quietly apparently quite at his ease but the atmosphere wa thicker than cold custard and harry did not dare look at the dursleys a he said professor i am ready now page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling good said dumbledore just one last thing then and he turned to speak to the dursleys once more a you will no doubt be aware harry come of age in a year time no said aunt petunia speaking for the first time since dumbledores arrival i am sorry said dumbledore politely no he doe not he a month younger than dudley and dudders doe not turn eighteen until the year after next ah said dumbledore pleasantly but in the wizarding world we come of age at seventeen uncle vernon muttered preposterous but dumbledore ignored him now a you already know the wizard called lord voldemort ha returned to this country the wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare harry whom lord voldemort ha already attempted to kill on a number of occasion is in even greater danger now than the day when i left him upon your doorstep fifteen year ago with a letter explaining about his parent murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him a though he were your own dumbledore paused and although his voice remained light and calm and he gave no obvious sign of anger harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the dursleys drew very slightly closer together page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you did not do a i asked you have never treated harry a a son he ha known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hand the best that can be said is that he ha at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you both aunt petunia and uncle vernon looked around instinctively a though expecting to see someone other than dudley squeezed between them u mistreat dudders what dyou began uncle vernon furiously but dumbledore raised his finger for silence a silence which fell a though he had struck uncle vernon dumb the magic i evoked fifteen year ago mean that harry ha powerful protection while he can still call this house home however miserable he ha been here however unwelcome however badly treated you have at least grudgingly allowed him houseroom this magic will cease to operate the moment that harry turn seventeen in other word at the moment he becomes a man i ask only this that you allow harry to return once more to this house before his seventeenth birthday which will ensure that the protection continues until that time none of the dursleys said anything dudley wa frowning slightly a though he wa still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated uncle vernon looked a though he had something stuck in his throat aunt petunia however wa oddly flushed well harry time for u to be off said dumbledore at last standing up and straightening his long black cloak until we meet again he said to the dursleys who looked a though that moment could wait forever page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling a far a they were concerned and after doffing his hat he swept from the room bye said harry hastily to the dursleys and followed dumbledore who paused beside harrys trunk upon which hedwigs cage wa perched we do not want to be encumbered by these just now he said pulling out his wand again i shall send them to the burrow to await u there however i would like you to bring your invisibility cloak just in case harry extracted his cloak from his trunk with some difficulty trying not to show dumbledore the mess within when he had stuffed it into an inside pocket of his jacket dumbledore waved his wand and the trunk cage and hedwig vanished dumbledore then waved his wand again and the front door opened onto cool misty darkness and now harry let u step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress adventure page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling horace slughorn despite the fact that he had spent every waking moment of the past few day hoping desperately that dumbledore would indeed come to fetch him harry felt distinctly awkward a they set off down privet drive together he had never had a proper conversation with the headmaster outside of hogwarts before there wa usually a desk between them the memory of their last facetoface encounter kept intruding too and it rather heightened harrys sense of embarrassment he had shouted a lot on that occasion not to mention done his best to smash several of dumbledore s most prized possession dumbledore however seemed completely relaxed keep your wand at the ready harry he said brightly but i thought i am not allowed to use magic outside school sir page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling if there is an attack said dumbledore i give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you however i do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight why not sir you are with me said dumbledore simply this will do harry he came to an abrupt halt at the end of privet drive you have not of course passed your apparition test he said no said harry i thought you had to be seventeen you do said dumbledore so you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly my left if you do not mind a you have noticed my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment harry gripped dumbledores proffered forearm very good said dumbledore well here we go harry felt dumbledores arm twist away from him and redoubled his grip the next thing he knew everything went black he wa being pressed very hard from all direction he could not breathe there were iron band tightening around his chest his eyeball were being forced back into his head his eardrum were being pushed deeper into his skull and then he gulped great lungfuls of cold night air and opened his streaming eye he felt a though he had just been forced through a very tight rubber tube it wa a few second before he realized that privet drive had vanished he and dumbledore were now standing in page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what appeared to be a deserted village square in the center of which stood an old war memorial and a few bench his comprehension catching up with his sens harry realized that he had just apparated for the first time in his life are you all right asked dumbledore looking down at him solicitously the sensation doe take some getting used to i am fine said harry rubbing his ear which felt a though they had left privet drive rather reluctantly but i think i might prefer broom dumbledore smiled drew his traveling cloak a little more tightly around his neck and said this way he set off at a brisk pace past an empty inn and a few house according to a clock on a nearby church it wa almost midnight so tell me harry said dumbledore your scar ha it been hurting at all harry raised a hand unconsciously to his forehead and rubbed the lightningshaped mark no he said and i have been wondering about that i thought it would be burning all the time now voldemorts getting so powerful again he glanced up at dumbledore and saw that he wa wearing a satisfied expression i on the other hand thought otherwise said dumbledore lord voldemort ha finally realized the dangerous access to his thought and feeling you have been enjoying it appears that he is now employing occlumency against you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well i am not complaining said harry who missed neither the disturbing dream nor the startling flash of insight into voldemorts mind they turned a corner passing a telephone box and a bus shelter harry looked sideways at dumbledore again professor harry er where exactly are we this harry is the charming village of budleigh babberton and what are we doing here ah yes of course i have not told you said dumbledore well i have lost count of the number of time i have said this in recent year but we are once again one member of staff short we are here to persuade an old colleague of mine to come out of retirement and return to hogwarts how can i help with that sir oh i think well find a use for you said dumbledore vaguely left here harry they proceeded up a steep narrow street lined with house all the window were dark the odd chill that had lain over privet drive for two week persisted here too thinking of dementors harry cast a look over his shoulder and grasped his wand reassuringly in his pocket professor why could not we just apparate directly into your old colleague house page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling because it would be quite a rude a kicking down the front door said dumbledore courtesy dictate that we offer fellow wizard the opportunity of denying u entry in any case most wizarding dwelling are magically protected from unwanted apparators at hogwarts for instance you can not apparate anywhere inside the building or ground said harry quickly hermione granger told me and she is quite right we turn left again the church clock chimed midnight behind them harry wondered why dumbledore did not consider it rude to call on his old colleague so late but now that conversation had been established he had more pressing question to ask sir i saw in the daily prophet that fudge ha been sacked correct said dumbledore now turning up a steep side street he ha been replaced a i am sure you also saw by rufus scrimgeour who used to be head of the auror office is he do you think he good asked harry an interesting question said dumbledore he is able certainly a more decisive and forceful personality than cornelius yes but i meant i know what you meant rufus is a man of action and having fought dark wizard for most of his working life doe not underestimate lord voldemort page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry waited but dumbledore did not say anything about the disagreement with scrimgeour that the daily prophet had reported and he did not have the nerve to pursue the subject so he changed it and sir i saw about madam bone yes said dumbledore quietly a terrible loss she wa a great witch just up here i think ouch he had pointed with his injured hand professor what happened to your i have no time to explain now said dumbledore it is a thrilling tale i wish to do it justice he smiled at harry who understood that he wa not being snubbed and that he had permission to keep asking question sir i got a ministry of magic leaflet by owl about security measure we should all take against the death eater yes i received one myself said dumbledore still smiling did you find it useful not really no i thought not you have not asked me for instance what is my favorite flavor of jam to check that i am indeed professor dumbledore and not an impostor i did not harry began not entirely sure whether he wa being reprimanded or not for future reference harry it is raspberry although of course if i were a death eater i would page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling have been sure to research my own jam preference before impersonating myself er right said harry well on that leaflet it said something about inferi what exactly are they the leaflet wa not very clear they are corps said dumbledore calmly dead body that have been bewitched to do a dark wizard bidding inferi have not been seen for a long time however not since voldemort wa last powerful he killed enough people to make an army of them of course this is the place harry just here they were nearing a small neat stone house set in it own garden harry wa too busy digesting the horrible idea of inferi to have much attention left for anything else but a they reached the front gate dumbledore stopped dead and harry walked into him oh dear oh dear dear dear harry followed his gaze up the carefully tended front path and felt his heart sink the front door wa hanging off it hinge dumbledore glanced up and down the street it seemed quite deserted wand out and follow me harry he said quietly he opened the gate and walked swiftly and silently up the garden path harry at his heel then pushed the front door very slowly his wand raised and at the ready lumos page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore s wand tip ignited casting it light up a narrow hallway to the left another door stood open holding his illuminated wand aloft dumbledore walked into the sitting room with harry right behind him a scene of total devastation met their eye a grandfather clock lay splintered at their foot it face cracked it pendulum lying a little farther away like a dropped sword a piano wa on it side it key strewn across the floor the wreckage of a fallen chandelier glittered nearby cushion lay deflated feather oozing from slash in their side fragment of glass and china lay like powder over everything dumbledore raised his wand even higher so that it light wa thrown upon the wall where something darkly red and glutinous wa spattered over the wallpaper harrys small intake of breath made dumbledore look around not pretty is it he said heavily yes something horrible ha happened here dumbledore moved carefully into the middle of the room scrutinizing the wreckage at his foot harry followed gazing around halfscared of what he might see hidden behind the wreck of the piano or the overturned sofa but there wa no sign of a body maybe there wa a fight and and they dragged him off professor harry suggested trying not to imagine how badly wounded a man would have to be to leave those stain spattered halfway up the wall i do not think so said dumbledore quietly peering behind an overstuffed armchair lying on it side you mean he page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling still here somewhere yes and without warning dumbledore swooped plunging the tip of his wand into the seat of the overstuffed armchair which yelled ouch good evening horace said dumbledore straightening up again harrys jaw dropped where a split second before there had been an armchair there now crouched an enormously fat bald old man who wa massaging his lower belly and squinting up at dumbledore with an aggrieved and watery eye there wa no need to stick the wand in that hard he said gruffly clambering to his foot it hurt the wandlight sparkled on his shiny pate his prominent eye his enormous silver walruslike mustache and the highly polished button on the maroon velvet jacket he wa wearing over a pair of lilac silk pajama the top of his head barely reached dumbledore s chin what gave it away he grunted a he staggered to his foot still rubbing his lower belly he seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair my dear horace said dumbledore looking amused if the death eater really had come to call the dark mark would have been set over the house the wizard clapped a pudgy hand to his vast forehead the dark mark he muttered knew there wa something ah well would not have had time page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling anyway id only just put the finishing touch to my upholstery when you entered the room he heaved a great sigh that made the end of his mustache flutter would you like my assistance clearing up asked dumbledore politely please said the other they stood back to back the tall thin wizard and the short round one and waved their wand in one identical sweeping motion the furniture flew back to it original place ornament reformed in midair feather zoomed into their cushion torn book repaired themselves a they landed upon their shelf oil lantern soared onto side table and reignited a vast collection of splintered silver picture frame flew glittering across the room and alighted whole and untarnished upon a desk rip crack and hole healed everywhere and the wall wiped themselves clean what kind of blood wa that incidentally asked dumbledore loudly over the chiming of the newly unsmashed grandfather clock on the wall dragon shouted the wizard called horace a with a deafening grinding and tinkling the chandelier screwed itself back into the ceiling there wa a final plunk from the piano and silence yes dragon repeated the wizard conversationally my last bottle and price are skyhigh at the moment still it might be reusable page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he stumped over to a small crystal bottle standing on top of a sideboard and held it up to the light examining the thick liquid within hmm bit dusty he set the bottle back on the sideboard and sighed it wa then that his gaze fell upon harry oho he said his large round eye flying to harrys forehead and the lightningshaped scar it bore ohol this said dumbledore moving forward to make the introduction is harry potter harry this is an old friend and colleague of mine horace slughorn slughorn turned on dumbledore his expression shrewd so that is how you thought you would persuade me is it well the answer no albus he pushed past harry his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation i suppose we can have a drink at least asked dumbledore for old time sake slughorn hesitated all right then one drink he said ungraciously dumbledore smiled at harry and directed him toward a chair not unlike the one that slughorn had so recently impersonated which stood right beside the newly burning fire and a brightly glowing oil lamp harry took the seat with the distinct impression that dumbledore for some reason wanted to keep him a visible a possible certainly when slughorn who had been busy with decanter and glass turned to face the room again his eye fell immediately upon harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hmpf he said looking away quickly a though frightened of hurting his eye here he gave a drink to dumbledore who had sat down without invitation thrust the tray at harry and then sank into the cushion of the repaired sofa and a disgruntled silence his leg were so short they did not touch the floor well how have you been keeping horace dumbledore asked not so well said slughorn at once weak chest wheezy rheumatism too can not move like i used to well that is to be expected old age fatigue and yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for u at such short notice said dumbledore you can not have had more than three minute warning slughorn said half irritably half proudly two did not hear my intruder charm go off i wa taking a bath still he added sternly seeming to pull himself back together again the fact remains that i am an old man albus a tired old man who is earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comfort he certainly had those thought harry looking around the room it wa stuffy and cluttered yet nobody could say it wa uncomfortable there were soft chair and footstool drink and book box of chocolate and plump cushion if harry had not known who lived there he would have guessed at a rich fussy old lady you are not yet a old a i am horace said dumbledore page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself said slughorn bluntly his pale gooseberry eye had found dumbledore s injured hand reaction not what they were i see you are quite right said dumbledore serenely shaking back his sleeve to reveal the tip of those burned and blackened finger the sight of them made the back of harrys neck prickle unpleasantly i am undoubtedly slower than i wa but on the other hand he shrugged and spread his hand wide a though to say that age had it compensation and harry noticed a ring on his uninjured hand that he had never seen dumbledore wear before it wa large rather clumsily made of what looked like gold and wa set with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle slughorns eye lingered for a moment on the ring too and harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead so all these precaution against intruder horace are they for the death eater benefit or mine asked dumbledore what would the death eater want with a poor brokendown old buffer like me demanded slughorn i imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talent to coercion torture and murder said dumbledore are you really telling me that they have not come recruiting yet slughorn eyed dumbledore balefully for a moment then muttered i have not given them the chance i have been on the move for a year never stay in one place more than a week move from muggle house to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling muggle house the owner of this place are on holiday in the canary island it been very pleasant ill be sorry to leave it quite easy once you know how one simple freezing charm on these absurd burglar alarm they use instead of sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbor do not spot you bringing in the piano ingenious said dumbledore but it sound a rather tiring existence for a brokendown old buffer in search of a quiet life now if you were to return to hogwarts if you are going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school you can save your breath albus i might have been in hiding but some funny rumor have reached me since dolores umbridge left if that is how you treat teacher these day professor umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd said dumbledore i think you horace would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaur filthy halfbreeds that is what she did did she said slughorn idiotic woman never liked her harry chuckled and both dumbledore and slughorn looked round at him sorry harry said hastily it just i did not like her either dumbledore stood up rather suddenly are you leaving asked slughorn at once looking hopeful page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no i wa wondering whether i might use your bathroom said dumbledore oh said slughorn clearly disappointed second on the left down the hall dumbledore strode from the room once the door had closed behind him there wa silence after a few moment slughorn got to his foot but seemed uncertain what to do with himself he shot a furtive look at harry then crossed to the fire and turned his back on it warming his wide behind do not think i do not know why he brought you he said abruptly harry merely looked at slughorn slughorn s watery eye slid over harrys scar this time taking in the rest of his face you look very like your father yeah i have been told said harry except for your eye you have got my mother eye yeah harry had heard it so often he found it a bit wearing hmpf yes well you should not have favorite a a teacher of course but she wa one of mine your mother slughorn added in answer to harrys questioning look lily evans one of the brightest i ever taught vivacious you know charming girl i used to tell her she ought to have been in my house very cheeky answer i used to get back too which wa your house page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i wa head of slytherin said slughorn oh now he went on quickly seeing the expression on harrys face and wagging a stubby finger at him do not go holding that against me you will be gryffindor like her i suppose yes it usually go in family not always though ever heard of sirius black you must have done been in the paper for the last couple of year died a few week ago it wa a though an invisible hand had twisted harrys intestine and held them tight well anyway he wa a big pal of your father at school the whole black family had been in my house but sirius ended up in gryffindor shame he wa a talented boy i got his brother regulus when he came along but id have liked the set he sounded like an enthusiastic collector who had been outbid at auction apparently lost in memory he gazed at the opposite wall turning idly on the spot to ensure an even heat on his backside your mother wa muggleborn of course could not believe it when i found out thought she must have been pureblood she wa so good one of my best friend is muggleborn said harry and she is the best in our year funny how that sometimes happens is not it said slughorn not really said harry coldly slughorn looked down at him in surprise you must not think i am prejudiced he said no no no have not i just said your mother wa one of my alltime favorite student and there wa dirk cresswell in page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the year after her too now head of the goblin liaison office of course another muggleborn a very gifted student and still give me excellent inside information on the goingson at gringotts he bounced up and down a little smiling in a self satisfied way and pointed at the many glittering photograph frame on the dresser each peopled with tiny moving occupant all exstudents all signed you will notice barnabas cuffe editor of the daily prophet he always interested to hear my take on the day news and ambrosius flume of honeydukes a hamper every birthday and all because i wa able to give him an introduction to ciceron harkiss who gave him his first job and at the back you will see her if you just crane your neck that is gwenog jones who of course captain the holyhead harpy people are always astonished to hear i am on firstname term with the harpy and free ticket whenever i want them this thought seemed to cheer him up enormously and all these people know where to find you to send you stuff asked harry who could not help wondering why the death eater had not yet tracked down slughorn if hamper of sweet quidditch ticket and visitor craving his advice and opinion could find him the smile slid from slughorn s face a quickly a the blood from his wall of course not he said looking down at harry i have been out of touch with everybody for a year page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry had the impression that the word shocked slughorn himself he looked quite unsettled for a moment then he shrugged still the prudent wizard keep his head down in such time all very well for dumbledore to talk but taking up a post at hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the order of the phoenix and while i am sure they are very admirable and brave and all the rest of it i do not personally fancy the mortality rate you do not have to join the order to teach at hogwarts said harry who could not quite keep a note of derision out of his voice it wa hard to sympathize with slughorn s cosseted existence when he remembered sirius crouching in a cave and living on rat most of the teacher are not in it and none of them ha ever been killed well unless you count quirrell and he got what he deserved seeing a he wa working with voldemort harry had been sure slughorn would be one of those wizard who could not bear to hear voldemorts name spoken aloud and wa not disappointed slughorn gave a shudder and a squawk of protest which harry ignored i reckon the staff are safer than most people while dumbledore s headmaster he supposed to be the only one voldemort ever feared is not he harry went on slughorn gazed into space for a moment or two he seemed to be thinking over harrys word well yes it is true that hewhomustnotbenamed ha never sought a fight with dumbledore he muttered grudgingly and i suppose one could argue page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that a i have not joined the death eater hewho mustnotbenamed can hardly count me a friend in which case i might well be safer a little closer to albus i can not pretend that amelia bones death did not shake me if she with all her ministry contact and protection dumbledore reentered the room and slughorn jumped a though he had forgotten he wa in the house oh there you are albus he said you have been a very long time upset stomach no i wa merely reading the muggle magazine said dumbledore i do love knitting pattern well harry we have trespassed upon horace hospitality quite long enough i think it is time for u to leave not at all reluctant to obey harry jumped to his foot slughorn seemed taken aback you are leaving yes indeed i think i know a lost because when i see one lost slughorn seemed agitated he twiddled his fat thumb and fidgeted a he watched dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak and harry zip up his jacket well i am sorry you do not want the job horace said dumbledore raising his uninjured hand in a farewell salute hogwarts would have been glad to see you back again our greatly increased security notwithstanding you will always be welcome to visit should you wish to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yes well very gracious a i say goodbye then bye said harry they were at the front door when there wa a shout from behind them all right all right do it dumbledore turned to see slughorn standing breathless in the doorway to the sitting room you will come out of retirement yes yes said slughorn impatiently i must be mad but yes wonderful said dumbledore beaming then horace we shall see you on the first of september yes i daresay you will grunted slughorn a they set off down the garden path slughorn s voice floated after them want a pay rise dumbledore dumbledore chuckled the garden gate swung shut behind them and they set off back down the hill through the dark and the swirling mist well done harry said dumbledore i did not do anything said harry in surprise oh yes you did you showed horace exactly how much he stand to gain by returning to hogwarts did you like him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling er harry wa not sure whether he liked slughorn or not he supposed he had been pleasant in his way but he had also seemed vain and whatever he said to the contrary much too surprised that a muggleborn should make a good witch horace said dumbledore relieving harry of the responsibility to say any of this like his comfort he also like the company of the famous the successful and the powerful he enjoys the feeling that he influence these people he ha never wanted to occupy the throne himself he prefers the backseat more room to spread out you see he used to handpick favorite at hogwarts sometimes for their ambition or their brain sometimes for their charm or their talent and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various field horace formed a kind of club of his favorite with himself at the center making introduction forging useful contact between member and always reaping some kind of benefit in return whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the goblin liaison office harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider spinning a web around it twitching a thread here and there to bring it large and juicy fly a little closer i tell you all this dumbledore continued not to turn you against horace or a we must now call him professor slughorn but to put you on your guard he will undoubtedly try to collect you harry you would be the jewel of his collection the boy who lived or a they call you these day the chosen one page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling at these word a chill that had nothing to do with the surrounding mist stole over harry he wa reminded of word he had heard a few week ago word that had a horrible and particular meaning to him neither can live while the other survives dumbledore had stopped walking level with the church they had passed earlier this will do harry if you will grasp my arm braced this time harry wa ready for the apparition but still found it unpleasant when the pressure disappeared and he found himself able to breathe again he wa standing in a country lane beside dumbledore and looking ahead to the crooked silhouette of his second favorite building in the world the burrow in spite of the feeling of dread that had just swept through him his spirit could not help but lift at the sight of it ron wa in there and so wa mr weasley who could cook better than anyone he knew if you do not mind harry said dumbledore a they passed through the gate id like a few word with you before we part in private perhaps in here dumbledore pointed toward a rundown stone outhouse where the weasleys kept their broomstick a little puzzled harry followed dumbledore through the creaking door into a space a little smaller than the average cupboard dumbledore illuminated the tip of his wand so that it glowed like a torch and smiled down at harry i hope you will forgive me for mentioning it harry but i am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the ministry permit me to say that i think sirius would have been proud of you harry swallowed his voice seemed to have deserted him he did not think he could stand to discus sirius it had been painful enough to hear uncle vernon say his godfather dead and even worse to hear sirius name thrown out casually by slughorn it wa cruel said dumbledore softly that you and sirius had such a short time together a brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship harry nodded his eye fixed resolutely on the spider now climbing dumbledores hat he could tell that dumbledore understood that he might even suspect that until his letter arrived harry had spent nearly all his time at the dursleys lying on his bed refusing meal and staring at the misted window full of the chill emptiness that he had come to associate with dementors it just hard harry said finally in a low voice to realize he will not write to me again his eye burned suddenly and he blinked he felt stupid for admitting it but the fact that he had had someone outside hogwarts who cared what happened to him almost like a parent had been one of the best thing about discovering his godfather and now the post owl would never bring him that comfort again sirius represented much to you that you had never known before said dumbledore gently naturally the loss is devastating page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but while i wa at the dursleys interrupted harry his voice growing stronger i realized i can not shut myself away or or crack up sirius would not have wanted that would he and anyway life too short look at madam bone look at emmeline vance it could be me next could not it but if it is he said fiercely now looking straight into dumbledores blue eye gleaming in the wandlight ill make sure i take a many death eater with me a i can and voldemort too if i can manage it spoken both like your mother and father son and sirius true godson said dumbledore with an approving pat on harrys back i take my hat off to you or i would if i were not afraid of showering you in spider and now harry on a closely related subject i gather that you have been taking the daily prophet over the last two week yes said harry and his heart beat a little faster then you will have seen that there have been not so much leak a flood concerning your adventure in the hall of prophecy yes said harry again and now everyone know that i am the one no they do not interrupted dumbledore there are only two people in the whole world who know the full content of the prophecy made about you and lord voldemort and they are both standing in this smelly spidery broom she would it is true however that many have guessed correctly that voldemort sent his death eater to steal a prophecy and that the prophecy concerned you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling now i think i am correct in saying that you have not told anybody that you know what the prophecy said no said harry a wise decision on the whole said dumbledore although i think you ought to relax it in favor of your friend mr ronald weasley and miss hermione granger yes he continued when harry looked startled i think they ought to know you do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them i did not want to worry or frighten them said dumbledore surveying harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacle or perhaps to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened you need your friend harry a you so rightly said sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away harry said nothing but dumbledore did not seem to require an answer he continued on a different though related subject it is my wish that you take private lesson with me this year private with you said harry surprised out of his preoccupied silence yes i think it is time that i took a greater hand in your education what will you be teaching me sir oh a little of this a little of that said dumbledore airily page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry waited hopefully but dumbledore did not elaborate so he asked something else that had been bothering him slightly if i am having lesson with you i will not have to do occlumency lesson with snape will i professor snape harry and no you will not good said harry in relief because they were a he stopped careful not to say what he really thought i think the word fiasco would be a good one here said dumbledore nodding harry laughed well that mean i will not see much of professor snape from now on he said because he will not let me carry on potion unless i get outstanding in my owl which i know i have not do not count your owl before they are delivered said dumbledore gravely which now i think of it ought to be some time later today now two more thing harry before we part firstly i wish you to keep your invisibility cloak with you at all time from this moment onward even within hogwarts itself just in case you understand me harry nodded and lastly while you stay here the burrow ha been given the highest security the ministry of magic can provide these measure have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to arthur and molly all page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling their post for instance is being searched at the ministry before being sent on they do not mind in the slightest for their only concern is your safety however it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them i understand said harry quickly very well then said dumbledore pushing open the broom she would door and stepping out into the yard i see a light in the kitchen let u not deprive molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling an excess of phlegm harry and dumbledore approached the back door of the burrow which wa surrounded by the familiar litter of old wellington boot and rusty cauldron harry could hear the soft clucking of sleepy chicken coming from a distant she would dumbledore knocked three time and harry saw sudden movement behind the kitchen window who is there said a nervous voice he recognized a mr weasleys declare yourself it is i dumbledore bringing harry the door opened at once there stood mr weasley short plump and wearing an old green dressing gown harry dear gracious albus you gave me a fright you said not to expect you before morning we were lucky said dumbledore ushering harry over the threshold slughorn proved much more page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling persuadable than i had expected harrys doing of course ah hello nymphadora harry looked around and saw that mr weasley wa not alone despite the lateness of the hour a young witch with a pale heartshaped face and mousy brown hair wa sitting at the table clutching a large mug between her hand hello professor she said wotcher harry hi tonks harry thought she looked drawn even ill and there wa something forced in her smile certainly her appearance wa le colorful than usual without her customary shade of bubblegumpink hair id better be off she said quickly standing up and pulling her cloak around her shoulder thanks for the tea and sympathy molly please do not leave on my account said dumbledore courteously i can not stay i have urgent matter to discus with rufus scrimgeour no no i need to get going said tonks not meeting dumbledores eye night dear why not come to dinner at the weekend remus and madeye are coming no really molly thanks anyway good night everyone tonks hurried past dumbledore and harry into the yard a few pace beyond the doorstep she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air harry noticed that mr weasley looked troubled page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well i shall see you at hogwarts harry said dumbledore take care of yourself molly your servant he made mr weasley a bow and followed tonks vanishing at precisely the same spot mr weasley closed the door on the empty yard and then steered harry by the shoulder into the full glow of the lantern on the table to examine his appearance you are like ron she sighed looking him up and down both of you look a though you have had stretching jinx put on you i swear ron grown four inch since i last bought him school robe are you hungry harry yeah i am said harry suddenly realizing just how hungry he wa sit down dear ill knock something up a harry sat down a furry ginger cat with a squashed face jumped onto his knee and settled there purring so hermiones here he asked happily a he tickled crookshanks behind the ear oh yes she arrived the day before yesterday said mr weasley rapping a large iron pot with her wand it bounced onto the stove with a loud clang and began to bubble at once everyone is in bed of course we did not expect you for hour here you are she tapped the pot again it rose into the air flew toward harry and tipped over mr weasley slid a bowl neatly beneath it just in time to catch the stream of thick steaming onion soup page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling bread dear thanks mr weasley she waved her wand over her shoulder a loaf of bread and a knife soared gracefully onto the table a the loaf sliced itself and the soup pot dropped back onto the stove mr weasley sat down opposite him so you persuaded horace slughorn to take the job harry nodded his mouth so full of hot soup that he could not speak he taught arthur and me said mr weasley he wa at hogwarts for age started around the same time a dumbledore i think did you like him his mouth now full of bread harry shrugged and gave a noncommittal jerk of the head i know what you mean said mr weasley nodding wisely of course he can be charming when he want to be but arthur never liked him much the ministry littered with slughorns old favorite he wa always good at giving leg ups but he never had much time for arthur did not seem to think he wa enough of a highflier well that just show you even slughorn make mistake i do not know whether ron told you in any of his letter it only just happened but arthur been promoted it could not have been clearer that mr weasley had been bursting to say this harry swallowed a large amount of very hot soup and thought he could feel his throat blistering that is great he gasped page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you are sweet beamed mr weasley possibly taking his watering eye for emotion at the news yes rufus scrimgeour ha set up several new office in response to the present situation and arthur heading the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spell and protective object it a big job he got ten people reporting to him now what exactly well you see in all the panic about youknowwho odd thing have been cropping up for sale everywhere thing that are supposed to guard against youknowwho and the death eater you can imagine the kind of thing socalled protective potion that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pu added or instruction for defensive jinx that actually make your ear fall off well in the main the perpetrator are just people like mundungus fletcher who have never done an honest day work in their life and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is but every now and then something really nasty turn up the other day arthur confiscated a box of cursed sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a death eater so you see it a very important job and i tell him it just silly to miss dealing with spark plug and toaster and all the rest of that muggle rubbish mr weasley ended her speech with a stern look a if it had been harry suggesting that it wa natural to miss spark plug is mr weasley still at work harry asked yes he is a a matter of fact he a tiny bit late he said he would be back around midnight page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she turned to look at a large clock that wa perched awkwardly on top of a pile of sheet in the washing basket at the end of the table harry recognized it at once it had nine hand each inscribed with the name of a family member and usually hung on the weasleys sitting room wall though it current position suggested that mr weasley had taken to carrying it around the house with her every single one of it nine hand wa now pointing at mortal peril it been like that for a while now said mr weasley in an unconvincingly casual voice ever since youknowwho came back into the open i suppose everybodys in mortal danger now i do not think it can be just our family but i do not know anyone else who is got a clock like this so i can not check oh with a sudden exclamation she pointed at the clock face mr weasleys hand had switched to traveling he coming and sure enough a moment later there wa a knock on the back door mr weasley jumped up and hurried to it with one hand on the doorknob and her face pressed against the wood she called softly arthur is that you yes came mr weasleys weary voice but i would say that even if i were a death eater dear ask the question oh honestly molly all right all right what is your dearest ambition page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling to find out how airplane stay up mr weasley nodded and turned the doorknob but apparently mr weasley wa holding tight to it on the other side because the door remained firmly shut molly i have got to ask you your question first arthur really this is just silly what do you like me to call you when were alone together even by the dim light of the lantern harry could tell that mr weasley had turned bright red he himself felt suddenly warm around the ear and neck and hastily gulped soup clattering his spoon a loudly a he could against the bowl mollywobbles whispered a mortified mr weasley into the crack at the edge of the door correct said mr weasley now you can let me in mr weasley opened the door to reveal her husband a thin balding redhaired wizard wearing horn rimmed spectacle and a long and dusty traveling cloak i still do not see why we have to go through that every time you come home said mr weasley still pink in the face a she helped her husband out of his cloak i mean a death eater might have forced the answer out of you before impersonating you i know dear but it ministry procedure and i have to set an example something smell good onion soup page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling mr weasley turned hopefully in the direction of the table harry we did not expect you until morning they shook hand and mr weasley dropped into the chair beside harry a mr weasley set a bowl of soup in front of him too thanks molly it been a tough night some idiot started selling metamorphmedals just sling them around your neck and you will be able to change your appearance at will a hundred thousand disguise all for ten galleon and what really happens when you put them on mostly you just turn a fairly unpleasant orange color but a couple of people have also sprouted tentaclelike wart all over their body a if st mungos did not have enough to do already it sound like the sort of thing fred and george would find funny said mr weasley hesitantly are you sure of course i am said mr weasley the boy would not do anything like that now not when people are desperate for protection so is that why you are late metamorphmedals no we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in elephant and castle but luckily the magical law enforcement squad had sorted it out by the time we got there harry stifled a yawn behind his hand page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling bed said an undeceived mr weasley at once i have got fred and george room all ready for you you will have it to yourself why where are they oh they are in diagon alley sleeping in the little flat over their joke shop a they are so busy said mr weasley i must say i did not approve at first but they do seem to have a bit of a flair for business come on dear your trunk already up there night mr weasley said harry pushing back his chair crookshanks leapt lightly from his lap and slunk out of the room gnight harry said mr weasley harry saw mr weasley glance at the clock in the washing basket a they left the kitchen all the hand were once again at mortal peril fred and george bedroom wa on the second floor mr weasley pointed her wand at a lamp on the bedside table and it ignited at once bathing the room in a pleasant golden glow though a large vase of flower had been placed on a desk in front of the small window their perfume could not disguise the lingering smell of what harry thought wa gunpowder a considerable amount of floor space wa devoted to a vast number of unmarked sealed cardboard box amongst which stood harrys school trunk the room looked a though it wa being used a a temporary warehouse hedwig hooted happily at harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe then took off through the window harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting harry bade mr weasley good page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling night put on pajama and got into one of the bed there wa something hard inside the pillowcase he groped inside it and pulled out a sticky purpleand orange sweet which he recognized a a puking pastille smiling to himself he rolled over and wa instantly asleep second later or so it seemed to harry he wa awakened by what sounded like cannon fire a the door burst open sitting bolt upright he heard the rasp of the curtain being pulled back the dazzling sunlight seemed to poke him hard in both eye shielding them with one hand he groped hopelessly for his glass with the other wuzzgoinon we did not know you were here already said a loud and excited voice and he received a sharp blow to the top of the head ron do not hit him said a girl voice reproachfully harrys hand found his glass and he shoved them on though the light wa so bright he could hardly see anyway a long looming shadow quivered in front of him for a moment he blinked and ron weasley came into focus grinning down at him all right never been better said harry rubbing the top of his head and slumping back onto his pillow you not bad said ron pulling over a cardboard box and sitting on it when did you get here mum only just told u about one of the clock this morning page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling were the muggles all right did they treat you okay same a usual said harry a hermione perched herself on the edge of his bed they did not talk to me much but i like it better that way how are you hermione oh i am fine said hermione who wa scrutinizing harry a though he wa sickening for something he thought he knew what wa behind this and a he had no wish to discus sirius death or any other miserable subject at the moment he said what is the time have i missed breakfast do not worry about that mum bringing you up a tray she reckons you look underfed said ron rolling his eye so what is been going on nothing much i have just been stuck at my aunt and uncle have not i come off it said ron you have been off with dumbledore it wa not that exciting he just wanted me to help him persuade this old teacher to come out of retirement his name horace slughorn oh said ron looking disappointed we thought hermione flashed a warning look at ron and ron changed tack at top speed we thought it would be something like that you did said harry amused page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yeah yeah now umbridge ha left obviously we need a new defense against the dark art teacher do not we so er what is he like he look a bit like a walrus and he used to be head of slytherin said harry something wrong hermione she wa watching him a though expecting strange symptom to manifest themselves at any moment she rearranged her feature hastily in an unconvincing smile no of course not so um did slughorn seem like hell be a good teacher do not know said harry he can not be worse than umbridge can he i know someone who is worse than umbridge said a voice from the doorway ron younger sister slouched into the room looking irritable hi harry what is up with you ron asked it her said ginny plonking herself down on harrys bed she is driving me mad what is she done now asked hermione sympathetically it the way she talk to me you would think i wa about three i know said hermione dropping her voice she is so full of herself harry wa astonished to hear hermione talking about mr weasley like this and could not blame ron for page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling saying angrily can not you two lay off her for five second oh that is right defend her snapped ginny we all know you can not get enough of her this seemed an odd comment to make about ron mother starting to feel that he wa missing something harry said who are you but his question wa answered before he could finish it the bedroom door flew open again and harry instinctively yanked the bedcover up to his chin so hard that hermione and ginny slid off the bed onto the floor a young woman wa standing in the doorway a woman of such breathtaking beauty that the room seemed to have become strangely airless she wa tall and willowy with long blonde hair and appeared to emanate a faint silvery glow to complete this vision of perfection she wa carrying a heavily laden breakfast tray arry she said in a throaty voice eet a been too long a she swept over the threshold toward him mr weasley wa revealed bobbing along in her wake looking rather cross there wa no need to bring up the tray i wa just about to do it myself eet wa no trouble said fleur delacour setting the tray across harrys knee and then swooping to kiss him on each cheek he felt the place where her mouth had touched him burn i ave been longing to see i am you remember my seester gabrielle she page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling never stop talking about ariy potter she will be delighted to see you again oh is she here too harry croaked no no silly boy said fleur with a tinkling laugh i mean next summer when we but do you not know her great blue eye widened and she looked reproachfully at mr weasley who said we had not got around to telling him yet fleur turned back to harry swinging her silvery sheet of hair so that it whipped mr weasley across the face bill and i are going to be married oh said harry blankly he could not help noticing how mr weasley hermione and ginny were all determinedly avoiding one anothers gaze wow er congratulation she swooped down upon him and kissed him again bill is very busy at ze moment working very ard and i only work parttime at gringotts for my eenglish so he brought me ere for a few day to get to know is family properly i wa so pleased to ear you would be coming zere is not much to do ere unless you like cooking and chicken well enjoy your breakfast arry with these word she turned gracefully and seemed to float out of the room closing the door quietly behind her mr weasley made a noise that sounded like tchah page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling mum hate her said ginny quietly i do not hate her said mr weasley in a cross whisper i just think they have hurried into this engagement that is all they have known each other a year said ron who looked oddly groggy and wa staring at the closed door well that is not very long i know why it happened of course it all this uncertainty with youknowwho coming back people think they might be dead tomorrow so they are rushing all sort of decision they would normally take time over it wa the same last time he wa powerful people eloping left right and center including you and dad said ginny slyly yes well your father and i were made for each other what wa the point in waiting said mr weasley whereas bill and fleur well what have they really got in common he a hardworking downto earth sort of person whereas she is a cow said ginny nodding but bill not that downtoearth he a cursebreaker is not he he like a bit of adventure a bit of glamour i expect that is why he gone for phlegm stop calling her that ginny said mr weasley sharply a harry and hermione laughed well id better get on eat your egg while they are warm harry looking careworn she left the room ron still seemed slightly punchdrunk he wa shaking his head page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling experimentally like a dog trying to rid it ear of water do not you get used to her if she is staying in the same house harry asked well you do said ron but if she jump out at you unexpectedly like then it pathetic said hermione furiously striding away from ron a far a she could go and turning to face him with her arm folded once she had reached the wall you do not really want her around forever ginny asked ron incredulously when he merely shrugged she said well mum going to put a stop to it if she can i bet you anything how is she going to manage that asked harry she keep trying to get tonks round for dinner i think she is hoping bill will fall for tonks instead i hope he doe id much rather have her in the family yeah that will work said ron sarcastically listen no bloke in his right mind going to fancy tonks when fleurs around i mean tonks is okaylooking when she is not doing stupid thing to her hair and her nose but she is a damn sight nicer than phlegm said ginny and she is more intelligent she is an auror said hermione from the corner fleurs not stupid she wa good enough to enter the triwizard tournament said harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling not you a well said hermione bitterly i suppose you like the way phlegm say arry do you asked ginny scornfully no said harry wishing he had not spoken i wa just saying phlegm i mean fleur id much rather have tonks in the family said ginny at least she is a laugh she ha not been much of a laugh lately said ron every time i have seen her she is looked more like moaning myrtle that is not fair snapped hermione she still ha not got over what happened you know i mean he wa her cousin harrys heart sank they had arrived at sirius he picked up a fork and began shoveling scrambled egg into his mouth hoping to deflect any invitation to join in this part of the conversation tonks and sirius barely knew each other said ron sirius wa in azkaban half her life and before that their family never met that is not the point said hermione she think it wa her fault he died how doe she work that one out asked harry in spite of himself well she wa fighting bellatrix lestrange wa not she i think she feel that if only she had finished her off bellatrix could not have killed sirius that is stupid said ron page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it survivor guilt said hermione i know lupin tried to talk her round but she is still really down she is actually having trouble with her metamorphosing with her she can not change her appearance like she used to explained hermione i think her power must have been affected by shock or something i did not know that could happen said harry nor did i said hermione but i suppose if you are really depressed the door opened again and mr weasley popped her head in ginny she whispered come downstairs and help me with the lunch i am talking to this lot said ginny outraged now said mr weasley and withdrew she only want me there so she doe not have to be alone with phlegm said ginny crossly she swung her long red hair around in a very good imitation of fleur and pranced across the room with her arm held aloft like a ballerina you lot had better come down quickly too she said a she left harry took advantage of the temporary silence to eat more breakfast hermione wa peering into fred and george box though every now and then she cast sideways look at harry ron who wa now helping himself to harrys toast wa still gazing dreamily at the door page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what is this hermione asked eventually holding up what looked like a small telescope do not know said ron but if fred and georgeve left it here it probably not ready for the joke shop yet so be careful your mum said the shop going well said harry said fred and george have got a real flair for business that is an understatement said ron they are raking in the galleon i can not wait to see the place we have not been to diagon alley yet because mum say dad got to be there for extra security and he been really busy at work but it sound excellent and what about percy asked harry the third eldest weasley brother had fallen out with the rest of the family is he talking to your mum and dad again nope said ron but he know your dad wa right all along now about voldemort being back dumbledore say people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right said hermione i heard him telling your mum ron sound like the sort of mental thing dumbledore would say said ron he going to be giving me private lesson this year said harry conversationally ron choked on his bit of toast and hermione gasped page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you kept that quiet said ron i only just remembered said harry honestly he told me last night in your broom she would blimey private lesson with dumbledore said ron looking impressed i wonder why he his voice tailed away harry saw him and hermione exchange look harry laid down his knife and fork his heart beating rather fast considering that all he wa doing wa sitting in bed dumbledore had said to do it why not now he fixed his eye on his fork which wa gleaming in the sunlight streaming into his lap and said i do not know exactly why he going to be giving me lesson but i think it must be because of the prophecy neither ron nor hermione spoke harry had the impression that both had frozen he continued still speaking to his fork you know the one they were trying to steal at the ministry nobody know what it said though said hermione quickly it got smashed although the prophet say began ron but hermione said shh the prophet got it right said harry looking up at them both with a great effort hermione seemed frightened and ron amazed that glass ball that smashed wa not the only record of the prophecy i heard the whole thing in dumbledore s office he wa the one the prophecy wa made to so he could tell me from what it said harry took a deep breath it look like i am the one who is got to finish off voldemort at least it said neither of u could live while the other survives page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the three of them gazed at one another in silence for a moment then there wa a loud bang and hermione vanished behind a puff of black smoke hermione shouted harry and ron the breakfast tray slid to the floor with a crash hermione emerged coughing out of the smoke clutching the telescope and sporting a brilliantly purple black eye i squeezed it and it it punched me she gasped and sure enough they now saw a tiny fist on a long spring protruding from the end of the telescope do not worry said ron who wa plainly trying not to laugh mumll fix that she is good at healing minor injury oh well never mind that now said hermione hastily harry oh harry she sat down on the edge of his bed again we wondered after we got back from the ministry obviously we did not want to say anything to you but from what lucius malfoy said about the prophecy how it wa about you and voldemort well we thought it might be something like this oh harry she stared at him then whispered are you scared not a much a i wa said harry when i first heard it i wa but now it seems a though i always knew id have to face him in the end when we heard dumbledore wa collecting you in person we thought he might be telling you something page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling or showing you something to do with the prophecy said ron eagerly and we were kind of right were not we he would not be giving you lesson if he thought you were a goner would not waste his time he must think you have got a chance that is true said hermione i wonder what hell teach you harry really advanced defensive magic probably powerful countercurses antijinxes harry did not really listen a warmth wa spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving he knew that ron and hermione were more shocked than they were letting on but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him speaking bracing word of comfort not shrinking from him a though he were contaminated or dangerous wa worth more than he could ever tell them and evasive enchantment generally concluded hermione well at least you know one lesson you will be having this year that is one more than ron and me i wonder when our owl result will come can not be long now it been a month said ron hang on said harry a another part of last night conversation came back to him i think dumbledore said our owl result would be arriving today today shrieked hermione today but why did not you oh my god you should have said she leapt to her foot i am going to see whether any owl have come page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but when harry arrived downstairs ten minute later fully dressed and carrying his empty breakfast tray it wa to find hermione sitting at the kitchen table in great agitation while mr weasley tried to lessen her resemblance to half a panda it just will not budge mr weasley wa saying anxiously standing over hermione with her wand in her hand and a copy of the healer helpmate open at bruise cut and abrasion this ha always worked before i just can not understand it it will be fred and george idea of a funny joke making sure it can not come off said ginny but it got to come off squeaked hermione i can not go around looking like this forever you will not dear well find an antidote do not worry said mr weasley soothingly bill told me ow fred and george are very amusing said fleur smiling serenely yes i can hardly breathe for laughing snapped hermione she jumped up and started walking round and round the kitchen twisting her finger together mr weasley you are quite quite sure no owl have arrived this morning yes dear id have noticed said mr weasley patiently but it barely nine there is still plenty of time i know i messed up ancient rune muttered hermione feverishly i definitely made at least one page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling serious mistranslation and the defense against the dark art practical wa no good at all i thought transfiguration went all right at the time but looking back hermione will you shut up you are not the only one who is nervous barked ron and when you have got your eleven outstanding owl do not do not do not said hermione flapping her hand hysterically i know i have failed everything what happens if we fail harry asked the room at large but it wa again hermione who answered we discus our option with our head of house i asked professor mcgonagall at the end of last term harrys stomach squirmed he wished he had eaten le breakfast at beauxbatons said fleur complacently we ad a different way of doing thing i think eet wa better we sat our examination after six year of study not five and then fleurs word were drowned in a scream hermione wa pointing through the kitchen window three black speck were clearly visible in the sky growing larger all the time they are definitely owl said ron hoarsely jumping up to join hermione at the window and there are three of them said harry hastening to her other side one for each of u said hermione in a terrified whisper oh no oh no oh no page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she gripped both harry and ron tightly around the elbow the owl were flying directly at the burrow three handsome tawnies each of which it became clear a they flew lower over the path leading up to the house wa carrying a large square envelope oh no squealed hermione mr weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window one two three the owl soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line all three of them lifted their right leg harry moved forward the letter addressed to him wa tied to the leg of the owl in the middle he untied it with fumbling finger to his left ron wa trying to detach his own result to his right hermiones hand were shaking so much she wa making her whole owl tremble nobody in the kitchen spoke at last harry managed to detach the envelope he slit it open quickly and unfolded the parchment inside ordinary wizarding level result pas grade fail grade outstanding o poor p exceeds expectation e dreadful d acceptable a troll t harry james potter ha achieved astronomy a care of magical creature e page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling charm e defense against the dark artso divination p herbology e history of magic d potion e transfiguration e harry read the parchment through several time his breathing becoming easier with each reading it wa all right he had always known that he would fail divination and he had had no chance of passing history of magic given that he had collapsed halfway through the examination but he had passed everything else he ran his finger down the grade he had passed well in transfiguration and herbology he had even exceeded expectation at potion and best of all he had achieved outstanding at defense against the dark art he looked around hermione had her back to him and her head bent but ron wa looking delighted only failed divination and history of magic and who care about them he said happily to harry here swap harry glanced down ron grade there were no outstandings there knew you would be top at defense against the dark art said ron punching harry on the shoulder we have done all right have not we well done said mr weasley proudly ruffling ron hair seven owl that is more than fred and george got together page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hermione said ginny tentatively for hermione still had not turned around how did you do i not bad said hermione in a small voice oh come off it said ron striding over to her and whipping her result out of her hand yep nine outstandings and one exceeds expectation at defense against the dark art he looked down at her halfamused halfexasperated you are actually disappointed are not you hermione shook her head but harry laughed well were newt student now grinned ron mum are there any more sausage harry looked back down at his result they were a good a he could have hoped for he felt just one tiny twinge of regret this wa the end of his ambition to become an auror he had not secured the required potion grade he had known all along that he would not but he still felt a sinking in his stomach a he looked again at that small black e it wa odd really seeing that it had been a death eater in disguise who had first told harry he would make a good auror but somehow the idea had taken hold of him and he could not really think of anything else he would like to be moreover it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few week ago neither can live while the other survives would not he be living up to the prophecy and giving himself the best chance of survival if he joined those highly trained wizard whose job it wa to find and kill voldemort page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling draco detour harry remained within the confines of the burrow garden over the next few week he spent most of his day playing twoaside quidditch in the weasleys orchard he and hermione against ron and ginny hermione wa dreadful and ginny good so they were reasonably well matched and his evening eating triple helping of everything mr weasley put in front of him it would have been a happy peaceful holiday had it not been for the story of disappearance odd accident even of death now appearing almost daily in the prophet sometimes bill and mr weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper to mr weasleys displeasure harrys sixteenth birthday celebration were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by remus lupin who wa looking gaunt and grim his brown hair streaked liberally with gray his clothes more ragged and patched than ever page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there have been another couple of dementor attack he announced a mr weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake and they have found igor karkaroffs body in a shack up north the dark mark had been set over it well frankly i am surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the death eater sirius brother regulus only managed a few day a far a i can remember yes well said mr weasley frowning perhaps we should talk about something different did you hear about florean fortescue remus asked bill who wa being plied with wine by fleur the man who ran the icecream place in diagon alley harry interrupted with an unpleasant hollow sensation in the pit of his stomach he used to give me free ice cream what is happened to him dragged off by the look of his place why asked ron while mr weasley pointedly glared at bill who know he must have upset them somehow he wa a good man florean talking of diagon alley said mr weasley look like ollivanders gone too the wandmaker said ginny looking startled that is the one shop empty no sign of a struggle no one know whether he left voluntarily or wa kidnapped but wand what will people do for wand page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling they will make do with other maker said lupin but ollivander wa the best and if

behind and ill get your thing myself no i want to come i want to see fred and george shop said ron hastily then you just buck up your idea young man before i decide you are too immature to come with u said mr weasley angrily snatching up her clock all page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling nine hand of which were still pointing at mortal peril and balancing it on top of a pile of just laundered towel and that go for returning to hogwarts a well ron turned to stare incredulously at harry a his mother hoisted the laundry basket and the teetering clock into her arm and stormed out of the room blimey you can not even make a joke round here anymore but ron wa careful not to be flippant about voldemort over the next few day saturday dawned without any more outburst from mr weasley though she seemed very tense at breakfast bill who would be staying at home with fleur much to hermione and ginnys pleasure passed a full money bag across the table to harry where is mine demanded ron at once his eye wide that is already harrys idiot said bill i got it out of your vault for you harry because it taking about five hour for the public to get to their gold at the moment the goblin have tightened security so much two day ago arkie philpott had a probity probe stuck up his well trust me this way easier thanks bill said harry pocketing his gold e is always so thoughtful purred fleur adoringly stroking bill nose ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind fleur harry choked over his cornflakes and ron thumped him on the back page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it wa an overcast murky day one of the special ministry of magic car in which harry had ridden once before wa awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house pulling on their cloak it good dad can get u these again said ron appreciatively stretching luxuriously a the car moved smoothly away from the burrow bill and fleur waving from the kitchen window he harry hermione and ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat do not get used to it it only because of harry said mr weasley over his shoulder he and mr weasley were in front with the ministry driver the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a twoseater sofa he been given top grade security status and well be joining up with additional security at the leaky cauldron too harry said nothing he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of aurors he had stowed his invisibility cloak in his backpack and felt that if that wa good enough for dumbledore it ought to be good enough for the ministry though now he came to think of it he wa not sure the ministry knew about his cloak here you are then said the driver a surprisingly short while later speaking for the first time a he slowed in charing cross road and stopped outside the leaky cauldron i am to wait for you any idea how long you be a couple of hour i expect said mr weasley ah good he here page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry imitated mr weasley and peered through the window his heart leapt there were no aurors waiting outside the inn but instead the gigantic black bearded form of rubeus hagrid the hogwarts gamekeeper wearing a long beaverskin coat beaming at the sight of harrys face and oblivious to the startled stare of passing muggles harry he boomed sweeping harry into a bone crushing hug the moment harry had stepped out of the car buckbeak witherwings i mean yeh should see him harry he so happy ter be back in the open air glad he pleased said harry grinning a he massaged his rib we did not know security meant you i know jus like old time is it not see the ministry wanted ter send a bunch o aurors but dumbledore said id do said hagrid proudly throwing out his chest and tucking his thumb into his pocket let u get goin then after yeh molly arthur the leaky cauldron wa for the first time in harrys memory completely empty only tom the landlord wizened and toothless remained of the old crowd he looked up hopefully a they entered but before he could speak hagrid said importantly jus passin through today tom sure yeh understand hogwarts business yeh know tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glass harry hermione hagrid and the weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbin stood hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall which opened at once to form an archway onto a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling winding cobbled street they stepped through the entrance and paused looking around diagon alley had changed the colorful glittering window display of spellbooks potion ingredient and cauldron were lost to view hidden behind the large ministry of magic poster that had been pasted over them most of these somber purple poster carried blownup version of the security advice on the ministry pamphlet that had been sent out over the summer but others bore moving blackandwhite photograph of death eater known to be on the loose bellatrix lestrange wa sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary a few window were boarded up including those of florean fortescues ice cream parlor on the other hand a number of shabbylooking stall had sprung up along the street the nearest one which had been erected outside flourish and blotts under a striped stained awning had a cardboard sign pinned to it front amulet effective against werewolf dementors and inferi a seedylooking little wizard wa rattling armful of silver symbol on chain at passersby one for your little girl madam he called at mr weasley a they passed leering at ginny protect her pretty neck if i were on duty said mr weasley glaring angrily at the amulet seller yes but do not go arresting anyone now dear were in a hurry said mr weasley nervously consulting a list i think wed better do madam malkins first hermione want new dress robe and ron showing page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling much too much ankle in his school robe and you must need new one too harry you have grown so much come on everyone molly it doe not make sense for all of u to go to madam malkins said mr weasley why do not those three go with hagrid and we can go to flourish and blotts and get everyone is schoolbook i do not know said mr weasley anxiously clearly torn between a desire to finish the shopping quickly and the wish to stick together in a pack hagrid do you think don fret they will be fine with me molly said hagrid soothingly waving an airy hand the size of a dustbin lid mr weasley did not look entirely convinced but allowed the separation scurrying off toward flourish and blotts with her husband and ginny while harry ron hermione and hagrid set off for madam malkins harry noticed that many of the people who passed them had the same harried anxious look a mr weasley and that nobody wa stopping to talk anymore the shopper stayed together in their own tightly knit group moving intently about their business nobody seemed to be shopping alone migh be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of u said hagrid stopping outside madam malkins and bending down to peer through the window ill stand guard outside all right so harry ron and hermione entered the little shop together it appeared at first glance to be empty but no sooner had the door swung shut behind them than they heard a familiar voice issuing from behind a rack of dress robe in spangled green and blue page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling not a child in case you have not noticed mother i am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone there wa a clucking noise and a voice harry recognized a that of madam malkin the owner said now dear your mother quite right none of u is supposed to go wandering around on our own anymore it nothing to do with being a child watch where you are sticking that pin will you a teenage boy with a pale pointed face and white blond hair appeared from behind the rack wearing a handsome set of dark green robe that glittered with pin around the hem and the edge of the sleeve he strode to the mirror and examined himself it wa a few moment before he noticed harry ron and hermione reflected over his shoulder his light gray eye narrowed if you are wondering what the smell is mother a mudblood just walked in said draco malfoy i do not think there is any need for language like that said madam malkin scurrying out from behind the clothes rack holding a tape measure and a wand and i do not want wand drawn in my shop either she added hastily for a glance toward the door had shown her harry and ron both standing there with their wand out and pointing at malfoy hermione who wa standing slightly behind them whispered no do not honestly it not worth it yeah like you would dare do magic out of school sneered malfoy who blacked your eye granger i want to send them flower page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that is quite enough said madam malkin sharply looking over her shoulder for support madam please narcissa malfoy strolled out from behind the clothes rack put those away she said coldly to harry and ron if you attack my son again i shall ensure that it is the last thing you ever do really said harry taking a step forward and gazing into the smoothly arrogant face that for all it pallor still resembled her sister he wa a tall a she wa now going to get a few death eater pal to do u in are you madam malkin squealed and clutched at her heart really you should not accuse dangerous thing to say wand away please but harry did not lower his wand narcissa malfoy smiled unpleasantly i see that being dumbledores favorite ha given you a false sense of security harry potter but dumbledore will not always be there to protect you harry looked mockingly all around the shop wow look at that he not here now so why not have a go they might be able to find you a double cell in azkaban with your loser of a husband malfoy made an angry movement toward harry but stumbled over his overlong robe ron laughed loudly do not you dare talk to my mother like that potter malfoy snarled page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it all right draco said narcissa restraining him with her thin white finger upon his shoulder i expect potter will be reunited with dear sirius before i am reunited with lucius harry raised his wand higher harry no moaned hermione grabbing his arm and attempting to push it down by his side think you must not you will be in such trouble madam malkin dithered for a moment on the spot then seemed to decide to act a though nothing wa happening in the hope that it would not she bent toward malfoy who wa still glaring at harry i think this left sleeve could come up a little bit more dear let me just ouch bellowed malfoy slapping her hand away watch where you are putting your pin woman mother i do not think i want these anymore he pulled the robe over his head and threw them onto the floor at madam malkins foot you are right draco said narcissa with a contemptuous glance at hermione now i know the kind of scum that shop here well do better at twilfitt and tatting and with that the pair of them strode out of the shop malfoy taking care to bang a hard a he could into ron on the way out well reallyl said madam malkin snatching up the fallen robe and moving the tip of her wand over them like a vacuum cleaner so that it removed all the dust page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she wa distracted all through the fitting of ron and harrys new robe tried to sell hermione wizard dress robe instead of witch and when she finally bowed them out of the shop it wa with an air of being glad to see the back of them got evrything asked hagrid brightly when they reappeared at his side just about said harry did you see the malfoys yeah said hagrid unconcerned bu they wouldn dare make trouble in the middle o diagon alley harry don worry abou them harry ron and hermione exchanged look but before they could disabuse hagrid of this comfortable notion mr and mr weasley and ginny appeared all clutching heavy package of book everyone all right said mr weasley got your robe right then we can pop in at the apothecary and eeylops on the way to fred and george stick close now neither harry nor ron bought any ingredient at the apothecary seeing that they were no longer studying potion but both bought large box of owl nut for hedwig and pigwidgeon at eeylops owl emporium then with mr weasley checking her watch every minute or so they headed farther along the street in search of weasleys wizard wheeze the joke shop run by fred and george we really have not got too long mr weasley said so well just have a quick look around and then back to the car we must be close that is number ninety two ninetyfour page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling whoa said ron stopping in his track set against the dull postermuffled shop front around them fred and george window hit the eye like a firework display casual passersby were looking back over their shoulder at the window and a few rather stunnedlooking people had actually come to a halt transfixed the lefthand window wa dazzlingly full of an assortment of good that revolved popped flashed bounced and shrieked harrys eye began to water just looking at it the righthand window wa covered with a gigantic poster purple like those of the ministry but emblazoned with flashing yellow letter why are you worrying about youknowwho you should be worrying about unopoo the constipation sensation that is gripping the nation harry started to laugh he heard a weak sort of moan beside him and looked around to see mr weasley gazing dumbfounded at the poster her lip moved silently mouthing the name unopoo they will be murdered in their bed she whispered no they will not said ron who like harry wa laughing this is brilliant and he and harry led the way into the shop it wa packed with customer harry could not get near the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling shelf he stared around looking up at the box piled to the ceiling here were the skiving snackboxes that the twin had perfected during their last unfinished year at hogwarts harry noticed that the nosebleed nougat wa most popular with only one battered box left on the shelf there were bin full of trick wand the cheapest merely turning into rubber chicken or pair of brief when waved the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck and box of quill which came in self inking spellchecking and smartanswer variety a space cleared in the crowd and harry pushed his way toward the counter where a gaggle of delighted tenyearolds wa watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the step to a real set of gallows both perched on a box that read reusable hangman spell it or hell swing patented daydream charm hermione had managed to squeeze through to a large display near the counter and wa reading the information on the back of a box bearing a highly colored picture of a handsome youth and a swooning girl who were standing on the deck of a pirate ship one simple incantation and you will enter a top quality highly realistic thirtyminute daydream easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable side effect include vacant expression and minor drooling not for sale to undersixteens you know said hermione looking up at harry that really is extraordinary magic for that hermione said a voice behind them you can have one for free page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling a beaming fred stood before them wearing a set of magenta robe that clashed magnificently with his flaming hair how are you harry they shook hand and what is happened to your eye hermione your punching telescope she said ruefully oh blimey i forgot about those said fred here he pulled a tub out of his pocket and handed it to her she unscrewed it gingerly to reveal a thick yellow paste just dab it on that bruisell be gone within the hour said fred we had to find a decent bruise remover were testing most of our product on ourselves hermione looked nervous it is safe is not it she asked course it is said fred bracingly come on harry ill give you a tour harry left hermione dabbing her black eye with paste and followed fred toward the back of the shop where he saw a stand of card and rope trick muggle magic trick said fred happily pointing them out for freak like dad you know who love muggle stuff it not a big earner but we do fairly steady business they are great novelty oh here is george freds twin shook harrys hand energetically page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling giving him the tour come through the back harry that is where were making the real money pocket anything you and you will pay in more than galleonsv he added warningly to a small boy who hastily whipped his hand out of the tub labeled edible dark mark they will make anyone sick george pushed back a curtain beside the muggle trick and harry saw a darker le crowded room the packaging on the product lining these shelf wa more subdued we have just developed this more serious line said fred funny how it happened you would not believe how many people even people who work at the ministry can not do a decent shield charm said george course they did not have you teaching them harry that is right well we thought shield hat were a bit of a laugh you know challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounce off but the ministry bought five hundred for all it support staff and were still getting massive order so we have expanded into a range of shield cloak shield glove i mean they would not help much against the unforgivable curse but for minor to moderate hex or jinx and then we thought wed get into the whole area of defense against the dark art because it such a money spinner continued george enthusiastically this is cool look instant darkness powder were page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling importing it from peru handy if you want to make a quick escape and our decoy detonator are just walking off the shelf look said fred pointing at a number of weirdlooking black horntype object that were indeed attempting to scurry out of sight you just drop one surreptitiously and it will run off and make a nice loud noise out of sight giving you a diversion if you need one handy said harry impressed here said george catching a couple and throwing them to harry a young witch with short blonde hair poked her head around the curtain harry saw that she too wa wearing magenta staff robe there is a customer out here looking for a joke cauldron mr weasley and mr weasley she said harry found it very odd to hear fred and george called mr weasley but they took it in their stride right you are verity i am coming said george promptly harry you help yourself to anything you want all right no charge i can not do that said harry who had already pulled out his money bag to pay for the decoy detonator you do not pay here said fred firmly waving away harrys gold but page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you gave u our startup loan we have not forgotten said george sternly take whatever you like and just remember to tell people where you got it if they ask george swept off through the curtain to help with the customer and fred led harry back into the main part of the shop to find hermione and ginny still poring over the patented daydream charm have not you girl found our special wonderwitch product yet asked fred follow me lady near the window wa an array of violently pink product around which a cluster of excited girl wa giggling enthusiastically hermione and ginny both hung back looking wary there you go said fred proudly best range of love potion you will find anywhere ginny raised an eyebrow skeptically do they work she asked certainly they work for up to twentyfour hour at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question and the attractiveness of the girl said george reappearing suddenly at their side but were not selling them to our sister he added becoming suddenly stern not when she is already got about five boy on the go from what we have whatever you have heard from ron is a big fat lie said ginny calmly leaning forward to take a small pink pot off the shelf what is this guaranteed tensecond pimple vanisher said fred excellent on everything from boil to blackhead but page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling do not change the subject are you or are you not currently going out with a boy called dean thomas yes i am said ginny and last time i looked he wa definitely one boy not five what are those she wa pointing at a number of round ball of fluff in shade of pink and purple all rolling around the bottom of a cage and emitting highpitched squeak pygmy puff said george miniature puffskeins we can not breed them fast enough so what about michael corner i dumped him he wa a bad loser said ginny putting a finger through the bar of the cage and watching the pygmy puff crowd around it they are really cute they are fairly cuddly yes conceded fred but you are moving through boyfriend a bit fast are not you ginny turned to look at him her hand on her hip there wa such a mr weasleyish glare on her face that harry wa surprised fred did not recoil it none of your business and ill thank you she added angrily to ron who had just appeared at george elbow laden with merchandise not to tell tale about me to these two that is three galleon nine sickle and a knut said fred examining the many box in ron arm cough up i am your brother page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and that is our stuff you are nicking three galleon nine sickle ill knock off the knut but i have not got three galleon nine sickle you would better put it back then and mind you put it on the right shelf ron dropped several box swore and made a rude hand gesture at fred that wa unfortunately spotted by mr weasley who had chosen that moment to appear if i see you do that again ill jinx your finger together she said sharply mum can i have a pygmy puff said ginny at once a what said mr weasley warily look they are so sweet mr weasley moved aside to look at the pygmy puff and harry ron and hermione momentarily had an unimpeded view out of the window draco malfoy wa hurrying up the street alone a he passed weasleys wizard wheeze he glanced over his shoulder second later he moved beyond the scope of the window and they lost sight of him wonder where his mummy is said harry frowning given her the slip by the look of it said ron why though said hermione harry said nothing he wa thinking too hard narcissa malfoy would not have let her precious son out of her sight willingly malfoy must have made a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling real effort to free himself from her clutch harry knowing and loathing malfoy wa sure the reason could not be innocent he glanced around mr weasley and ginny were bending over the pygmy puff mr weasley wa delightedly examining a pack of muggle marked playing card fred and george were both helping customer on the other side of the glass hagrid wa standing with his back to them looking up and down the street get under here quick said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag oh i do not know harry said hermione looking uncertainly toward mr weasley come on said ron she hesitated for a second longer then ducked under the cloak with harry and ron nobody noticed them vanish they were all too interested in fred and george product harry ron and hermione squeezed their way out of the door a quickly a they could but by the time they gained the street malfoy had disappeared just a successfully a they had he wa going in that direction murmured harry a quietly a possible so that the humming hagrid would not hear them cmon they scurried along peering left and right through shop window and door until hermione pointed ahead that is him is not it she whispered turning left big surprise whispered ron page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling for malfoy had glanced around then slid into knockturn alley and out of sight quick or well lose him said harry speeding up our feetll be seen said hermione anxiously a the cloak flapped a little around their ankle it wa much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays it doe not matter said harry impatiently just hurry but knockturn alley the side street devoted to the dark art looked completely deserted they peered into window a they passed but none of the shop seemed to have any customer at all harry supposed it wa a bit of a giveaway in these dangerous and suspicious time to buy dark artifact or at least to be seen buying them hermione gave his arm a hard pinch ouch shh look he in there she breathed in harrys ear they had drawn level with the only shop in knockturn alley that harry had ever visited borgin and burke which sold a wide variety of sinister object there in the midst of the case full of skull and old bottle stood draco malfoy with his back to them just visible beyond the very same large black cabinet in which harry had once hidden to avoid malfoy and his father judging by the movement of malfoys hand he wa talking animatedly the proprietor of the shop mr borgin an oilyhaired page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling stooping man stood facing malfoy he wa wearing a curious expression of mingled resentment and fear if only we could hear what they are saying said hermione we can said ron excitedly hang on damn he dropped a couple more of the box he wa still clutching a he fumbled with the largest extendable ear look fantastic said hermione a ron unraveled the long fleshcolored string and began to feed them toward the bottom of the door oh i hope the door is not imperturbable no said ron gleefully listen they put their head together and listened intently to the end of the string through which malfoys voice could be heard loud and clear a though a radio had been turned on you know how to fix it possibly said borgin in a tone that suggested he wa unwilling to commit himself ill need to see it though why do not you bring it into the shop i can not said malfoy it got to stay put i just need you to tell me how to do it harry saw borgin lick his lip nervously well without seeing it i must say it will be a very difficult job perhaps impossible i could not guarantee anything page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no said malfoy and harry knew just by his tone that malfoy wa sneering perhaps this will make you more confident he moved toward borgin and wa blocked from view by the cabinet harry ron and hermione shuffled sideways to try and keep him in sight but all they could see wa borgin looking very frightened tell anyone said malfoy and there will be retribution you know fenrir greyback he a family friend hell be dropping in from time to time to make sure you are giving the problem your full attention there will be no need for ill decide that said malfoy well id better be off and do not forget to keep that one safe ill need it perhaps you would like to take it now no of course i would not you stupid little man how would i look carrying that down the street just do not sell it of course not sir borgin made a bow a deep a the one harry had once seen him give lucius malfoy not a word to anyone borgin and that includes my mother understand naturally naturally murmured borgin bowing again next moment the bell over the door tinkled loudly a malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself he passed so close to harry ron and page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knee again inside the shop borgin remained frozen his unctuous smile had vanished he looked worried what wa that about whispered ron reeling in the extendable ear do not know said harry thinking hard he want something mended and he want to reserve something in there could you see what he pointed at when he said that one no he wa behind that cabinet you two stay here whispered hermione what are you but hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak she checked her hair in the reflection in the glass then marched into the shop setting the bell tinkling again ron hastily fed the extendable ear back under the door and passed one of the string to harry hello horrible morning is not it hermione said brightly to borgin who did not answer but cast her a suspicious look humming cheerily hermione strolled through the jumble of object on display is this necklace for sale she asked pausing beside a glassfronted case if you have got one and a half thousand galleon said mr borgin coldly oh er no i have not got quite that much said hermione walking on and what about this lovely um skull page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling sixteen galleon so it for sale then it is not being kept for anyone mr borgin squinted at her harry had the nasty feeling he knew exactly what hermione wa up to apparently hermione felt she had been rumbled too because she suddenly threw caution to the wind the thing is that er boy who wa in here just now draco malfoy well he a friend of mine and i want to get him a birthday present but if he already reserved anything i obviously do not want to get him the same thing so um it wa a pretty lame story in harrys opinion and apparently borgin thought so too out he said sharply get out hermione did not wait to be asked twice but hurried to the door with borgin at her heel a the bell tinkled again borgin slammed the door behind her and put up the closed sign ah well said ron throwing the cloak back over hermione worth a try but you were a bit obvious well next time you can show me how it done master of mystery she snapped ron and hermione bickered all the way back to weasleys wizard wheeze where they were forced to stop so that they could dodge undetected around a very anxiouslooking mr weasley and hagrid who had clearly noticed their absence once in the shop harry whipped off the invisibility cloak hid it in his page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling bag and joined in with the other two when they insisted in answer to mr weasleys accusation that they had been in the back room all along and that she could not have looked properly page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the slug club harry spent a lot of the last week of the holiday pondering the meaning of malfoys behavior in knockturn alley what disturbed him most wa the satisfied look on malfoys face a he had left the shop nothing that made malfoy look that happy could be good news to his slight annoyance however neither ron nor hermione seemed quite a curious about malfoys activity a he wa or at least they seemed to get bored of discussing it after a few day yes i have already agreed it wa fishy harry said hermione a little impatiently she wa sitting on the windowsill in fred and george room with her foot up on one of the cardboard box and had only grudgingly looked up from her new copy of advanced rune translation but have not we agreed there could be a lot of explanation maybe he broken his hand of glory said ron vaguely a he attempted to straighten his page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling broomstick bent tail twig remember that shriveledup arm malfoy had but what about when he said do not forget to keep that one safe asked harry for the umpteenth time that sounded to me like borgins got another one of the broken object and malfoy want both you reckon said ron now trying to scrape some dirt off his broom handle yeah i do said harry when neither ron nor hermione answered he said malfoys father in azkaban do not you think malfoyd like revenge ron looked up blinking malfoy revenge what can he do about it that is my point i do not know said harry frustrated but he up to something and i think we should take it seriously his father a death eater and harry broke off his eye fixed on the window behind hermione his mouth open a startling thought had just occurred to him harry said hermione in an anxious voice what is wrong your scar not hurting again is it asked ron nervously he a death eater said harry slowly he replaced his father a a death eater page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there wa a silence then ron erupted in laughter malfoy he sixteen harry you think youknow who would let malfoy join it seems very unlikely harry said hermione in a repressive sort of voice what make you think in madam malkins she did not touch him but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve it wa his left arm he been branded with the dark mark ron and hermione looked at each other well said ron sounding thoroughly unconvinced i think he just wanted to get out of there harry said hermione he showed borgin something we could not see harry pressed on stubbornly something that seriously scared borgin it wa the mark i know it he wa showing borgin who he wa dealing with you saw how seriously borgin took him ron and hermione exchanged another look i am not sure harry yeah i still do not reckon youknowwho would let malfoy join annoyed but absolutely convinced he wa right harry snatched up a pile of filthy quidditch robe and left the room mr weasley had been urging them for day not to leave their washing and packing until the last moment on the landing he bumped into ginny who wa returning to her room carrying a pile of freshly laundered clothes page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i would not go in the kitchen just now she warned him there is a lot of phlegm around ill be careful not to slip in it harry smiled sure enough when he entered the kitchen it wa to find fleur sitting at the kitchen table in full flow about plan for her wedding to bill while mr weasley kept watch over a pile of selfpeeling sprout looking badtempered bill and i ave almost decided on only two bridesmaid ginny and gabrielle will look very sweet togezzer i am theenking of dressing zem in pale gold pink would of course be orrible with ginnys air ah harry said mr weasley loudly cutting across fleurs monologue good i wanted to explain about the security arrangement for the journey to hogwarts tomorrow we have got ministry car again and there will be aurors waiting at the station is tonks going to be there asked harry handing over his quidditch thing no i do not think so she is been stationed somewhere else from what arthur said she ha let erself go zat tonks fleur mused examining her own stunning reflection in the back of a teaspoon a big mistake if you ask yes thank you said mr weasley tartly cutting across fleur again you would better get on harry i want the trunk ready tonight if possible so we do not have the usual lastminute scramble page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and in fact their departure the following morning wa smoother than usual the ministry car glided up to the front of the burrow to find them waiting trunk packed hermiones cat crookshanks safely enclosed in his traveling basket and hedwig ron owl pigwidgeon and ginnys new purple pygmy puff arnold in cage au revoir ariy said fleur throatily kissing him goodbye ron hurried forward looking hopeful but ginny stuck out her foot and ron fell sprawling in the dust at fleurs foot furious redfaced and dirt spattered he hurried into the car without saying goodbye there wa no cheerful hagrid waiting for them at king cross station instead two grimfaced bearded aurors in dark muggle suit moved forward the moment the car stopped and flanking the party marched them into the station without speaking quick quick through the barrier said mr weasley who seemed a little flustered by this austere efficiency harry had better go first with she looked inquiringly at one of the aurors who nodded briefly seized harrys upper arm and attempted to steer him toward the barrier between platform nine and ten i can walk thanks said harry irritably jerking his arm out of the aurors grip he pushed his trolley directly at the solid barrier ignoring his silent companion and found himself a second later standing on platform nine and threequarters where the scarlet hogwarts express stood belching steam over the crowd page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hermione and the weasleys joined him within second without waiting to consult his grimfaced auror harry motioned to ron and hermione to follow him up the platform looking for an empty compartment we can not harry said hermione looking apologetic ron and i have got to go to the prefect carriage first and then patrol the corridor for a bit oh yeah i forgot said harry you would better get straight on the train all of you you have only got a few minute to go said mr weasley consulting her watch well have a lovely term ron mr weasley can i have a quick word said harry making up his mind on the spur of the moment of course said mr weasley who looked slightly surprised but followed harry out of earshot of the others nevertheless harry had thought it through carefully and come to the conclusion that if he wa to tell anyone mr weasley wa the right person firstly because he worked at the ministry and wa therefore in the best position to make further investigation and secondly because he thought that there wa not too much risk of mr weasley exploding with anger he could see mr weasley and the grimfaced auror casting the pair of them suspicious look a they moved away when we were in diagon alley harry began but mr weasley forestalled him with a grimace page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling am i about to discover where you ron and hermione disappeared to while you were supposed to be in the back room of fred and george shop how did you harry please you are talking to the man who raised fred and george er yeah all right we were not in the back room very well then let u hear the worst well we followed draco malfoy we used my invisibility cloak did you have any particular reason for doing so or wa it a mere whim because i thought malfoy wa up to something said harry disregarding mr weasleys look of mingled exasperation and amusement he would given his mother the slip and i wanted to know why of course you did said mr weasley sounding resigned well did you find out why he went into borgin and burke said harry and started bullying the bloke in there borgin to help him fix something and he said he wanted borgin to keep something else for him he made it sound like it wa the same kind of thing that needed fixing like they were a pair and harry took a deep breath there is something else we saw malfoy jump about a mile when madam malkin tried to touch his left arm i page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling think he been branded with the dark mark i think he replaced his father a a death eater mr weasley looked taken aback after a moment he said harry i doubt whether youknowwho would allow a sixteenyearold doe anyone really know what youknowwho would or would not do asked harry angrily mr weasley i am sorry but is not it worth investigating if malfoy want something fixing and he need to threaten borgin to get it done it probably something dark or dangerous is not it i doubt it to be honest harry said mr weasley slowly you see when lucius malfoy wa arrested we raided his house we took away everything that might have been dangerous i think you missed something said harry stubbornly well maybe said mr weasley but harry could tell that mr weasley wa humoring him there wa a whistle behind them nearly everyone had boarded the train and the door were closing you would better hurry said mr weasley a mr weasley cried harry quickly he hurried forward and mr and mr weasley helped him load his trunk onto the train now dear you are coming to u for christmas it all fixed with dumbledore so well see you quite soon said mr weasley through the window a harry slammed the door shut behind him and the train page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling began to move you make sure you look after yourself and the train wa gathering speed be good and she wa jogging to keep up now stay safe harry waved until the train had turned a corner and mr and mr weasley were lost to view then turned to see where the others had got to he supposed ron and hermione were cloistered in the prefect carriage but ginny wa a little way along the corridor chatting to some friend he made his way toward her dragging his trunk people stared shamelessly a he approached they even pressed their face against the window of their compartment to get a look at him he had expected an upswing in the amount of gaping and gawping he would have to endure this term after all the chosen one rumor in the daily prophet but he did not enjoy the sensation of standing in a very bright spotlight he tapped ginny on the shoulder fancy trying to find a compartment i can not harry i said id meet dean said ginny brightly see you later right said harry he felt a strange twinge of annoyance a she walked away her long red hair dancing behind her he had become so used to her presence over the summer that he had almost forgotten that ginny did not hang around with him ron and hermione while at school then he blinked page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and looked around he wa surrounded by mesmerized girl hi harry said a familiar voice from behind him neville said harry in relief turning to see a round faced boy struggling toward him hello harry said a girl with long hair and large misty eye who wa just behind neville luna hi how are you very well thank you said luna she wa clutching a magazine to her chest large letter on the front announced that there wa a pair of free spectrespecs inside quibbler still going strong then asked harry who felt a certain fondness for the magazine having given it an exclusive interview the previous year oh yes circulation well up said luna happily let u find seat said harry and the three of them set off along the train through horde of silently staring student at last they found an empty compartment and harry hurried inside gratefully they are even staring at u said neville indicating himself and luna because were with you they are staring at you because you were at the ministry too said harry a he hoisted his trunk into the luggage rack our little adventure there wa all over the daily prophet you must have seen it yes i thought gran would be angry about all the publicity said neville but she wa really pleased page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling say i am starting to live up to my dad at long last she bought me a new wand look he pulled it out and showed it to harry cherry and unicorn hair he said proudly we think it wa one of the last ollivander ever sold he vanished next day oi come back here trevor and he dived under the seat to retrieve his toad a it made one of it frequent bid for freedom are we still doing da meeting this year harry asked luna who wa detaching a pair of psychedelic spectacle from the middle of the quibbler no point now we have got rid of umbridge is there said harry sitting down neville bumped his head against the seat a he emerged from under it he looked most disappointed i liked the da i learned load with you i enjoyed the meeting too said luna serenely it wa like having friend this wa one of those uncomfortable thing luna often said and which made harry feel a squirming mixture of pity and embarrassment before he could respond however there wa a disturbance outside their compartment door a group of fourthyear girl wa whispering and giggling together on the other side of the glass you ask him no you ill do it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and one of them a boldlooking girl with large dark eye a prominent chin and long black hair pushed her way through the door hi harry i am romilda romilda vane she said loudly and confidently why do not you join u in our compartment you do not have to sit with them she added in a stage whisper indicating nevilles bottom which wa sticking out from under the seat again a he groped around for trevor and luna who wa now wearing her free spectrespecs which gave her the look of a demented multicolored owl they are friend of mine said harry coldly oh said the girl looking very surprised oh okay and she withdrew sliding the door closed behind her people expect you to have cooler friend than u said luna once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty you are cool said harry shortly none of them wa at the ministry they did not fight with me that is a very nice thing to say beamed luna then she pushed her spectrespecs farther up her nose and settled down to read the quibbler we did not face him though said neville emerging from under the seat with fluff and dust in his hair and a resignedlooking trevor in his hand you did you should hear my gran talk about you that harry potter got more backbone than the whole ministry of magic put together she would give anything to have you a a grandson page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry laughed uncomfortably and changed the subject to owl result a soon a he could while neville recited his grade and wondered aloud whether he would be allowed to take a transfiguration newt with only an acceptable harry watched him without really listening nevilles childhood had been blighted by voldemort just a much a harrys had but neville had no idea how close he had come to having harrys destiny the prophecy could have referred to either of them yet for his own inscrutable reason voldemort had chosen to believe that harry wa the one meant had voldemort chosen neville it would be neville sitting opposite harry bearing the lightningshaped scar and the weight of the prophecy or would it would nevilles mother have died to save him a lily had died for harry surely she would but what if she had been unable to stand between her son and voldemort would there then have been no chosen one at all an empty seat where neville now sat and a scarless harry who would have been kissed good bye by his own mother not ron you all right harry you look funny said neville harry started sorry i wrackspurt got you asked luna sympathetically peering at harry through her enormous colored spectacle i what a wrackspurt they are invisible they float in through your ear and make your brain go fuzzy she said i thought i felt one zooming around in here page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she flapped her hand at thin air a though beating off large invisible moth harry and neville caught each others eye and hastily began to talk of quidditch the weather beyond the train window wa a patchy a it had been all summer they passed through stretch of the chilling mist then out into weak clear sunlight it wa during one of the clear spell when the sun wa visible almost directly overhead that ron and hermione entered the compartment at last wish the lunch trolley would hurry up i am starving said ron longingly slumping into the seat beside harry and rubbing his stomach hi neville hi luna guess what he added turning to harry malfoys not doing prefect duty he just sitting in his compartment with the other slytherins we saw him when we passed harry sat up straight interested it wa not like malfoy to pas up the chance to demonstrate his power a prefect which he had happily abused all the previous year what did he do when he saw you the usual said ron indifferently demonstrating a rude hand gesture not like him though is it well that is he did the hand gesture again but why is not he out there bullying first year do not know said harry but his mind wa racing did not this look a though malfoy had more important thing on his mind than bullying younger student page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling maybe he preferred the inquisitorial squad said hermione maybe being a prefect seems a bit tame after that i do not think so said harry i think he but before he could expound on his theory the compartment door slid open again and a breathless third year girl stepped inside i am supposed to deliver these to neville longbottom and harry ppotter she faltered a her eye met harrys and she turned scarlet she wa holding out two scroll of parchment tied with violet ribbon perplexed harry and neville took the scroll addressed to each of them and the girl stumbled back out of the compartment what is it ron demanded a harry unrolled his an invitation said harry harry i would be delighted if you would join me for a bite of lunch in compartment c sincerely professor h e f slug horn who is professor slughorn asked neville looking perplexedly at his own invitation new teacher said harry well i suppose well have to go will not we but what doe he want me for asked neville nervously a though he wa expecting detention page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no idea said harry which wa not entirely true though he had no proof yet that his hunch wa correct listen he added seized by a sudden brain wave let u go under the invisibility cloak then we might get a good look at malfoy on the way see what he up to this idea however came to nothing the corridor which were packed with people on the lookout for the lunch trolley were impossible to negotiate while wearing the cloak harry stowed it regretfully back in his bag reflecting that it would have been nice to wear it just to avoid all the staring which seemed to have increased in intensity even since he had last walked down the train every now and then student would hurtle out of their compartment to get a better look at him the exception wa cho chang who darted into her compartment when she saw harry coming a harry passed the window he saw her deep in determined conversation with her friend marietta who wa wearing a very thick layer of makeup that did not entirely obscure the odd formation of pimple still etched across her face smirking slightly harry pushed on when they reached compartment c they saw at once that they were not slughorns only invitee although judging by the enthusiasm of slughorns welcome harry wa the most warmly anticipated harry mboy said slughorn jumping up at the sight of him so that his great velvetcovered belly seemed to fill all the remaining space in the compartment his shiny bald head and great silvery mustache gleamed a brightly in the sunlight a the golden button on his waistcoat good to see you good to see you and you must be mr longbottom page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling neville nodded looking scared at a gesture from slughorn they sat down opposite each other in the only two empty seat which were nearest the door harry glanced around at their fellow guest he recognized a slytherin from their year a tall black boy with high cheekbone and long slanting eye there were also two seventhyear boy harry did not know and squashed in the corner beside slughorn and looking a though she wa not entirely sure how she had got there ginny now do you know everyone slughorn asked harry and neville blaise zabini is in your year of course zabini did not make any sign of recognition or greeting nor did harry or neville gryffindor and slytherin student loathed each other on principle this is cormac mclaggen perhaps you have come across each other no mclaggen a large wiryhaired youth raised a hand and harry and neville nodded back at him and this is marcus belby i do not know whether belby who wa thin and nervouslooking gave a strained smile and this charming young lady tell me she know you slughorn finished ginny grimaced at harry and neville from behind slughorns back well now this is most pleasant said slughorn cozily a chance to get to know you all a little better page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling here take a napkin i have packed my own lunch the trolley a i remember it is heavy on licorice wand and a poor old man digestive system is not quite up to such thing pheasant belby belby started and accepted what looked like half a cold pheasant i wa just telling young marcus here that i had the pleasure of teaching his uncle damocles slughorn told harry and neville now passing around a basket of roll outstanding wizard outstanding and his order of merlin most welldeserved do you see much of your uncle marcus unfortunately belby had just taken a large mouthful of pheasant in his haste to answer slughorn he swallowed too fast turned purple and began to choke anapneo said slughorn calmly pointing his wand at belby whose airway seemed to clear at once not not much of him no gasped belby his eye streaming well of course i daresay he busy said slughorn looking questioningly at belby i doubt he invented the wolfsbane potion without considerable hard work i suppose said belby who seemed afraid to take another bite of pheasant until he wa sure that slughorn had finished with him er he and my dad do not get on very well you see so i do not really know much about his voice tailed away a slughorn gave him a cold smile and turned to mclaggen instead page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling now you cormac said slughorn i happen to know you see a lot of your uncle tiberius because he ha a rather splendid picture of the two of you hunting nogtails in i think norfolk oh yeah that wa fun that wa said mclaggen we went with bertie higgs and rufus scrimgeour this wa before he became minister obviously ah you know bertie and rufus too beamed slughorn now offering around a small tray of pie somehow belby wa missed out now tell me it wa a harry had suspected everyone here seemed to have been invited because they were connected to somebody wellknown or influential everyone except ginny zabini who wa interrogated after mclaggen turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother from what harry could make out she had been married seven time each of her husband dying mysteriously and leaving her mound of gold it wa nevilles turn next this wa a very uncomfortable ten minute for nevilles parent well known aurors had been tortured into insanity by bellatrix lestrange and a couple of death eater crony at the end of nevilles interview harry had the impression that slughorn wa reserving judgment on neville yet to see whether he had any of his parent flair and now said slughorn shifting massively in his seat with the air of a compere introducing his star act harry potter where to begin i feel i barely scratched the surface when we met over the summer he contemplated harry for a moment a though he wa a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant then said the chosen one they are calling you now page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry said nothing belby mclaggen and zabini were all staring at him of course said slughorn watching harry closely there have been rumor for year i remember when well after that terrible night lily james and you survived and the word wa that you must have power beyond the ordinary zabini gave a tiny little cough that wa clearly supposed to indicate amused skepticism an angry voice burst out from behind slughorn yeah zabini because you are so talented at posing oh dear chuckled slughorn comfortably looking around at ginny who wa glaring at zabini around slughorn s great belly you want to be careful blaise i saw this young lady perform the most marvelous batbogey hex a i wa passing her carriage i would not cross her zabini merely looked contemptuous anyway said slughorn turning back to harry such rumor this summer of course one doe not know what to believe the prophet ha been known to print inaccuracy make mistake but there seems little doubt given the number of witness that there wa quite a disturbance at the ministry and that you were there in the thick of it all harry who could not see any way out of this without flatly lying nodded but still said nothing slughorn beamed at him so modest so modest no wonder dumbledore is so fond you were there then but the rest of the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling story so sensational of course one doe not know quite what to believe this fabled prophecy for instance we never heard a prophecy said neville turning geranium pink a he said it that is right said ginny staunchly neville and i were both there too and all this chosen one rubbish is just the prophet making thing up a usual you were both there too were you said slughorn with great interest looking from ginny to neville but both of them sat clamlike before his encouraging smile yes well it is true that the prophet often exaggerates of course slughorn said sounding a little disappointed i remember dear gwenog telling me gwenog jones i mean of course captain of the holyhead harpy he meandered off into a longwinded reminiscence but harry had the distinct impression that slughorn had not finished with him and that he had not been convinced by neville and ginny the afternoon wore on with more anecdote about illustrious wizard slughorn had taught all of whom had been delighted to join what he called the slug club at hogwarts harry could not wait to leave but could not see how to do so politely finally the train emerged from yet another long misty stretch into a red sunset and slughorn looked around blinking in the twilight good gracious it getting dark already i did not notice that they would lit the lamp you would better go and change into your robe all of you mclaggen you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails harry blaise any time you are passing same go for you miss he twinkled at ginny well off you go off you go a he pushed past harry into the darkening corridor zabini shot him a filthy look that harry returned with interest he ginny and neville followed zabini back along the train i am glad that is over muttered neville strange man is not he yeah he is a bit said harry his eye on zabini how come you ended up in there ginny he saw me hex zacharias smith said ginny you remember that idiot from hufflepuff who wa in the da he kept on and on asking about what happened at the ministry and in the end he annoyed me so much i hexed him when slughorn came in i thought i wa going to get detention but he just thought it wa a really good hex and invited me to lunch mad eh better reason for inviting someone than because their mother famous said harry scowling at the back of zabini s head or because their uncle but he broke off an idea had just occurred to him a reckless but potentially wonderful idea in a minute time zabini wa going to reenter the slytherin sixthyear compartment and malfoy would be sitting there thinking himself unheard by anybody except fellow slytherins if harry could only enter unseen behind him what might he not see or hear true there wa little of the journey left hogsmeade station had to be le than half an hour away judging by the wildness of the scenery flashing by the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling window but nobody else seemed prepared to take harrys suspicion seriously so it wa down to him to prove them ill see you two later said harry under his breath pulling out his invisibility cloak and flinging it over himself but what are you asked neville later whispered harry darting after zabini a quietly a possible though the rattling of the train made such caution almost pointless the corridor were almost completely empty now nearly everyone had returned to their carriage to change into their school robe and pack up their possession though he wa a close a he could get to zabini without touching him harry wa not quick enough to slip into the compartment when zabini opened the door zabini wa already sliding it shut when harry hastily stuck out his foot to prevent it closing what is wrong with this thing said zabini angrily a he smashed the sliding door repeatedly into harrys foot harry seized the door and pushed it open hard zabini still clinging on to the handle toppled over sideways into gregory goyles lap and in the ensuing ruckus harry darted into the compartment leapt onto zabinis temporarily empty seat and hoisted himself up into the luggage rack it wa fortunate that goyle and zabini were snarling at each other drawing all eye onto them for harry wa quite sure his foot and ankle had been revealed a the cloak had flapped around them indeed for one horrible moment he thought he saw malfoys eye follow his page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling trainer a it whipped upward out of sight but then goyle slammed the door shut and flung zabini off him zabini collapsed into his own seat looking ruffled vincent crabbe returned to his comic and malfoy sniggering lay back down across two seat with his head in pansy parkinson lap harry lay curled uncomfortably under the cloak to ensure that every inch of him remained hidden and watched pansy stroke the sleek blond hair off malfoys forehead smirking a she did so a though anyone would have loved to have been in her place the lantern swinging from the carriage ceiling cast a bright light over the scene harry could read every word of crabbes comic directly below him so zabini said malfoy what did slughorn want just trying to make up to wellconnected people said zabini who wa still glowering at goyle not that he managed to find many this information did not seem to please malfoy who else had he invited he demanded mclaggen from gryffindor said zabini oh yeah his uncle big in the ministry said malfoy someone else called belby from ravenclaw not him he a prat said pansy and longbottom potter and that weasley girl finished zabini malfoy sat up very suddenly knocking pansy hand aside page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he invited longbottom well i assume so a longbottom wa there said zabini indifferently what is longbottom got to interest slughorn zabini shrugged potter precious potter obviously he wanted a look at the chosen one sneered malfoy but that weasley girl what is so special about her a lot of boy like her said pansy watching malfoy out of the corner of her eye for his reaction even you think she is goodlooking do not you blaise and we all know how hard you are to please i would not touch a filthy little blood traitor like her whatever she looked like said zabini coldly and pansy looked pleased malfoy sank back across her lap and allowed her to resume the stroking of his hair well i pity slughorns taste maybe he going a bit senile shame my father always said he wa a good wizard in his day my father used to be a bit of a favorite of his slughorn probably ha not heard i am on the train or i would not bank on an invitation said zabini he asked me about notts father when i first arrived they used to be old friend apparently but when he heard he would been caught at the ministry he did not look happy and nott did not get an invitation did he i do not think slughorns interested in death eater malfoy looked angry but forced out a singularly humorless laugh page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well who care what he interested in what is he when you come down to it just some stupid teacher malfoy yawned ostentatiously i mean i might not even be at hogwarts next year what is it matter to me if some fat old hasbeen like me or not what do you mean you might not be at hogwarts next year said pansy indignantly ceasing grooming malfoy at once well you never know said malfoy with the ghost of a smirk i might have er moved on to bigger and better thing crouched in the luggage rack under his cloak harrys heart began to race what would ron and hermione say about this crabbe and goyle were gawping at malfoy apparently they had had no inkling of any plan to move on to bigger and better thing even zabini had allowed a look of curiosity to mar his haughty feature pansy resumed the slow stroking of malfoys hair looking dumbfounded do you mean him malfoy shrugged mother want me to complete my education but personally i do not see it a that important these day i mean think about it when the dark lord take over is he going to care how many owl or newt anyones got of course he is not it will be all about the kind of service he received the level of devotion he wa shown and you think you will be able to do something for him asked zabini scathingly sixteen year old and not even fully qualified yet page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i have just said have not i maybe he doe not care if i am qualified maybe the job he want me to do is not something that you need to be qualified for said malfoy quietly crabbe and goyle were both sitting with their mouth open like gargoyle pansy wa gazing down at malfoy a though she had never seen anything so awe inspiring i can see hogwarts said malfoy clearly relishing the effect he had created a he pointed out of the blackened window wed better get our robe on harry wa so busy staring at malfoy he did not notice goyle reaching up for his trunk a he swung it down it hit harry hard on the side of the head he let out an involuntary gasp of pain and malfoy looked up at the luggage rack frowning harry wa not afraid of malfoy but he still did not much like the idea of being discovered hiding under his invisibility cloak by a group of unfriendly slytherins eye still watering and head still throbbing he drew his wand careful not to disarrange the cloak and waited breath held to his relief malfoy seemed to decide that he had imagined the noise he pulled on his robe like the others locked his trunk and a the train slowed to a jerky crawl fastened a thick new traveling cloak round his neck harry could see the corridor filling up again and hoped that hermione and ron would take his thing out onto the platform for him he wa stuck where he wa until the compartment had quite emptied at last with a final lurch the train came to a complete halt goyle threw the door open and muscled his way out page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling into a crowd of second year punching them aside crabbe and zabini followed you go on malfoy told pansy who wa waiting for him with her hand held out a though hoping he would hold it i just want to check something pansy left now harry and malfoy were alone in the compartment people were filing past descending onto the dark platform malfoy moved over to the compartment door and let down the blind so that people in the corridor beyond could not peer in he then bent down over his trunk and opened it again harry peered down over the edge of the luggage rack his heart pumping a little faster what had malfoy wanted to hide from pansy wa he about to see the mysterious broken object it wa so important to mend petrificus totalusl without warning malfoy pointed his wand at harry who wa instantly paralyzed a though in slow motion he toppled out of the luggage rack and fell with an agonizing floorshaking crash at malfoys foot the invisibility cloak trapped beneath him his whole body revealed with his leg still curled absurdly into the cramped kneeling position he could not move a muscle he could only gaze up at malfoy who smiled broadly i thought so he said jubilantly i heard goyles trunk hit you and i thought i saw something white flash through the air after zabini came back his eye lingered for a moment upon harrys trainer page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you did not hear anything i care about potter but while i have got you here and he stamped hard on harrys face harry felt his nose break blood spurted everywhere that is from my father now let u see malfoy dragged the cloak out from under harrys immobilized body and threw it over him i do not reckon they will find you till the train back in london he said quietly see you around potter or not and taking care to tread on harrys finger malfoy left the compartment page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling snape victorious harry could not move a muscle he lay there beneath the invisibility cloak feeling the blood from his nose flow hot and wet over his face listening to the voice and footstep in the corridor beyond his immediate thought wa that someone surely would check the compartment before the train departed again but at once came the dispiriting realization that even if somebody looked into the compartment he would be neither seen nor heard his best hope wa that somebody else would walk in and step on him harry had never hated malfoy more than a he lay there like an absurd turtle on it back blood dripping sickeningly into his open mouth what a stupid situation to have landed himself in and now the last few footstep were dying away everyone wa shuffling along the dark platform outside he could hear the scraping of trunk and the loud babble of talk page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron and hermione would think that he had left the train without them once they arrived at hogwarts and took their place in the great hall looked up and down the gryffindor table a few time and finally realized that he wa not there he no doubt would be halfway back to london he tried to make a sound even a grunt but it wa impossible then he remembered that some wizard like dumbledore could perform spell without speaking so he tried to summon his wand which had fallen out of his hand by saying the word accio wand over and over again in his head but nothing happened he thought he could hear the rustling of the tree that surrounded the lake and the faroff hoot of an owl but no hint of a search being made or even he despised himself slightly for hoping it panicked voice wondering where harry potter had gone a feeling of hopelessness spread through him a he imagined the convoy of thestraldrawn carriage trundling up to the school and the muffled yell of laughter issuing from whichever carriage malfoy wa riding in where he could be recounting his attack on harry to crabbe goyle zabini and pansy parkinson the train lurched causing harry to roll over onto his side now he wa staring at the dusty underside of the seat instead of the ceiling the floor began to vibrate a the engine roared into life the express wa leaving and nobody knew he wa still on it then he felt his invisibility cloak fly off him and a voice overhead said wotcher harry there wa a flash of red light and harrys body unfroze he wa able to push himself into a more dignified sitting position hastily wipe the blood off his page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling bruised face with the back of his hand and raise his head to look up at tonks who wa holding the invisibility cloak she had just pulled away wed better get out of here quickly she said a the train window became obscured with steam and they began to move out of the station come on well jump harry hurried after her into the corridor she pulled open the train door and leapt onto the platform which seemed to be sliding underneath them a the train gathered momentum he followed her staggered a little on landing then straightened up in time to see the gleaming scarlet steam engine pick up speed round the corner and disappear from view the cold night air wa soothing on his throbbing nose tonks wa looking at him he felt angry and embarrassed that he had been discovered in such a ridiculous position silently she handed him back the invisibility cloak who did it draco malfoy said harry bitterly thanks for well no problem said tonks without smiling from what harry could see in the darkness she wa a mousyhaired and miserablelooking a she had been when he had met her at the burrow i can fix your nose if you stand still harry did not think much of this idea he had been intending to visit madam pomfrey the matron in whom he had a little more confidence when it came to healing spell but it seemed rude to say this so he stayed stockstill and closed his eye page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling episkey said tonks harrys nose felt very hot and then very cold he raised a hand and felt it gingerly it seemed to be mended thanks a lot you would better put that cloak back on and we can walk up to the school said tonks still unsmiling a harry swung the cloak back over himself she waved her wand an immense silvery fourlegged creature erupted from it and streaked off into the darkness wa that a patronus asked harry who had seen dumbledore send message like this yes i am sending word to the castle that i have got you or they will worry come on wed better not dawdle they set off toward the lane that led to the school how did you find me i noticed you had not left the train and i knew you had that cloak i thought you might be hiding for some reason when i saw the blind were drawn down on that compartment i thought id check but what are you doing here anyway harry asked i am stationed in hogsmeade now to give the school extra protection said tonks is it just you who is stationed up here or no proudfoot savage and dawlish are here too dawlish that auror dumbledore attacked last year page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that is right they trudged up the dark deserted lane following the freshly made carriage track harry looked sideways at tonks under his cloak last year she had been inquisitive to the point of being a little annoying at time she had laughed easily she had made joke now she seemed older and much more serious and purposeful wa this all the effect of what had happened at the ministry he reflected uncomfortably that hermione would have suggested he say something consoling about sirius to her that it had not been her fault at all but he could not bring himself to do it he wa far from blaming her for sirius death it wa no more her fault than anyone el and much le than his but he did not like talking about sirius if he could avoid it and so they tramped on through the cold night in silence tonks s long cloak whispering on the ground behind them having always traveled there by carriage harry had never before appreciated just how far hogwarts wa from hogsmeade station with great relief he finally saw the tall pillar on either side of the gate each topped with a winged boar he wa cold he wa hungry and he wa quite keen to leave this new gloomy tonks behind but when he put out a hand to push open the gate he found them chained shut alohomora he said confidently pointing his wand at the padlock but nothing happened that will not work on these said tonks dumbledore bewitched them himself harry looked around i could climb a wall he suggested page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no you could not said tonks flatly antiintruder jinx on all of them security been tightened a hundredfold this summer well then said harry starting to feel annoyed at her lack of helpfulness i suppose ill just have to sleep out here and wait for morning someone is coming down for you said tonks look a lantern wa bobbing at the distant foot of the castle harry wa so pleased to see it he felt he could even endure filchs wheezy criticism of his tardiness and rant about how his timekeeping would improve with the regular application of thumbscrew it wa not until the glowing yellow light wa ten foot away from them and harry had pulled off his invisibility cloak so that he could be seen that he recognized with a rush of pure loathing the uplit hooked nose and long black greasy hair of severus snape well well well sneered snape taking out his wand and tapping the padlock once so that the chain snaked backward and the gate creaked open nice of you to turn up potter although you have evidently decided that the wearing of school robe would detract from your appearance i could not change i did not have my harry began but snape cut across him there is no need to wait nymphadora potter is quite ah safe in my hand i meant hagrid to get the message said tonks frowning hagrid wa late for the startofterm feast just like potter here so i took it instead and incidentally page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling said snape standing back to allow harry to pas him i wa interested to see your new patronus he shut the gate in her face with a loud clang and tapped the chain with his wand again so that they slithered clinking back into place i think you were better off with the old one said snape the malice in his voice unmistakable the new one look weak a snape swung the lantern about harry saw fleetingly a look of shock and anger on tonkss face then she wa covered in darkness once more good night harry called to her over his shoulder a he began the walk up to the school with snape thanks for everything see you harry snape did not speak for a minute or so harry felt a though his body wa generating wave of hatred so powerful that it seemed incredible that snape could not feel them burning him he had loathed snape from their first encounter but snape had placed himself forever and irrevocably beyond the possibility of harrys forgiveness by his attitude toward sirius whatever dumbledore said harry had had time to think over the summer and had concluded that snape s snide remark to sirius about remaining safely hidden while the rest of the order of the phoenix were off fighting voldemort had probably been a powerful factor in sirius rushing off to the ministry the night that he had died harry clung to this notion because it enabled him to blame snape which felt satisfying and also because he knew that if anyone wa not sorry that sirius wa dead it wa the man now striding next to him in the darkness page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling fifty point from gryffindor for lateness i think said snape and let me see another twenty for your muggle attire you know i do not believe any house ha ever been in negative figure this early in the term we have not even started pudding you might have set a record potter the fury and hatred bubbling inside harry seemed to blaze whitehot but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to london than tell snape why he wa late i suppose you wanted to make an entrance did you snape continued and with no flying car available you decided that bursting into the great hall halfway through the feast ought to create a dramatic effect still harry remained silent though he thought his chest might explode he knew that snape had come to fetch him for this for the few minute when he could needle and torment harry without anyone else listening they reached the castle step at last and a the great oaken front door swung open into the vast flagged entrance hall a burst of talk and laughter and of tinkling plate and glass greeted them through the door standing open into the great hall harry wondered whether he could slip his invisibility cloak back on thereby gaining his seat at the long gryffindor table which inconveniently wa the farthest from the entrance hall without being noticed a though he had read harrys mind however snape said no cloak you can walk in so that everyone see you which is what you wanted i am sure harry turned on the spot and marched straight through the open door anything to get away from page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling snape the great hall with it four long house table and it staff table set at the top of the room wa decorated a usual with floating candle that made the plate below glitter and glow it wa all a shimmering blur to harry however who walked so fast that he wa passing the hufflepuff table before people really started to stare and by the time they were standing up to get a good look at him he had spotted ron and hermione sped along the bench toward them and forced his way in between them where have you blimey what have you done to your face said ron goggling at him along with everyone else in the vicinity why what is wrong with it said harry grabbing a spoon and squinting at his distorted reflection you are covered in blood said hermione come here she raised her wand said tergeol and siphoned off the dried blood thanks said harry feeling his now clean face how is my nose looking normal said hermione anxiously why should not it harry what happened we have been terrified ill tell you later said harry curtly he wa very conscious that ginny neville dean and seamus were listening in even nearly headless nick the gryffindor ghost had come floating along the bench to eavesdrop but said hermione page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling not now hermione said harry in a darkly significant voice he hoped very much that they would all assume he had been involved in something heroic preferably involving a couple of death eater and a dementor of course malfoy would spread the story a far and wide a he could but there wa always a chance it would not reach too many gryffindor ear he reached across ron for a couple of chicken leg and a handful of chip but before he could take them they vanished to be replaced with pudding you missed the sorting anyway said hermione a ron dived for a large chocolate gateau hat say anything interesting asked harry taking a piece of treacle tart more of the same really advising u all to unite in the face of our enemy you know dumbledore mentioned voldemort at all not yet but he always save his proper speech for after the feast doe not he it can not be long now snape said hagrid wa late for the feast you have seen snape how come said ron between frenzied mouthful of gateau bumped into him said harry evasively hagrid wa only a few minute late said hermione look he waving at you harry harry looked up at the staff table and grinned at hagrid who wa indeed waving at him hagrid had never quite managed to comport himself with the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dignity of professor mcgonagall head of gryffindor house the top of whose head came up to somewhere between hagrids elbow and shoulder a they were sitting side by side and who wa looking disapprovingly at this enthusiastic greeting harry wa surprised to see the divination teacher professor trelawney sitting on hagrids other side she rarely left her tower room and he had never seen her at the startofterm feast before she looked a odd a ever glittering with bead and trailing shawl her eye magnified to enormous size by her spectacle having always considered her a bit of a fraud harry had been shocked to discover at the end of the previous term that it had been she who had made the prediction that caused lord voldemort to kill harrys parent and attack harry himself the knowledge had made him even le eager to find himself in her company but thankfully this year he would be dropping divination her great beaconlike eye swiveled in his direction he hastily looked away toward the slytherin table draco malfoy wa miming the shattering of a nose to raucous laughter and applause harry dropped his gaze to his treacle tart his inside burning again what he would not give to fight malfoy oneonone so what did professor slughorn want hermione asked to know what really happened at the ministry said harry him and everyone else here sniffed hermione people were interrogating u about it on the train were not they ron yeah said ron all wanting to know if you really are the chosen one page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there ha been much talk on that very subject even amongst the ghost interrupted nearly headless nick inclining his barely connected head toward harry so that it wobbled dangerously on it ruff i am considered something of a potter authority it is widely known that we are friendly i have assured the spirit community that i will not pester you for information however harry potter know that he can confide in me with complete confidence i told them i would rather die than betray his trust that is not saying much seeing a you are already dead ron observed once again you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe said nearly headless nick in affronted tone and he rose into the air and glided back toward the far end of the gryffindor table just a dumbledore got to his foot at the staff table the talk and laughter echoing around the hall died away almost instantly the very best of evening to you he said smiling broadly his arm opened wide a though to embrace the whole room what happened to his hand gasped hermione she wa not the only one who had noticed dumbledore s right hand wa a blackened and dead looking a it had been on the night he had come to fetch harry from the dursleys whisper swept the room dumbledore interpreting them correctly merely smiled and shook his purpleandgold sleeve over his injury nothing to worry about he said airily now to our new student welcome to our old student welcome back another year full of magical education awaits you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling his hand wa like that when i saw him over the summer harry whispered to hermione i thought he would have cured it by now though or madam pomfrey would have done it look a if it died said hermione with a nauseated expression but there are some injury you can not cure old curse and there are poison without antidote and mr filch our caretaker ha asked me to say that there is a blanket ban on any joke item bought at the shop called weasleys wizard wheeze those wishing to play for their house quidditch team should give their name to their head of house a usual we are also looking for new quidditch commentator who should do likewise we are pleased to welcome a new member of staff this year professor slughorn slughorn stood up his bald head gleaming in the candlelight his big waistcoated belly casting the table below into shadow is a former colleague of mine who ha agreed to resume his old post of potion master potion potion the word echoed all over the hall a people wondered whether they had heard right potion said ron and hermione together turning to stare at harry but you said professor snape meanwhile said dumbledore raising his voice so that it carried over all the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling muttering will be taking over the position of defense against the dark art teacher no said harry so loudly that many head turned in his direction he did not care he wa staring up at the staff table incensed how could snape be given the defense against the dark art job after all this time had not it been widely known for year that dumbledore did not trust him to do it but harry you said that slughorn wa going to be teaching defense against the dark art said hermione i thought he wa said harry racking his brain to remember when dumbledore had told him this but now that he came to think of it he wa unable to recall dumbledore ever telling him what slughorn would be teaching snape who wa sitting on dumbledores right did not stand up at the mention of his name he merely raised a hand in lazy acknowledgment of the applause from the slytherin table yet harry wa sure he could detect a look of triumph on the feature he loathed so much well there is one good thing he said savagely snape ll be gone by the end of the year what do you mean asked ron that job jinxed no one lasted more than a year quirrell actually died doing it personally i am going to keep my finger crossed for another death harry said hermione shocked and reproachful page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he might just go back to teaching potion at the end of the year said ron reasonably that slughorn bloke might not want to stay longterm moody did not dumbledore cleared his throat harry ron and hermione were not the only one who had been talking the whole hall had erupted in a buzz of conversation at the news that snape had finally achieved his heart desire seemingly oblivious to the sensational nature of the news he had just imparted dumbledore said nothing more about staff appointment but waited a few second to ensure that the silence wa absolute before continuing now a everybody in this hall know lord voldemort and his follower are once more at large and gaining in strength the silence seemed to tauten and strain a dumbledore spoke harry glanced at malfoy malfoy wa not looking at dumbledore but making his fork hover in midair with his wand a though he found the headmaster word unworthy of his attention i can not emphasize strongly enough how dangerous the present situation is and how much care each of u at hogwarts must take to ensure that we remain safe the castle magical fortification have been strengthened over the summer we are protected in new and more powerful way but we must still guard scrupulously against carelessness on the part of any student or member of staff i urge you therefore to abide by any security restriction that your teacher might impose upon you however irksome you might find them in particular the rule that you are not to be out of bed after hour i implore you should you notice anything strange or suspicious within or outside the castle to report it to a member of staff page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling immediately i trust you to conduct yourselves always with the utmost regard for your own and others safety dumbledores blue eye swept over the student before he smiled once more but now your bed await a warm and comfortable a you could possibly wish and i know that your top priority is to be wellrested for your lesson tomorrow let u therefore say good night pip pip with the usual deafening scraping noise the bench were moved back and the hundred of student began to file out of the great hall toward their dormitory harry who wa in no hurry at all to leave with the gawping crowd nor to get near enough to malfoy to allow him to retell the story of the nosestamping lagged behind pretending to retie the lace on his trainer allowing most of the gryffindors to draw ahead of him hermione had darted ahead to fulfill her prefect duty of shepherding the first year but ron remained with harry what really happened to your nose he asked once they were at the very back of the throng pressing out of the hall and out of earshot of anyone else harry told him it wa a mark of the strength of their friendship that ron did not laugh i saw malfoy miming something to do with a nose he said darkly yeah well never mind that said harry bitterly listen to what he wa saying before he found out i wa there page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry had expected ron to be stunned by malfoys boast with what harry considered pure pigheadedness however ron wa unimpressed come on harry he wa just showing off for parkinson what kind of mission would youknow who have given him how dyou know voldemort doe not need someone at hogwarts it would not be the first i wish yehd stop sayin tha name harry said a reproachful voice behind them harry looked over his shoulder to see hagrid shaking his head dumbledore us that name said harry stubbornly yeah well thas dumbledore is it not said hagrid mysteriously so how come yeh were late harry i wa worried got held up on the train said harry why were you late i wa with grawp said hagrid happily los track o the time he got a new home up in the mountain now dumbledore fixed it nice big cave he much happier than he wa in the forest we were havin a good chat really said harry taking care not to catch ron eye the last time he had met hagrids halfbrother a vicious giant with a talent for ripping up tree by the root his vocabulary had comprised five word two of which he wa unable to pronounce properly oh yeah he really come on said hagrid proudly yehll be amazed i am thinkin o trainin him up a me assistant page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron snorted loudly but managed to pas it off a a violent sneeze they were now standing beside the oak front door anyway ill see yeh tomorrow fir lesson straight after lunch come early an yeh can say hello ter buck i mean witherwings raising an arm in cheery farewell he headed out of the front door into the darkness harry and ron looked at each other harry could tell that ron wa experiencing the same sinking feeling a himself you are not taking care of magical creature are you ron shook his head and you are not either are you harry shook his head too and hermione said ron she is not is she harry shook his head again exactly what hagrid would say when he realized his three favorite student had given up his subject he did not like to think page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the halfblood prince harry and ron met hermione in the common room before breakfast next morning hoping for some support for his theory harry lost no time in telling hermione what he had overheard malfoy saying on the hogwarts express but he wa obviously showing off for parkinson wa not he interjected ron quickly before hermione could say anything well she said uncertainly i do not know it would be like malfoy to make himself seem more important than he is but that is a big lie to tell exactly said harry but he could not press the point because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hand it rude to point ron snapped at a particularly minuscule firstyear boy a they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole the boy who had been page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling muttering something about harry behind his hand to his friend promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm ron sniggered i love being a sixth year and were going to be getting free time this year whole period when we can just sit up here and relax were going to need that time for studying ron said hermione a they set off down the corridor yeah but not today said ron today going to be a real dos i reckon hold it said hermione throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year who wa attempting to push past her with a limegreen disk clutched tightly in his hand fanged frisbee are banned hand it over she told him sternly the scowling boy handed over the snarling frisbee ducked under her arm and took off after his friend ron waited for him to vanish then tugged the frisbee from hermione s grip excellent i have always wanted one of these hermione s remonstration wa drowned by a loud giggle lavender brown had apparently found ron remark highly amusing she continued to laugh a she passed them glancing back at ron over her shoulder ron looked rather pleased with himself the ceiling of the great hall wa serenely blue and streaked with frail wispy cloud just like the square of sky visible through the high mullioned window while they tucked into porridge and egg and bacon harry and ron told hermione about their embarrassing conversation with hagrid the previous evening page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but he can not really think wed continue care of magical creature she said looking distressed i mean when ha any of u expressed you know any enthusiasm that is it though is it not said ron swallowing an entire fried egg whole we were the one who made the most effort in class because we like hagrid but he think we liked the stupid subject dyou reckon anyones going to go on to newt neither harry nor hermione answered there wa no need they knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue care of magical creature they avoided hagrids eye and returned his cheery wave only halfheartedly when he left the staff table ten minute later after they had eaten they remained in their place awaiting professor mcgonagalls descent from the staff table the distribution of class schedule wa more complicated than usual this year for professor mcgonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary owl grade to continue with their chosen newt hermione wa immediately cleared to continue with charm defense against the dark art transfiguration herbology arithmancy ancient rune and potion and shot off to a firstperiod ancient rune class without further ado neville took a little longer to sort out his round face wa anxious a professor mcgonagall looked down his application and then consulted his owl result herbology fine she said professor sprout will be delighted to see you back with an outstanding owl and you qualify for defense against the dark art with exceeds expectation but the problem is page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling transfiguration i am sorry longbottom but an acceptable really is not good enough to continue to newt level i just do not think you would be able to cope with the coursework neville hung his head professor mcgonagall peered at him through her square spectacle why do you want to continue with transfiguration anyway i have never had the impression that you particularly enjoyed it neville looked miserable and muttered something about my grandmother want hmph snorted professor mcgonagall it high time your grandmother learned to be proud of the grandson she is got rather than the one she think she ought to have particularly after what happened at the ministry neville turned very pink and blinked confusedly professor mcgonagall had never paid him a compliment before i am sorry longbottom but i can not let you into my newt class i see that you have an exceeds expectation in charm however why not try for a newt in charm my grandmother think charm is a soft option mumbled neville take charm said professor mcgonagall and i shall drop augusta a line reminding her that just because she failed her charm owl the subject is not necessarily worthless smiling slightly at the look of delighted incredulity on nevilles face professor mcgonagall tapped a blank schedule with the tip of page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling her wand and handed it now carrying detail of his new class to neville professor mcgonagall turned next to parvati patil whose first question wa whether firenze the handsome centaur wa still teaching divination he and professor trelawney are dividing class between them this year said professor mcgonagall a hint of disapproval in her voice it wa common knowledge that she despised the subject of divination the sixth year is being taken by professor trelawney parvati set off for divination five minute later looking slightly crestfallen so potter potter said professor mcgonagall consulting her note a she turned to harry charm defense against the dark art herbology transfiguration all fine i must say i wa pleased with your transfiguration mark potter very pleased now why have not you applied to continue with potion i thought it wa your ambition to become an auror it wa but you told me i had to get an outstanding in my owl professor and so you did when professor snape wa teaching the subject professor slughorn however is perfectly happy to accept newt student with exceeds expectation at owl do you wish to proceed with potion yes said harry but i did not buy the book or any ingredient or anything page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i am sure professor slughorn will be able to lend you some said professor mcgonagall very well potter here is your schedule oh by the way twenty hopeful have already put down their name for the gryffindor quidditch team i shall pas the list to you in due course and you can fix up trial at your leisure a few minute later ron wa cleared to do the same subject a harry and the two of them left the table together look said ron delightedly gazing at his schedule we have got a free period now and a free period after break and after lunch excellent they returned to the common room which wa empty apart from a half dozen seventh year including katie bell the only remaining member of the original gryffindor quidditch team that harry had joined in his first year i thought you would get that well done she called over pointing at the captain badge on harrys chest tell me when you call trial do not be stupid said harry you do not need to try out i have watched you play for five year you must not start off like that she said warningly for all you know there is someone much better than me out there good team have been ruined before now because captain just kept playing the old face or letting in their friend ron looked a little uncomfortable and began playing with the fanged frisbee hermione had taken from the fourthyear student it zoomed around the common room snarling and attempting to take bite of the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tapestry crookshankss yellow eye followed it and he hissed when it came too close an hour later they reluctantly left the sunlit common room for the defense against the dark art classroom four floor below hermione wa already queuing outside carrying an armful of heavy book and looking putupon we got so much homework for rune she said anxiously when harry and ron joined her a fifteen inch essay two translation and i have got to read these by wednesday shame yawned ron you wait she said resentfully i bet snape give u load the classroom door opened a she spoke and snape stepped into the corridor his sallow face framed a ever by two curtain of greasy black hair silence fell over the queue immediately inside he said harry looked around a they entered snape had imposed his personality upon the room already it wa gloomier than usual a curtain had been drawn over the window and wa lit by candlelight new picture adorned the wall many of them showing people who appeared to be in pain sporting grisly injury or strangely contorted body part nobody spoke a they settled down looking around at the shadowy gruesome picture i have not asked you to take out your book said snape closing the door and moving to face the class from behind his desk hermione hastily dropped her page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling copy of confronting the faceless back into her bag and stowed it under her chair i wish to speak to you and i want your fullest attention his black eye roved over their upturned face lingering for a fraction of a second longer on harrys than anyone el you have had five teacher in this subject so far i believe you believe like you have not watched them all come and go snape hoping you would be next thought harry scathingly naturally these teacher will all have had their own method and priority given this confusion i am surprised so many of you scraped an owl in this subject i shall be even more surprised if all of you manage to keep up with the newt work which will be much more advanced snape set off around the edge of the room speaking now in a lower voice the class craned their neck to keep him in view the dark art said snape are many varied ever changing and eternal fighting them is like fighting a manyheaded monster which each time a neck is severed sprout a head even fiercer and cleverer than before you are fighting that which is unfixed mutating indestructible harry stared at snape it wa surely one thing to respect the dark art a a dangerous enemy another to speak of them a snape wa doing with a loving caress in his voice page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling your defense said snape a little louder must therefore be a flexible and inventive a the art you seek to undo these picture he indicated a few of them a he swept past give a fair representation of what happens to those who suffer for instance the cruciatus curse he waved a hand toward a witch who wa clearly shrieking in agony feel the dementors kiss a wizard lying huddled and blankeyed slumped against a wall or provoke the aggression of the inferius a bloody mass upon the ground ha an inferius been seen then said parvati patil in a highpitched voice is it definite is he using them the dark lord ha used inferi in the past said snape which mean you would be welladvised to assume he might use them again now he set off again around the other side of the classroom toward his desk and again they watched him a he walked his dark robe billowing behind him you are i believe complete novice in the use of nonverbal spell what is the advantage of a nonverbal spell hermiones hand shot into the air snape took his time looking around at everybody else making sure he had no choice before saying curtly very well miss granger your adversary ha no warning about what kind of magic you are about to perform said hermione which give you a splitsecond advantage page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling an answer copied almost word for word from the standard book of spell grade six said snape dismissively over in the corner malfoy sniggered but correct in essential yes those who progress to using magic without shouting incantation gain an element of surprise in their spellcasting not all wizard can do this of course it is a question of concentration and mind power which some his gaze lingered maliciously upon harry once more lack harry knew snape wa thinking of their disastrous occlumency lesson of the previous year he refused to drop his gaze but glowered at snape until snape looked away you will now divide snape went on into pair one partner will attempt to jinx the other without speaking the other will attempt to repel the jinx in equal silence carry on although snape did not know it harry had taught at least half the class everyone who had been a member of the da how to perform a shield charm the previous year none of them had ever cast the charm without speaking however a reasonable amount of cheating ensued many people were merely whispering the incantation instead of saying it aloud typically ten minute into the lesson hermione managed to repel nevilles muttered jellylegs jinx without uttering a single word a feat that would surely have earned her twenty point for gryffindor from any reasonable teacher thought harry bitterly but which snape ignored he swept between them a they practiced looking just a much like an overgrown bat a ever lingering to watch harry and ron struggling with the task page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron who wa supposed to be jinxing harry wa purple in the face his lip tightly compressed to save himself from the temptation of muttering the incantation harry had his wand raised waiting on tenterhook to repel a jinx that seemed unlikely ever to come pathetic weasley said snape after a while here let me show you he turned his wand on harry so fast that harry reacted instinctively all thought of nonverbal spell forgotten he yelled protegol his shield charm wa so strong snape wa knocked offbalance and hit a desk the whole class had looked around and now watched a snape righted himself scowling do you remember me telling you we are practicing nonverbal spell potter yes said harry stiffly yes sir there is no need to call me sir professor the word had escaped him before he knew what he wa saying several people gasped including hermione behind snape however ron dean and seamus grinned appreciatively detention saturday night my office said snape i do not take cheek from anyone potter not even the chosen one that wa brilliant harry chortled ron once they were safely on their way to break a short while later page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you really should not have said it said hermione frowning at ron what made you he tried to jinx me in case you did not notice fumed harry i had enough of that during those occlumency lesson why doe not he use another guinea pig for a change what is dumbledore playing at anyway letting him teach defense did you hear him talking about the dark art he love them all that unfixed indestructible stuff well said hermione i thought he sounded a bit like you like me yes when you were telling u what it like to face voldemort you said it wa not just memorizing a bunch of spell you said it wa just you and your brain and your gut well wa not that what snape wa saying that it really come down to being brave and quickthinking harry wa so disarmed that she had thought his word a well worth memorizing a the standard book of spell that he did not argue harry hey harry harry looked around jack sloper one of the beater on last year gryffindor quidditch team wa hurrying toward him holding a roll of parchment for you panted sloper listen i heard you are the new captain whenre you holding trial i am not sure yet said harry thinking privately that sloper would be very lucky to get back on the team ill let you know page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh right i wa hoping it would be this weekend but harry wa not listening he had just recognized the thin slanting writing on the parchment leaving sloper in midsentence he hurried away with ron and hermione unrolling the parchment a he went dear harry i would like to start our private lesson this saturday kindly come along to my office at pm i hope you are enjoying your first day back at school yours sincerely albus dumbledore p s i enjoy acid pop he enjoys acid pop said ron who had read the message over harrys shoulder and wa looking perplexed it the password to get past the gargoyle outside his study said harry in a low voice ha snapes not going to be pleased i will not be able to do his detention he ron and hermione spent the whole of break speculating on what dumbledore would teach harry ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinx and hex of the type the death eater would not know hermione said such thing were illegal and thought it much more likely that dumbledore wanted to teach harry advanced defensive magic after break she went off to arithmancy while harry and ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started snapes homework this turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling when hermione joined them for their afterlunch free period though she considerably speeded up the process they had only just finished when the bell rang for the afternoon double potion and they beat the familiar path down to the dungeon classroom that had for so long been snapes when they arrived in the corridor they saw that there were only a dozen people progressing to newt level crabbe and goyle had evidently failed to achieve the required owl grade but four slytherins had made it through including malfoy four ravenclaws were there and one hufflepuff ernie macmillan whom harry liked despite his rather pompous manner harry ernie said portentously holding out his hand a harry approached did not get a chance to speak in defense against the dark art this morning good lesson i thought but shield charm are old hat of course for u old da lag and how are you ron hermione before they could say more than fine the dungeon door opened and slughorns belly preceded him out of the door a they filed into the room his great walrus mustache curved above his beaming mouth and he greeted harry and zabini with particular enthusiasm the dungeon wa most unusually already full of vapor and odd smell harry ron and hermione sniffed interestedly a they passed large bubbling cauldron the four slytherins took a table together a did the four ravenclaws this left harry ron and hermione to share a table with ernie they chose the one nearest a goldcolored cauldron that wa emitting one of the most seductive scent harry had ever inhaled somehow it reminded him simultaneously of treacle tart the woody smell of a broomstick handle page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and something flowery he thought he might have smelled at the burrow he found that he wa breathing very slowly and deeply and that the potion fume seemed to be filling him up like drink a great contentment stole over him he grinned across at ron who grinned back lazily now then now then now then said slughorn whose massive outline wa quivering through the many shimmering vapor scale out everyone and potion kit and do not forget your copy of advanced potionmaking sir said harry raising his hand harry mboy i have not got a book or scale or anything nors ron we did not realize wed be able to do the newt you see ah yes professor mcgonagall did mention not to worry my dear boy not to worry at all you can use ingredient from the store cupboard today and i am sure we can lend you some scale and we have got a small stock of old book here they will do until you can write to flourish and blotts slughorn strode over to a corner cupboard and after a moment foraging emerged with two very battered looking copy of advanced potionmaking by libatius borage which he gave to harry and ron along with two set of tarnished scale now then said slughorn returning to the front of the class and inflating his already bulging chest so that the button on his waistcoat threatened to burst off i have prepared a few potion for you to have a look at just out of interest you know these are the kind page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling of thing you ought to be able to make after completing your newt you ought to have heard of them even if you have not made them yet anyone tell me what this one is he indicated the cauldron nearest the slytherin table harry raised himself slightly in his seat and saw what looked like plain water boiling away inside it hermiones wellpracticed hand hit the air before anybody el slughorn pointed at her it veritaserum a colorless odorless potion that force the drinker to tell the truth said hermione very good very good said slughorn happily now he continued pointing at the cauldron nearest the ravenclaw table this one here is pretty well known featured in a few ministry leaflet lately too who can hermiones hand wa fastest once more it polyjuice potion sir she said harry too had recognized the slowbubbling mudlike substance in the second cauldron but did not resent hermione getting the credit for answering the question she after all wa the one who had succeeded in making it back in their second year excellent excellent now this one here yes my dear said slughorn now looking slightly bemused a hermiones hand punched the air again it amortentia page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it is indeed it seems almost foolish to ask said slughorn who wa looking mightily impressed but i assume you know what it doe it the most powerful love potion in the world said hermione quite right you recognized it i suppose by it distinctive motherofpearl sheen and the steam rising in characteristic spiral said hermione enthusiastically and it supposed to smell differently to each of u according to what attracts u and i can smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and but she turned slightly pink and did not complete the sentence may i ask your name my dear said slughorn ignoring hermiones embarrassment hermione granger sir granger granger can you possibly be related to hector dagworthgranger who founded the most extraordinary society of potioneers no i do not think so sir i am muggleborn you see harry saw malfoy lean close to nott and whisper something both of them sniggered but slughorn showed no dismay on the contrary he beamed and looked from hermione to harry who wa sitting next to her oho one of my best friend is muggleborn and she is the best in our yeah i am assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yes sir said harry well well take twenty wellearned point for gryffindor miss granger said slughorn genially malfoy looked rather a he had done the time hermione had punched him in the face hermione turned to harry with a radiant expression and whispered did you really tell him i am the best in the year oh harry well what is so impressive about that whispered ron who for some reason looked annoyed you are the best in the year i would have told him so if he would asked me hermione smiled but made a shhing gesture so that they could hear what slughorn wa saying ron looked slightly disgruntled amortentia doe not really create love of course it is impossible to manufacture or imitate love no this will simply because a powerful infatuation or obsession it is probably the most dangerous and powerful potion in this room oh yes he said nodding gravely at malfoy and nott both of whom were smirking skeptically when you have seen a much of life a i have you will not underestimate the power of obsessive love and now said slughorn it is time for u to start work sir you have not told u what is in this one said ernie macmillan pointing at a small black cauldron standing on slughorn s desk the potion within wa splashing about merrily it wa the color of molten gold and large drop were leaping like goldfish above the surface though not a particle had spilled page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oho said slughorn again harry wa sure that slughorn had not forgotten the potion at all but had waited to be asked for dramatic effect yes that well that one lady and gentleman is a most curious little potion called felix felicis i take it he turned smiling to look at hermione who had let out an audible gasp that you know what felix felicis doe miss granger it liquid luck said hermione excitedly it make you lucky the whole class seemed to sit up a little straighter now all harry could see of malfoy wa the back of his sleek blond head because he wa at last giving slughorn his full and undivided attention quite right take another ten point for gryffindor yes it a funny little potion felix felicis said slughorn desperately tricky to make and disastrous to get wrong however if brewed correctly a this ha been you will find that all your endeavor tend to succeed at least until the effect wear off why do not people drink it all the time sir said terry boot eagerly because if taken in excess it cause giddiness recklessness and dangerous overconfidence said slughorn too much of a good thing you know highly toxic in large quantity but taken sparingly and very occasionally have you ever taken it sir asked michael corner with great interest twice in my life said slughorn once when i wa twentyfour once when i wa fiftyseven two page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tablespoonful taken with breakfast two perfect day he gazed dreamily into the distance whether he wa playacting or not thought harry the effect wa good and that said slughorn apparently coming back to earth is what i shall be offering a a prize in this lesson there wa silence in which every bubble and gurgle of the surrounding potion seemed magnified tenfold one tiny bottle of felix felicis said slughorn taking a minuscule glass bottle with a cork in it out of his pocket and showing it to them all enough for twelve hour luck from dawn till dusk you will be lucky in everything you attempt now i must give you warning that felix felicis is a banned substance in organized competition sporting event for instance examination or election so the winner is to use it on an ordinary day only and watch how that ordinary day becomes extraordinary so said slughorn suddenly brisk how are you to win my fabulous prize well by turning to page ten of advanced potionmaking we have a little over an hour left to u which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the draught of living death i know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before and i do not expect a perfect potion from anybody the person who doe best however will win little felix here off you go there wa a scraping a everyone drew their cauldron toward them and some loud clunk a people began adding weight to their scale but page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling nobody spoke the concentration within the room wa almost tangible harry saw malfoy riffling feverishly through his copy of advanced potionmaking it could not have been clearer that malfoy really wanted that lucky day harry bent swiftly over the tattered book slughorn had lent him to his annoyance he saw that the previous owner had scribbled all over the page so that the margin were a black a the printed portion bending low to decipher the ingredient even here the previous owner had made annotation and crossed thing out harry hurried off toward the store cupboard to find what he needed a he dashed back to his cauldron he saw malfoy cutting up valerian root a fast a he could everyone kept glancing around at what the rest of the class wa doing this wa both an advantage and a disadvantage of potion that it wa hard to keep your work private within ten minute the whole place wa full of bluish steam hermione of course seemed to have progressed furthest her potion already resembled the smooth black currantcolored liquid mentioned a the ideal halfway stage having finished chopping his root harry bent low over his book again it wa really very irritating having to try and decipher the direction under all the stupid scribble of the previous owner who for some reason had taken issue with the order to cut up the sopophorous bean and had written in the alternative instruction crush with flat side of silver dagger release juice better than cutting page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling sir i think you knew my grandfather abraxas malfoy harry looked up slughorn wa just passing the slytherin table yes said slughorn without looking at malfoy i wa sorry to hear he had died although of course it wa not unexpected dragon pox at his age and he walked away harry bent back over his cauldron smirking he could tell that malfoy had expected to be treated like harry or zabini perhaps even hoped for some preferential treatment of the type he had learned to expect from snape it looked a though malfoy would have to rely on nothing but talent to win the bottle of felix felicis the sopophorous bean wa proving very difficult to cut up harry turned to hermione can i borrow your silver knife she nodded impatiently not taking her eye off her potion which wa still deep purple though according to the book ought to be turning a light shade of lilac by now harry crushed his bean with the flat side of the dagger to his astonishment it immediately exuded so much juice he wa amazed the shriveled bean could have held it all hastily scooping it all into the cauldron he saw to his surprise that the potion immediately turned exactly the shade of lilac described by the textbook his annoyance with the previous owner vanishing on the spot harry now squinted at the next line of instruction according to the book he had to stir page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling counterclockwise until the potion turned clear a water according to the addition the previous owner had made however he ought to add a clockwise stir after every seventh counterclockwise stir could the old owner be right twice harry stirred counterclockwise held his breath and stirred once clockwise the effect wa immediate the potion turned palest pink how are you doing that demanded hermione who wa redfaced and whose hair wa growing bushier and bushier in the fume from her cauldron her potion wa still resolutely purple add a clockwise stir no no the book say counterclockwise she snapped harry shrugged and continued what he wa doing seven stir counterclockwise one clockwise pause seven stir counterclockwise one stir clockwise across the table ron wa cursing fluently under his breath his potion looked like liquid licorice harry glanced around a far a he could see no one el potion had turned a pale a his he felt elated something that had certainly never happened before in this dungeon and time up called slughorn stop stirring please slughorn moved slowly among the table peering into cauldron he made no comment but occasionally gave the potion a stir or a sniff at last he reached the table where harry ron hermione and ernie were sitting he smiled ruefully at the tarlike page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling substance in ron cauldron he passed over ernies navy concoction hermiones potion he gave an approving nod then he saw harrys and a look of incredulous delight spread over his face the clear winner he cried to the dungeon excellent excellent harry good lord it clear you have inherited your mother talent she wa a dab hand at potion lily wa here you are then here you are one bottle of felix felicis a promised and use it well harry slipped the tiny bottle of golden liquid into his inner pocket feeling an odd combination of delight at the furious look on the slytherins face and guilt at the disappointed expression on hermiones ron looked simply dumbfounded how did you do that he whispered to harry a they left the dungeon got lucky i suppose said harry because malfoy wa within earshot once they were securely ensconced at the gryffindor table for dinner however he felt safe enough to tell them hermiones face became stonier with every word he uttered i spose you think i cheated he finished aggravated by her expression well it wa not exactly your own work wa it she said stiffly he only followed different instruction to ours said ron could have been a catastrophe could not it but he took a risk and it paid off he heaved a sigh slughorn could have handed me that book but no i get page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the one no one ever written on puked on by the look of page fiftytwo but hang on said a voice close by harrys left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in slughorns dungeon he looked around and saw that ginny had joined them did i hear right you have been taking order from something someone wrote in a book harry she looked alarmed and angry harry knew what wa on her mind at once it nothing he said reassuringly lowering his voice it not like you know riddle diary it just an old textbook someone is scribbled on but you are doing what it say i just tried a few of the tip written in the margin honestly ginny there is nothing funny ginnys got a point said hermione perking up at once we ought to check that there is nothing odd about it i mean all these funny instruction who know hey said harry indignantly a she pulled his copy of advanced potionmaking out of his bag and raised her wand specialis revelio she said rapping it smartly on the front cover nothing whatsoever happened the book simply lay there looking old and dirty and dogeared finished said harry irritably or dyou want to wait and see if it doe a few backflips page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it seems all right said hermione still staring at the book suspiciously i mean it really doe seem to be just a textbook good then ill have it back said harry snatching it off the table but it slipped from his hand and landed open on the floor nobody else wa looking harry bent low to retrieve the book and a he did so he saw something scribbled along the bottom of the back cover in the same small cramped handwriting a the instruction that had won him his bottle of felix felicis now safely hidden inside a pair of sock in his trunk upstairs this book is the property of the halfblood prince page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the house of gaunt for the rest of the week potion lesson harry continued to follow the halfblood prince instruction wherever they deviated from libatius borage with the result that by their fourth lesson slughorn wa raving about harrys ability saying that he had rarely taught anyone so talented neither ron nor hermione wa delighted by this although harry had offered to share his book with both of them ron had more difficulty deciphering the handwriting than harry did and could not keep asking harry to read aloud or it might look suspicious hermione meanwhile wa resolutely plowing on with what she called the official instruction but becoming increasingly badtempered a they yielded poorer result than the prince harry wondered vaguely who the halfblood prince had been although the amount of homework they had been given prevented him from reading the whole of his copy of advanced potionmaking he had skimmed through it sufficiently to see that there wa page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling barely a page on which the prince had not made additional note not all of them concerned with potionmaking here and there were direction for what looked like spell that the prince had made up himself or herself said hermione irritably overhearing harry pointing some of these out to ron in the common room on saturday evening it might have been a girl i think the handwriting look more like a girl than a boy the halfblood prince he wa called harry said how many girl have been prince hermione seemed to have no answer to this she merely scowled and twitched her essay on the principle of re materialization away from ron who wa trying to read it upside down harry looked at his watch and hurriedly put the old copy of advanced potionmaking back into his bag it five to eight id better go ill be late for dumbledore ooooh gasped hermione looking up at once good luck well wait up we want to hear what he teach you hope it go okay said ron and the pair of them watched harry leave through the portrait hole harry proceeded through deserted corridor though he had to step hastily behind a statue when professor trelawney appeared around a corner muttering to herself a she shuffled a pack of dirtylooking playing card reading them a she walked page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling two of spade conflict she murmured a she passed the place where harry crouched hidden seven of spade an ill omen ten of spade violence knave of spade a dark young man possibly troubled one who dislike the questioner she stopped dead right on the other side of harrys statue well that can not be right she said annoyed and harry heard her reshuffling vigorously a she set off again leaving nothing but a whiff of cooking sherry behind her harry waited until he wa quite sure she had gone then hurried off again until he reached the spot in the seventhfloor corridor where a single gargoyle stood against the wall acid pop said harry and the gargoyle leapt aside the wall behind it slid apart and a moving spiral stone staircase wa revealed onto which harry stepped so that he wa carried in smooth circle up to the door with the brass knocker that led to dumbledores office harry knocked come in said dumbledores voice good evening sir said harry walking into the headmaster office ah good evening harry sit down said dumbledore smiling i hope you have had an enjoyable first week back at school yes thanks sir said harry you must have been busy a detention under your belt already page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling er began harry awkwardly but dumbledore did not look too stern i have arranged with professor snape that you will do your detention next saturday instead right said harry who had more pressing matter on his mind than s nape detention and now looked around surreptitiously for some indication of what dumbledore wa planning to do with him this evening the circular office looked just a it always did the delicate silver instrument stood on spindle legged table puffing smoke and whirring portrait of previous headmaster and headmistress dozed in their frame and dumbledores magnificent phoenix fawkes stood on his perch behind the door watching harry with bright interest it did not even look a though dumbledore had cleared a space for dueling practice so harry said dumbledore in a businesslike voice you have been wondering i am sure what i have planned for you during these for want of a better word lesson yes sir well i have decided that it is time now that you know what prompted lord voldemort to try and kill you fifteen year ago for you to be given certain information there wa a pause you said at the end of last term you were going to tell me everything said harry it wa hard to keep a note of accusation from his voice sir he added page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and so i did said dumbledore placidly i told you everything i know from this point forth we shall be leaving the firm foundation of fact and journeying together through the murky marsh of memory into thicket of wildest guesswork from here on in harry i may be a woefully wrong a humphrey belcher who believed the time wa ripe for a cheese cauldron but you think you are right said harry naturally i do but a i have already proven to you i make mistake like the next man in fact being forgive me rather cleverer than most men my mistake tend to be correspondingly huger sir said harry tentatively doe what you are going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy will it help me survive it ha a very great deal to do with the prophecy said dumbledore a casually a if harry had asked him about the next day weather and i certainly hope that it will help you to survive dumbledore got to his foot and walked around the desk past harry who turned eagerly in his seat to watch dumbledore bending over the cabinet beside the door when dumbledore straightened up he wa holding a familiar shallow stone basin etched with odd marking around it rim he placed the pensieve on the desk in front of harry you look worried harry had indeed been eyeing the pensieve with some apprehension his previous experience with the odd device that stored and revealed thought and memory though highly instructive had also been page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling uncomfortable the last time he had disturbed it content he had seen much more than he would have wished but dumbledore wa smiling this time you enter the pensieve with me and even more unusually with permission where are we going sir for a trip down bob ogden memory lane said dumbledore pulling from his pocket a crystal bottle containing a swirling silvery white substance who wa bob ogden he wa employed by the department of magical law enforcement said dumbledore he died some time ago but not before i had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollection to me we are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duty if you will stand harry but dumbledore wa having difficulty pulling out the stopper of the crystal bottle his injured hand seemed stiff and painful shall shall i sir no matter harry dumbledore pointed his wand at the bottle and the cork flew out sir how did you injure your hand harry asked again looking at the blackened finger with a mixture of revulsion and pity now is not the moment for that story harry not yet we have an appointment with bob ogden page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore tipped the silvery content of the bottle into the pensieve where they swirled and shimmered neither liquid nor gas after you said dumbledore gesturing toward the bowl harry bent forward took a deep breath and plunged his face into the silvery substance he felt his foot leave the office floor he wa falling falling through whirling darkness and then quite suddenly he wa blinking in dazzling sunlight before his eye had adjusted dumbledore landed beside him they were standing in a country lane bordered by high tangled hedgerow beneath a summer sky a bright and blue a a forgetmenot some ten foot in front of them stood a short plump man wearing enormously thick glass that reduced his eye to molelike speck he wa reading a wooden signpost that wa sticking out of the bramble on the lefthand side of the road harry knew this must be ogden he wa the only person in sight and he wa also wearing the strange assortment of clothes so often chosen by inexperienced wizard trying to look like muggles in this case a frock coat and spat over a striped one piece bathing costume before harry had time to do more than register his bizarre appearance however ogden had set off at a brisk walk down the lane dumbledore and harry followed a they passed the wooden sign harry looked up at it two arm the one pointing back the way they had come read great hangleton mile the arm pointing after ogden said little hangleton mile they walked a short way with nothing to see but the hedgerow the wide blue sky overhead and the swishing frockcoated figure ahead then the lane page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling curved to the left and fell away sloping steeply down a hillside so that they had a sudden unexpected view of a whole valley laid out in front of them harry could see a village undoubtedly little hangleton nestled between two steep hill it church and graveyard clearly visible across the valley set on the opposite hillside wa a handsome manor house surrounded by a wide expanse of velvety green lawn ogden had broken into a reluctant trot due to the steep downward slope dumbledore lengthened his stride and harry hurried to keep up he thought little hangleton must be their final destination and wondered a he had done on the night they had found slughorn why they had to approach it from such a distance he soon discovered that he wa mistaken in thinking that they were going to the village however the lane curved to the right and when they rounded the corner it wa to see the very edge of ogden frock coat vanishing through a gap in the hedge dumbledore and harry followed him onto a narrow dirt track bordered by higher and wilder hedgerow than those they had left behind the path wa crooked rocky and potholed sloping downhill like the last one and it seemed to be heading for a patch of dark tree a little below them sure enough the track soon opened up at the copse and dumbledore and harry came to a halt behind ogden who had stopped and drawn his wand despite the cloudless sky the old tree ahead cast deep dark cool shadow and it wa a few second before harrys eye discerned the building halfhidden amongst the tangle of trunk it seemed to him a very strange location to choose for a house or else an odd decision to leave the tree growing nearby blocking all light and the view of the valley below he wondered page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling whether it wa inhabited it wall were mossy and so many tile had fallen off the roof that the rafter were visible in place nettle grew all around it their tip reaching the window which were tiny and thick with grime just a he had concluded that nobody could possibly live there however one of the window wa thrown open with a clatter and a thin trickle of steam or smoke issued from it a though somebody wa cooking ogden moved forward quietly and it seemed to harry rather cautiously a the dark shadow of the tree slid over him he stopped again staring at the front door to which somebody had nailed a dead snake then there wa a rustle and a crack and a man in rag dropped from the nearest tree landing on his foot right in front of ogden who leapt backward so fast he stood on the tail of his frock coat and stumbled you are not welcome the man standing before them had thick hair so matted with dirt it could have been any color several of his teeth were missing his eye were small and dark and stared in opposite direction he might have looked comical but he did not the effect wa frightening and harry could not blame ogden for backing away several more pace before he spoke er good morning i am from the ministry of magic you are not welcome er i am sorry i do not understand you said ogden nervously page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry thought ogden wa being extremely dim the stranger wa making himself very clear in harrys opinion particularly a he wa brandishing a wand in one hand and a short and rather bloody knife in the other you understand him i am sure harry said dumbledore quietly yes of course said harry slightly nonplussed why can not ogden but a his eye found the dead snake on the door again he suddenly understood he speaking parseltongue very good said dumbledore nodding and smiling the man in rag wa now advancing on ogden knife in one hand wand in the other now look ogden began but too late there wa a bang and ogden wa on the ground clutching his nose while a nasty yellowish goo squirted from between his finger morfin said a loud voice an elderly man had come hurrying out of the cottage banging the door behind him so that the dead snake swung pathetically this man wa shorter than the first and oddly proportioned his shoulder were very broad and his arm overlong which with his bright brown eye short scrubby hair and wrinkled face gave him the look of a powerful aged monkey he came to a halt beside the man with the knife who wa now cackling with laughter at the sight of ogden on the ground page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ministry is it said the older man looking down at ogden correct said ogden angrily dabbing his face and you i take it are mr gaunt sright said gaunt got you in the face did he yes he did snapped ogden should have made your presence known should not you said gaunt aggressively this is private property can not just walk in here and not expect my son to defend himself defend himself against what man said ogden clambering back to his foot busybody intruder muggles and filth ogden pointed his wand at his own nose which wa still issuing large amount of what looked like yellow pu and the flow stopped at once mr gaunt spoke out of the corner of his mouth to morfin get in the house do not argue this time ready for it harry recognized parseltongue even while he could understand what wa being said he distinguished the weird hissing noise that wa all ogden could hear morfin seemed to be on the point of disagreeing but when his father cast him a threatening look he changed his mind lumbering away to the cottage with an odd rolling gait and slamming the front door behind him so that the snake swung sadly again page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it your son i am here to see mr gaunt said ogden a he mopped the last of the pu from the front of his coat that wa morfin wa not it ar that wa morfin said the old man indifferently are you pureblood he asked suddenly aggressive that is neither here nor there said ogden coldly and harry felt his respect for ogden rise apparently gaunt felt rather differently he squinted into ogden face and muttered in what wa clearly supposed to be an offensive tone now i come to think about it i have seen nose like yours down in the village i do not doubt it if your son been let loose on them said ogden perhaps we could continue this discussion inside inside yes mr gaunt i have already told you i am here about morfin we sent an owl i have no use for owl said gaunt i do not open letter then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitor said ogden tartly i am here following a serious breach of wizarding law which occurred here in the early hour of this morning all right all right all right bellowed gaunt come in the bleeding house then and much good it will do you the house seemed to contain three tiny room two door led off the main room which served a kitchen and living room combined morfin wa sitting in a filthy armchair beside the smoking fire twisting a live page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling adder between his thick finger and crooning softly at it in parseltongue hissy hissy little snakey slither on the floor you be good to morfin or hell nail you to the door there wa a scuffling noise in the corner beside the open window and harry realized that there wa somebody else in the room a girl whose ragged gray dress wa the exact color of the dirty stone wall behind her she wa standing beside a steaming pot on a grimy black stove and wa fiddling around with the shelf of squalidlooking pot and pan above it her hair wa lank and dull and she had a plain pale rather heavy face her eye like her brother stared in opposite direction she looked a little cleaner than the two men but harry thought he had never seen a more defeatedlooking person mdaughter merope said gaunt grudgingly a ogden looked inquiringly toward her good morning said ogden she did not answer but with a frightened glance at her father turned her back on the room and continued shifting the pot on the shelf behind her well mr gaunt said ogden to get straight to the point we have reason to believe that your son morfin performed magic in front of a muggle late last night there wa a deafening clang merope had dropped one of the pot page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling pick it up gaunt bellowed at her that is it grub on the floor like some filthy muggle what is your wand for you useless sack of muck mr gaunt please said ogden in a shocked voice a merope who had already picked up the pot flushed blotchily scarlet lost her grip on the pot again drew her wand shakily from her pocket pointed it at the pot and muttered a hasty inaudible spell that caused the pot to shoot across the floor away from her hit the opposite wall and crack in two morfin let out a mad cackle of laughter gaunt screamed mend it you pointless lump mend it merope stumbled across the room but before she had time to raise her wand ogden had lifted his own and said firmly reparo the pot mended itself instantly gaunt looked for a moment a though he wa going to shout at ogden but seemed to think better of it instead he jeered at his daughter lucky the nice man from the ministry here is not it perhaps hell take you off my hand perhaps he doe not mind dirty squib without looking at anybody or thanking ogden merope picked up the pot and returned it hand trembling to it shelf she then stood quite still her back against the wall between the filthy window and the stove a though she wished for nothing more than to sink into the stone and vanish mr gaunt ogden began again a i have said the reason for my visit page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i heard you the first time snapped gaunt and so what morfin gave a muggle a bit of what wa coming to him what about it then morfin ha broken wizarding law said ogden sternly morfin ha broken wizarding law gaunt imitated ogden voice making it pompous and singsong morfin cackled again he taught a filthy muggle a lesson that is illegal now is it yes said ogden i am afraid it is he pulled from an inside pocket a small scroll of parchment and unrolled it what is that then his sentence said gaunt his voice rising angrily it is a summons to the ministry for a hearing summons summons who do you think you are summoning my son anywhere i am head of the magical law enforcement squad said ogden and you think were scum do you screamed gaunt advancing on ogden now with a dirty yellow nailed finger pointing at his chest scum who will come running when the ministry tell them to do you know who you are talking to you filthy little mudblood do you i wa under the impression that i wa speaking to mr gaunt said ogden looking wary but standing his ground page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that is right roared gaunt for a moment harry thought gaunt wa making an obscene hand gesture but then realized that he wa showing ogden the ugly black stoned ring he wa wearing on his middle finger waving it before ogden eye see this see this know what it is know where it came from century it been in our family that is how far back we go and pureblood all the way know how much i have been offered for this with the peverell coat of arm engraved on the stone i have really no idea said ogden blinking a the ring sailed within an inch of his nose and it quite beside the point mr gaunt your son ha committed with a howl of rage gaunt ran toward his daughter for a split second harry thought he wa going to throttle her a his hand flew to her throat next moment he wa dragging her toward ogden by a gold chain around her neck see this he bellowed at ogden shaking a heavy gold locket at him while merope spluttered and gasped for breath i see it i see it said ogden hastily slytherinsl yelled gaunt salazar slytherins were his last living descendant what do you say to that eh mr gaunt your daughter said ogden in alarm but gaunt had already released merope she staggered away from him back to her corner massaging her neck and gulping for air so said gaunt triumphantly a though he had just proved a complicated point beyond all possible page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dispute do not you go talking to u a if were dirt on your shoe generation of pureblood wizard all more than you can say i do not doubt and he spat on the floor at ogden foot morfin cackled again merope huddled beside the window her head bowed and her face hidden by her lank hair said nothing mr gaunt said ogden doggedly i am afraid that neither your ancestor nor mine have anything to do with the matter in hand i am here because of morfin morfin and the muggle he accosted late last night our information he glanced down at his scroll of parchment is that morfin performed a jinx or hex on the said muggle causing him to erupt in highly painful hive morfin giggled be quiet boy snarled gaunt in parseltongue and morfin fell silent again and so what if he did then gaunt said defiantly to ogden i expect you have wiped the muggle s filthy face clean for him and his memory to boot that is hardly the point is it mr gaunt said ogden this wa an unprovoked attack on a defenseless ar i had you marked out a a mugglelover the moment i saw you sneered gaunt and he spat on the floor again this discussion is getting u nowhere said ogden firmly it is clear from your son attitude that he feel no remorse for his action he glanced down at his scroll of parchment again morfin will attend a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hearing on the fourteenth of september to answer the charge of using magic in front of a muggle and causing harm and distress to that same mugg ogden broke off the jingling clopping sound of horse and loud laughing voice were drifting in through the open window apparently the winding lane to the village passed very close to the copse where the house stood gaunt froze listening his eye wide morfin hissed and turned his face toward the sound his expression hungry merope raised her head her face harry saw wa starkly white my god what an eyesore rang out a girl voice a clearly audible through the open window a if she had stood in the room beside them could not your father have that hovel cleared away tom it not ours said a young man voice everything on the other side of the valley belongs to u but that cottage belongs to an old tramp called gaunt and his child the son quite mad you should hear some of the story they tell in the village the girl laughed the jingling clopping noise were growing louder and louder morfin made to get out of his armchair keep your seat said his father warningly in parseltongue tom said the girl voice again now so close they were clearly right beside the house i might be wrong but ha somebody nailed a snake to that door good lord you are right said the man voice that will be the son i told you he not right in the head do not look at it cecilia darling page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the jingling and clopping sound were now growing fainter again darling whispered morfin in parseltongue looking at his sister darling he called her so he would not have you anyway merope wa so white harry felt sure she wa going to faint what is that said gaunt sharply also in parseltongue looking from his son to his daughter what did you say morfin she like looking at that muggle said morfin a vicious expression on his face a he stared at his sister who now looked terrified always in the garden when he pass peering through the hedge at him is not she and last night merope shook her head jerkily imploringly but morfin went on ruthlessly hanging out of the window waiting for him to ride home wa not she hanging out of the window to look at a muggle said gaunt quietly all three of the gaunts seemed to have forgotten ogden who wa looking both bewildered and irritated at this renewed outbreak of incomprehensible hissing and rasping is it true said gaunt in a deadly voice advancing a step or two toward the terrified girl my daughter pureblooded descendant of salazar slytherin hankering after a filthy dirtveined muggle merope shook her head frantically pressing herself into the wall apparently unable to speak page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but i got him fathea cackled morfin i got him a he went by and he did not look so pretty with hive all over him did he merope you disgusting little squib you filthy little blood traitoa roared gaunt losing control and his hand closed around his daughter throat both harry and ogden yelled no at the same time ogden raised his wand and cried relashiol gaunt wa thrown backward away from his daughter he tripped over a chair and fell flat on his back with a roar of rage morfin leapt out of his chair and ran at ogden brandishing his bloody knife and firing hex indiscriminately from his wand ogden ran for his life dumbledore indicated that they ought to follow and harry obeyed merope s scream echoing in his ear ogden hurtled up the path and erupted onto the main lane his arm over his head where he collided with the glossy chestnut horse ridden by a very handsome darkhaired young man both he and the pretty girl riding beside him on a gray horse roared with laughter at the sight of ogden who bounced off the horse flank and set off again his frock coat flying covered from head to foot in dust running pellmell up the lane i think that will do harry said dumbledore he took harry by the elbow and tugged next moment they were both soaring weightlessly through darkness until they landed squarely on their foot back in dumbledore s now twilit office what happened to the girl in the cottage said harry at once a dumbledore lit extra lamp with a flick of his wand merope or whatever her name wa page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh she survived said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk and indicating that harry should sit down too ogden apparated back to the ministry and returned with reinforcement within fifteen minute morfin and his father attempted to fight but both were overpowered removed from the cottage and subsequently convicted by the wizengamot morfin who already had a record of muggle attack wa sentenced to three year in azkaban marvolo who had injured several ministry employee in addition to ogden received six month marvolo harry repeated wonderingly that is right said dumbledore smiling in approval i am glad to see you are keeping up that old man wa voldemorts grandfather yes said dumbledore marvolo his son morfin and his daughter merope were the last of the gaunts a very ancient wizarding family noted for a vein of instability and violence that flourished through the generation due to their habit of marrying their own cousin lack of sense coupled with a great liking for grandeur meant that the family gold wa squandered several generation before marvolo wa born he a you saw wa left in squalor and poverty with a very nasty temper a fantastic amount of arrogance and pride and a couple of family heirloom that he treasured just a much a his son and rather more than his daughter so merope said harry leaning forward in his chair and staring at dumbledore so merope wa sir doe that mean she wa voldemorts mother page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it doe said dumbledore and it so happens that we also had a glimpse of voldemorts father i wonder whether you noticed the muggle morfin attacked the man on the horse very good indeed said dumbledore beaming yes that wa tom riddle senior the handsome muggle who used to go riding past the gaunt cottage and for whom merope gaunt cherished a secret burning passion and they ended up married harry said in disbelief unable to imagine two people le likely to fall in love i think you are forgetting said dumbledore that merope wa a witch i do not believe that her magical power appeared to their best advantage when she wa being terrorized by her father once marvolo and morfin were safely in azkaban once she wa alone and free for the first time in her life then i am sure she wa able to give full rein to her ability and to plot her escape from the desperate life she had led for eighteen year can you not think of any measure merope could have taken to make tom riddle forget his muggle companion and fall in love with her instead the imperius curse harry suggested or a love potion very good personally i am inclined to think that she used a love potion i am sure it would have seemed more romantic to her and i do not think it would have been very difficult some hot day when riddle wa riding alone to persuade him to take a drink of water in any case within a few month of the scene page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling we have just witnessed the village of little hangleton enjoyed a tremendous scandal you can imagine the gossip it caused when the squire son ran off with the tramp daughter merope but the villager shock wa nothing to marvolos he returned from azkaban expecting to find his daughter dutifully awaiting his return with a hot meal ready on his table instead he found a clear inch of dust and her note of farewell explaining what she had done from all that i have been able to discover he never mentioned her name or existence from that time forth the shock of her desertion may have contributed to his early death or perhaps he had simply never learned to feed himself azkaban had greatly weakened marvolo and he did not live to see morfin return to the cottage and merope she she died did not she wa not voldemort brought up in an orphanage yes indeed said dumbledore we must do a certain amount of guessing here although i do not think it is difficult to deduce what happened you see within a few month of their runaway marriage tom riddle reappeared at the manor house in little hangleton without his wife the rumor flew around the neighborhood that he wa talking of being hoodwinked and taken in what he meant i am sure is that he had been under an enchantment that had now lifted though i daresay he did not dare use those precise word for fear of being thought insane when they heard what he wa saying however the villager guessed that merope had lied to tom riddle pretending that she wa going to have his baby and that he had married her for this reason page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but she did have his baby but not until a year after they were married tom riddle left her while she wa still pregnant what went wrong asked harry why did the love potion stop working again this is guesswork said dumbledore but i believe that merope who wa deeply in love with her husband could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical mean i believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion perhaps besotted a she wa she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby sake if so she wa wrong on both count he left her never saw her again and never troubled to discover what became of his son the sky outside wa inky black and the lamp in dumbledore s office seemed to glow more brightly than before i think that will do for tonight harry said dumbledore after a moment or two yes sir said harry he got to his foot but did not leave sir is it important to know all this about voldemorts past very important i think said dumbledore and it it got something to do with the prophecy it ha everything to do with the prophecy page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling right said harry a little confused but reassured all the same he turned to go then another question occurred to him and he turned back again sir am i allowed to tell ron and hermione everything you have told me dumbledore considered him for a moment then said yes i think mr weasley and miss granger have proved themselves trustworthy but harry i am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else it would not be a good idea if word got around how much i know or suspect about lord voldemorts secret no sir ill make sure it just ron and hermione good night he turned away again and wa almost at the door when he saw it sitting on one of the little spindle legged table that supported so many fraillooking silver instrument wa an ugly gold ring set with a large cracked black stone sir said harry staring at it that ring yes said dumbledore you were wearing it when we visited professor slughorn that night so i wa dumbledore agreed but is not it sir is not it the same ring marvolo gaunt showed ogden dumbledore bowed his head the very same but how come have you always had it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no i acquired it very recently said dumbledore a few day before i came to fetch you from your aunt and uncle in fact that would be around the time you injured your hand then sir around that time yes harry harry hesitated dumbledore wa smiling sir how exactly too late harry you shall hear the story another time good night good night sir page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hermiones helping hand a hermione had predicted the sixth year free period were not the hour of blissful relaxation ron had anticipated but time in which to attempt to keep up with the vast amount of homework they were being set not only were they studying a though they had exam every day but the lesson themselves had become more demanding than ever before harry barely understood half of what professor mcgonagall said to them these day even hermione had had to ask her to repeat instruction once or twice incredibly and to hermione s increasing resentment harrys best subject had suddenly become potion thanks to the halfblood prince nonverbal spell were now expected not only in defense against the dark art but in charm and transfiguration too harry frequently looked over at his classmate in the common room or at mealtime to see them purple in the face and straining a though they had overdosed on unopoo but he knew that they were really struggling to make spell work page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling without saying incantation aloud it wa a relief to get outside into the greenhouse they were dealing with more dangerous plant than ever in herbology but at least they were still allowed to swear loudly if the venomous tentacula seized them unexpectedly from behind one result of their enormous workload and the frantic hour of practicing nonverbal spell wa that harry ron and hermione had so far been unable to find time to go and visit hagrid he had stopped coming to meal at the staff table an ominous sign and on the few occasion when they had passed him in the corridor or out in the ground he had mysteriously failed to notice them or hear their greeting we have got to go and explain said hermione looking up at hagrid s huge empty chair at the staff table the following saturday at breakfast we have got quidditch tryout this morning said ron and were supposed to be practicing that aguamenti charm from flitwick anyway explain what how are we going to tell him we hated his stupid subject we did not hate it said hermione speak for yourself i have not forgotten the skrewts said ron darkly and i am telling you now we have had a narrow escape you did not hear him going on about his gormless brother wed have been teaching grawp how to tie his shoelace if wed stayed i hate not talking to hagrid said hermione looking upset well go down after quidditch harry assured her he too wa missing hagrid although like ron he thought that they were better off without grawp in page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling their life but trial might take all morning the number of people who have applied he felt slightly nervous at confronting the first hurdle of his captaincy i do not know why the team this popular all of a sudden oh come on harry said hermione suddenly impatient it not quidditch that is popular it you you have never been more interesting and frankly you have never been more fanciable ron gagged on a large piece of kipper hermione spared him one look of disdain before turning back to harry everyone know you have been telling the truth now do not they the whole wizarding world ha had to admit that you were right about voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two year and escaped both time and now they are calling you the chosen one well come on can not you see why people are fascinated by you harry wa finding the great hall very hot all of a sudden even though the ceiling still looked cold and rainy and you have been through all that persecution from the ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar you can still see the mark on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood but you stuck to your story anyway you can still see where those brain got hold of me in the ministry look said ron shaking back his sleeve page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and it doe not hurt that you have grown about a foot over the summer either hermione finished ignoring ron i am tall said ron inconsequentially the post owl arrived swooping down through rain flecked window scattering everyone with droplet of water most people were receiving more post than usual anxious parent were keen to hear from their child and to reassure them in turn that all wa well at home harry had received no mail since the start of term his only regular correspondent wa now dead and although he had hoped that lupin might write occasionally he had so far been disappointed he wa very surprised therefore to see the snowy white hedwig circling amongst all the brown and gray owl she landed in front of him carrying a large square package a moment later an identical package landed in front of ron crushing beneath it his minuscule and exhausted owl pigwidgeon ha said harry unwrapping the parcel to reveal a new copy of advanced potionmaking fresh from flourish and blotts oh good said hermione delighted now you can give that graffitied copy back are you mad said harry i am keeping it look i have thought it out he pulled the old copy of advanced potionmaking out of his bag and tapped the cover with his wand muttering diffindol the cover fell off he did the same thing with the brandnew book hermione looked scandalized he then swapped the cover tapped each and said reparo page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there sat the prince copy disguised a a new book and there sat the fresh copy from flourish and blotts looking thoroughly secondhand ill give slughorn back the new one he can not complain it cost nine galleon hermione pressed her lip together looking angry and disapproving but wa distracted by a third owl landing in front of her carrying that day copy of the daily prophet she unfolded it hastily and scanned the front page anyone we know dead asked ron in a determinedly casual voice he posed the same question every time hermione opened her paper no but there have been more dementor attack said hermione and an arrest excellent who said harry thinking of bellatrix lestrange stan shunpike said hermione what said harry startled stanley shunpike conductor on the popular wizarding conveyance the knight bus ha been arrested on suspicion of death eater activity mr shunpike wa taken into custody late last night after a raid on his clapham home stan shunpike a death eater said harry remembering the spotty youth he had first met three year before no way he might have been put under the imperius curse said ron reasonably you never can tell page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it doe not look like it said hermione who wa still reading it say here he wa arrested after he wa overheard talking about the death eater secret plan in a pub she looked up with a troubled expression on her face if he wa under the imperius curse he would hardly stand around gossiping about their plan would he it sound like he wa trying to make out he knew more than he did said ron is not he the one who claimed he wa going to become minister of magic when he wa trying to chat up those veela yeah that is him said harry i do not know what they are playing at taking stan seriously they probably want to look a though they are doing something said hermione frowning people are terrified you know the patil twin parent want them to go home and eloise midgen ha already been withdrawn her father picked her up last night what said ron goggling at hermione but hogwarts is safer than their home bound to be we have got aurors and all those extra protective spell and we have got dumbledore i do not think we have got him all the time said hermione very quietly glancing toward the staff table over the top of the prophet have not you noticed his seat been empty a often a hagrids this past week harry and ron looked up at the staff table the headmaster chair wa indeed empty now harry came to think of it he had not seen dumbledore since their private lesson a week ago page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i think he left the school to do something with the order said hermione in a low voice i mean it all looking serious is not it harry and ron did not answer but harry knew that they were all thinking the same thing there had been a horrible incident the day before when hannah abbott had been taken out of herbology to be told her mother had been found dead they had not seen hannah since when they left the gryffindor table five minute later to head down to the quidditch pitch they passed lavender brown and parvati patil remembering what hermione had said about the patil twin parent wanting them to leave hogwarts harry wa unsurprised to see that the two best friend were whispering together looking distressed what did surprise him wa that when ron drew level with them parvati suddenly nudged lavender who looked around and gave ron a wide smile ron blinked at her then returned the smile uncertainly his walk instantly became something more like a strut harry resisted the temptation to laugh remembering that ron had refrained from doing so after malfoy had broken harrys nose hermione however looked cold and distant all the way down to the stadium through the cool misty drizzle and departed to find a place in the stand without wishing ron good luck a harry had expected the trial took most of the morning half of gryffindor house seemed to have turned up from first year who were nervously clutching a selection of the dreadful old school broom to seventh year who towered over the rest looking coolly intimidating the latter included a large wiryhaired boy harry recognized immediately from the hogwarts express page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling we met on the train in old sluggys compartment he said confidently stepping out of the crowd to shake harrys hand cormac mclaggen keeper you did not try out last year did you asked harry taking note of the breadth of mclaggen and thinking that he would probably block all three goal hoop without even moving i wa in the hospital wing when they held the trial said mclaggen with something of a swagger ate a pound of doxy egg for a bet right said harry well if you wait over there he pointed over to the edge of the pitch close to where hermione wa sitting he thought he saw a flicker of annoyance pas over mclaggens face and wondered whether mclaggen expected preferential treatment because they were both old sluggys favorite harry decided to start with a basic test asking all applicant for the team to divide into group of ten and fly once around the pitch this wa a good decision the first ten wa made up of first year and it could not have been plainer that they had hardly ever flown before only one boy managed to remain airborne for more than a few second and he wa so surprised he promptly crashed into one of the goal post the second group wa comprised of ten of the silliest girl harry had ever encountered who when he blew his whistle merely fell about giggling and clutching one another romilda vane wa amongst them when he told them to leave the pitch they did so quite cheerfully and went to sit in the stand to heckle everyone else page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the third group had a pileup halfway around the pitch most of the fourth group had come without broomstick the fifth group were hufflepuffs if there is anyone else here who is not from gryffindor roared harry who wa starting to get seriously annoyed leave now please there wa a pause then a couple of little ravenclaws went sprinting off the pitch snorting with laughter after two hour many complaint and several tantrum one involving a crashed comet two sixty and several broken teeth harry had found himself three chaser katie bell returned to the team after an excellent trial a new find called demelza robin who wa particularly good at dodging bludgers and ginny weasley who had outflown all the competition and scored seventeen goal to boot pleased though he wa with his choice harry had also shouted himself hoarse at the many complainer and wa now enduring a similar battle with the rejected beater that is my final decision and if you do not get out of the way for the keeper ill hex you he bellowed neither of his chosen beater had the old brilliance of fred and george but he wa still reasonably pleased with them jimmy peakes a short but broadchested thirdyear boy who had managed to raise a lump the size of an egg on the back of harrys head with a ferociously hit bludger and ritchie coote who looked weedy but aimed well they now joined katie demelza and ginny in the stand to watch the selection of their last team member harry had deliberately left the trial of the keeper until last hoping for an emptier stadium and le pressure on all concerned unfortunately however all page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the rejected player and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now so that it wa larger than ever a each keeper flew up to the goal hoop the crowd roared and jeered in equal measure harry glanced over at ron who had always had a problem with nerve harry had hoped that winning their final match last term might have cured it but apparently not ron wa a delicate shade of green none of the first five applicant saved more than two goal apiece to harrys great disappointment cormac mclaggen saved four penalty out of five on the last one however he shot off in completely the wrong direction the crowd laughed and booed and mclaggen returned to the ground grinding his teeth ron looked ready to pas out a he mounted his cleansweep eleven good luck cried a voice from the stand harry looked around expecting to see hermione but it wa lavender brown he would have quite liked to have hidden his face in his hand a she did a moment later but thought that a the captain he ought to show slightly more grit and so turned to watch ron do his trial yet he need not have worried ron saved one two three four five penalty in a row delighted and resisting joining in the cheer of the crowd with difficulty harry turned to mclaggen to tell him that most unfortunately ron had beaten him only to find mclaggens red face inch from his own he stepped back hastily his sister did not really try said mclaggen menacingly there wa a vein pulsing in his temple like the one harry had often admired in uncle vernons she gave him an easy save page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling rubbish said harry coldly that wa the one he nearly missed mclaggen took a step nearer harry who stood his ground this time give me another go no said harry you have had your go you saved four ron saved five ron keeper he won it fair and square get out of my way he thought for a moment that mclaggen might punch him but he contented himself with an ugly grimace and stormed away growling what sounded like threat to thin air harry turned around to find his new team beaming at him well done he croaked you flew really well you did brilliantly ron this time it really wa hermione running toward them from the stand harry saw lavender walking off the pitch arm in arm with parvati a rather grumpy expression on her face ron looked extremely pleased with himself and even taller than usual a he grinned at the team and at hermione after fixing the time of their first full practice for the following thursday harry ron and hermione bade goodbye to the rest of the team and headed off toward hagrids a watery sun wa trying to break through the cloud now and it had stopped drizzling at last harry felt extremely hungry he hoped there would be something to eat at hagrids page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i thought i wa going to miss that fourth penalty ron wa saying happily tricky shot from demelza did you see had a bit of spin on it yes yes you were magnificent said hermione looking amused i wa better than that mclaggen anyway said ron in a highly satisfied voice did you see him lumbering off in the wrong direction on his fifth looked like he would been confunded to harrys surprise hermione turned a very deep shade of pink at these word ron noticed nothing he wa too busy describing each of his other penalty in loving detail the great gray hippogriff buckbeak wa tethered in front of hagrids cabin he clicked his razorsharp beak at their approach and turned his huge head toward them oh dear said hermione nervously he still a bit scary is not he come off it you have ridden him have not you said ron harry stepped forward and bowed low to the hippogriff without breaking eye contact or blinking after a few second buckbeak sank into a bow too how are you harry asked him in a low voice moving forward to stroke the feathery head missing him but you are okay here with hagrid are not you oi said a loud voice page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hagrid had come striding around the corner of his cabin wearing a large flowery apron and carrying a sack of potato his enormous boarhound fang wa at his heel fang gave a booming bark and bounded forward git away from him hell have yer finger oh it yeh lot fang wa jumping up at hermione and ron attempting to lick their ear hagrid stood and looked at them all for a split second then turned and strode into his cabin slamming the door behind him oh dear said hermione looking stricken do not worry about it said harry grimly he walked over to the door and knocked loudly hagrid open up we want to talk to you there wa no sound from within if you do not open the door well blast it open harry said pulling out his wand harry said hermione sounding shocked you can not possibly yeah i can said harry stand back but before he could say anything else the door flew open again a harry had known it would and there stood hagrid glowering down at him and looking despite the flowery apron positively alarming i am a teacher he roared at harry a teacher potter how dare yeh threaten ter break down my door page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tm sorry sir said harry emphasizing the last word a he stowed his wand inside his robe hagrid looked stunned since when have yeh called me sir since when have you called me potter oh very clever growled hagrid very amusin that is me outsmarted is it not all righ come in then yeh ungrateful little mumbling darkly he stood back to let them pas hermione scurried in after harry looking rather frightened well said hagrid grumpily a harry ron and hermione sat down around his enormous wooden table fang laying his head immediately upon harrys knee and drooling all over his robe what is this feelin sorry for me reckon i am lonely or summat no said harry at once we wanted to see you we have missed you said hermione tremulously missed me have yeh snorted hagrid yeah righ he stomped around brewing up tea in his enormous copper kettle muttering all the while finally he slammed down three bucketsized mug of mahoganybrown tea in front of them and a plate of his rock cake harry wa hungry enough even for hagrids cooking and took one at once hagrid said hermione timidly when he joined them at the table and started peeling his potato with a brutality that suggested that each tuber had done page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling him a great personal wrong we really wanted to carry on with care of magical creature you know hagrid gave another great snort harry rather thought some bogey landed on the potato and wa inwardly thankful that they were not staying for dinner we did said hermione but none of u could fit it into our schedule yeah righ said hagrid again there wa a funny squelching sound and they all looked around hermione let out a tiny shriek and ron leapt out of his seat and hurried around the table away from the large barrel standing in the corner that they had only just noticed it wa full of what looked like footlong maggot slimy white and writhing what are they hagrid asked harry trying to sound interested rather than revolted but putting down his rock cake all the same jus giant grub said hagrid and they grow into said ron looking apprehensive they won grow inter nuthin said hagrid i got them ter feed ter aragog and without warning he burst into tear hagrid cried hermione leaping up hurrying around the table the long way to avoid the barrel of maggot and putting an arm around his shaking shoulder what is it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it him gulped hagrid his beetleblack eye streaming a he mopped his face with his apron it aragog i think he dyin he got ill over the summer an he not gettin better i don know what ill do if he if he we have bin tergether so long hermione patted hagrids shoulder looking at a complete loss for anything to say harry knew how she felt he had known hagrid to present a vicious baby dragon with a teddy bear seen him croon over giant scorpion with sucker and stinger attempt to reason with his brutal giant of a halfbrother but this wa perhaps the most incomprehensible of all his monster fancy the gigantic talking spider aragog who dwelled deep in the forbidden forest and which he and ron had only narrowly escaped four year previously is there is there anything we can do hermione asked ignoring ron frantic grimace and head shaking i don think there is hermione choked hagrid attempting to stem the flood of his tear see the rest o the tribe aragogs family they are gettin a bit funny now he ill bit restive yeah i think we saw a bit of that side of them said ron in an undertone i don reckon it would be safe fer anyone but me ter go near the colony at the mo hagrid finished blowing his nose hard on his apron and looking up but thanks fer offerin hermione it mean a lot after that the atmosphere lightened considerably for although neither harry nor ron had shown any inclination to go and feed giant grub to a murderous page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling gargantuan spider hagrid seemed to take it for granted that they would have liked to have done and became his usual self once more ar i always knew yehd find it hard ter squeeze me inter yer timetable he said gruffly pouring them more tea even if yeh applied fer timeturners we could not have done said hermione we smashed the entire stock of ministry timeturners when we were there last summer it wa in the daily prophet ar well then said hagrid there is no way yeh could have done it i am sorry i have bin yeh know i have jus bin worried abou aragog an i did wonder whether if professor grubblyplank had bin teachin yeh at which all three of them stated categorically and untruthfully that professor grubblyplank who had substituted for hagrid a few time wa a dreadful teacher with the result that by the time hagrid waved them off the premise at dusk he looked quite cheerful i am starving said harry once the door had closed behind them and they were hurrying through the dark and deserted ground he had abandoned the rock cake after an ominous cracking noise from one of his back teeth and i have got that detention with snape tonight i have not got much time for dinner a they came into the castle they spotted cormac mclaggen entering the great hall it took him two attempt to get through the door he ricocheted off the frame on the first attempt ron merely guffawed gloatingly and strode off into the hall after him but harry caught hermione s arm and held her back page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what said hermione defensively if you ask me said harry quietly mclaggen look like he wa confunded this morning and he wa standing right in front of where you were sitting hermione blushed oh all right then i did it she whispered but you should have heard the way he wa talking about ron and ginny anyway he got a nasty temper you saw how he reacted when he did not get in you would not have wanted someone like that on the team no said harry no i suppose that is true but wa not that dishonest hermione i mean you are a prefect are not you oh be quiet she snapped a he smirked what are you two doing demanded ron reappearing in the doorway to the great hall and looking suspicious nothing said harry and hermione together and they hurried after ron the smell of roast beef made harrys stomach ache with hunger but they had barely taken three step toward the gryffindor table when professor slughorn appeared in front of them blocking their path harry harry just the man i wa hoping to see he boomed genially twiddling the end of his walrus mustache and puffing out his enormous belly i wa hoping to catch you before dinner what do you say to a spot of supper tonight in my room instead were having a little party just a few rising star i have got mclaggen coming and zabini the charming melinda bobbin i do not know whether you know her her page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling family owns a large chain of apothecary and of course i hope very much that miss granger will favor me by coming too slughorn made hermione a little bow a he finished speaking it wa a though ron wa not present slughorn did not so much a look at him i can not come professor said harry at once i have got a detention with professor snape oh dear said slughorn his face falling comically dear dear i wa counting on you harry well now ill just have to have a word with severus and explain the situation i am sure ill be able to persuade him to postpone your detention yes ill see you both later he bustled away out of the hall he got no chance of persuading snape said harry the moment slughorn wa out of earshot this detention already been postponed once snape did it for dumbledore but he will not do it for anyone else oh i wish you could come i do not want to go on my own said hermione anxiously harry knew that she wa thinking about mclaggen i doubt you will be alone ginnyll probably be invited snapped ron who did not seem to have taken kindly to being ignored by slughorn after dinner they made their way back to gryffindor tower the common room wa very crowded a most people had finished dinner by now but they managed to find a free table and sat down ron who had been in a bad mood ever since the encounter with slughorn folded his arm and frowned at the ceiling hermione reached out for a copy of the evening page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling prophet which somebody had left abandoned on a chair anything new said harry not really hermione had opened the newspaper and wa scanning the inside page oh look your dad in here ron he all right she added quickly for ron had looked around in alarm it just say he been to visit the malfoys house this second search of the death eater residence doe not seem to have yielded any result arthur weasley of the office for the detection and confiscation of counterfeit defensive spell and protective object said that his team had been acting upon a confidential tipoff yeah mine said harry i told him at king cross about malfoy and that thing he wa trying to get borgin to fix well if it not at their house he must have brought whatever it is to hogwarts with him but how can he have done harry said hermione putting down the newspaper with a surprised look we were all searched when we arrived were not we were you said harry taken aback i wa not oh no of course you were not i forgot you were late well filch ran over all of u with secrecy sensor when we got into the entrance hall any dark object would have been found i know for a fact crabbe had a shrunken head confiscated so you see malfoy can not have brought in anything dangerous momentarily stymied harry watched ginny weasley playing with arnold the pygmy puff for a while before seeing a way around this objection page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling someone is sent it to him by owl then he said his mother or someone all the owl are being checked too said hermione filch told u so when he wa jabbing those secrecy sensor everywhere he could reach really stumped this time harry found nothing else to say there did not seem to be any way malfoy could have brought a dangerous or dark object into the school he looked hopefully at ron who wa sitting with his arm folded staring over at lavender brown can you think of any way malfoy oh drop it harry said ron listen it not my fault slughorn invited hermione and me to his stupid party neither of u wanted to go you know said harry firing up well a i am not invited to any party said ron getting to his foot again i think ill go to bed he stomped off toward the door to the boy dormitory leaving harry and hermione staring after him harry said the new chaser demelza robin appearing suddenly at his shoulder i have got a message for you from professor slughorn asked harry sitting up hopefully no from professor snape said demelza harrys heart sank he say you are to come to his office at half past eight tonight to do your detention er no matter how many party invitation you have received page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and he wanted you to know you will be sorting out rotten flobberworms from good one to use in potion and and he say there is no need to bring protective glove right said harry grimly thanks a lot demelza page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling silver and opal where wa dumbledore and what wa he doing harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few week he rarely appeared at meal anymore and harry wa sure hermione wa right in thinking that he wa leaving the school for day at a time had dumbledore forgotten the lesson he wa supposed to be giving harry dumbledore had said that the lesson were leading to something to do with the prophecy harry had felt bolstered comforted and now he felt slightly abandoned halfway through october came their first trip of the term to hogsmeade harry had wondered whether these trip would still be allowed given the increasingly tight security measure around the school but wa pleased to know that they were going ahead it wa always good to get out of the castle ground for a few hour harry woke early on the morning of the trip which wa proving stormy and whiled away the time until page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling breakfast by reading his copy of advanced potion making he did not usually lie in bed reading his textbook that sort of behavior a ron rightly said wa indecent in anybody except hermione who wa simply weird that way harry felt however that the halfblood prince copy of advanced potionmaking hardly qualified a a textbook the more harry pored over the book the more he realized how much wa in there not only the handy hint and shortcut on potion that were earning him such a glowing reputation with slughorn but also the imaginative little jinx and hex scribbled in the margin which harry wa sure judging by the crossingsout and revision that the prince had invented himself harry had already attempted a few of the prince self invented spell there had been a hex that caused toenail to grow alarmingly fast he had tried this on crabbe in the corridor with very entertaining result a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth which he had twice used to general applause on an unsuspecting argus filch and perhaps most useful of all muffliato a spell that filled the ear of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing so that lengthy conversation could be held in class without being overheard the only person who did not find these charm amusing wa hermione who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if harry had used the muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity sitting up in bed harry turned the book sideways so a to examine more closely the scribbled instruction for a spell that seemed to have caused the prince some trouble there were many crossingsout and alteration but finally crammed into a corner of the page the scribble levicorpus nvbl page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling while the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the window and neville snored loudly harry stared at the letter in bracket nvbl that had to mean nonverbal harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell he wa still having difficulty with nonverbal spell something snape had been quick to comment on in every dada class on the other hand the prince had proved a much more effective teacher than snape so far pointing his wand at nothing in particular he gave it an upward flick and said levicorpusl inside his head aaaaaaaargh there wa a flash of light and the room wa full of voice everyone had woken up a ron had let out a yell harry sent advanced potionmaking flying in panic ron wa dangling upside down in midair a though an invisible hook had hoisted him up by the ankle sorry yelled harry a dean and seamus roared with laughter and neville picked himself up from the floor having fallen out of bed hang on ill let you down he groped for the potion book and riffled through it in a panic trying to find the right page at last he located it and deciphered one cramped word underneath the spell praying that this wa the counterjinx harry thought liberacorpus with all his might there wa another flash of light and ron fell in a heap onto his mattress sorry repeated harry weakly while dean and seamus continued to roar with laughter page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tomorrow said ron in a muffled voice id rather you set the alarm clock by the time they had got dressed padding themselves out with several of mr weasleys handknitted sweater and carrying cloak scarf and glove ron shock had subsided and he had decided that harrys new spell wa highly amusing so amusing in fact that he lost no time in regaling hermione with the story a they sat down for breakfast and then there wa another flash of light and i landed on the bed again ron grinned helping himself to sausage hermione had not cracked a smile during this anecdote and now turned an expression of wintry disapproval upon harry wa this spell by any chance another one from that potion book of yours she asked harry frowned at her always jump to the worst conclusion do not you wa it well yeah it wa but so what so you just decided to try out an unknown handwritten incantation and see what would happen why doe it matter if it handwritten said harry preferring not to answer the rest of the question because it probably not ministry of magic approved said hermione and also she added a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry and ron rolled their eye because i am starting to think this prince character wa a bit dodgy both harry and ron shouted her down at once it wa a laugh said ron upending a ketchup bottle over his sausage just a laugh hermione that is all dangling people upside down by the ankle said hermione who put their time and energy into making up spell like that fred and george said ron shrugging it their kind of thing and er my dad said harry he had only just remembered what said ron and hermione together my dad used this spell said harry i lupin told me this last part wa not true in fact harry had seen his father use the spell on snape but he had never told ron and hermione about that particular excursion into the pensieve now however a wonderful possibility occurred to him could the half blood prince possibly be maybe your dad did use it harry said hermione but he not the only one we have seen a whole bunch of people use it in case you have forgotten dangling people in the air making them float along asleep helpless harry stared at her with a sinking feeling he too remembered the behavior of the death eater at the quidditch world cup ron came to his aid page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that wa different he said robustly they were abusing it harry and his dad were just having a laugh you do not like the prince hermione he added pointing a sausage at her sternly because he better than you at potion it got nothing to do with that said hermione her cheek reddening i just think it very irresponsible to start performing spell when you do not even know what they are for and stop talking about the prince a if it his title i bet it just a stupid nickname and it doe not seem a though he wa a very nice person to me i do not see where you get that from said harry heatedly if he would been a budding death eater he would not have been boasting about being halfblood would he even a he said it harry remembered that his father had been pureblood but he pushed the thought out of his mind he would worry about that later the death eater can not all be pureblood there are not enough pureblood wizard left said hermione stubbornly i expect most of them are halfbloods pretending to be pure it only muggleborns they hate they would be quite happy to let you and ron join up there is no way they would let me be a death eater said ron indignantly a bit of sausage flying off the fork he wa now brandishing at hermione and hitting ernie macmillan on the head my whole family are blood traitor that is a bad a muggleborns to death eater page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and they would love to have me said harry sarcastically wed be best pal if they did not keep trying to do me in this made ron laugh even hermione gave a grudging smile and a distraction arrived in the shape of ginny hey harry i am supposed to give you this it wa a scroll of parchment with harrys name written upon it in familiar thin slanting writing thanks ginny it dumbledores next lesson harry told ron and hermione pulling open the parchment and quickly reading it content monday evening he felt suddenly light and happy want to join u in hogsmeade ginny he asked i am going with dean might see you there she replied waving at them a she left filch wa standing at the oak front door a usual checking off the name of people who had permission to go into hogsmeade the process took even longer than normal a filch wa triplechecking everybody with his secrecy sensor what doe it matter if were smuggling dark stuff out demanded ron eyeing the long thin secrecy sensor with apprehension surely you ought to be checking what we bring back in his cheek earned him a few extra jab with the sensor and he wa still wincing a they stepped out into the wind and sleet the walk into hogsmeade wa not enjoyable harry wrapped his scarf over his lower face the exposed part soon felt both raw and numb the road to the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling village wa full of student bent double against the bitter wind more than once harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room and when they finally reached hogsmeade and saw that zonkos joke shop had been boarded up harry took it a confirmation that this trip wa not destined to be fun ron pointed with a thickly gloved hand toward honeydukes which wa mercifully open and harry and hermione staggered in his wake into the crowded shop thank god shivered ron a they were enveloped by warm toffeescented air let u stay here all afternoon harry mboy said a booming voice from behind them oh no muttered harry the three of them turned to see professor slughorn who wa wearing an enormous furry hat and an overcoat with matching fur collar clutching a large bag of crystalized pineapple and occupying at least a quarter of the shop harry that is three of my little supper you have missed now said slughorn poking him genially in the chest it will not do mboy i am determined to have you miss granger love them do not you yes said hermione helplessly they are really so why do not you come along harry demanded slughorn well i have had quidditch practice professor said harry who had indeed been scheduling practice every time slughorn had sent him a little violet ribbonadorned invitation this strategy meant that page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron wa not left out and they usually had a laugh with ginny imagining hermione shut up with mclaggen and zabini well i certainly expect you to win your first match after all this hard work said slughorn but a little recreation never hurt anybody now how about monday night you can not possibly want to practice in this weather i can not professor i have got er an appointment with professor dumbledore that evening unlucky again cried slughorn dramatically ah well you can not evade me forever harry and with a regal wave he waddled out of the shop taking a little notice of ron a though he had been a display of cockroach cluster i can not believe you have wriggled out of another one said hermione shaking her head they are not that bad you know they are even quite fun sometimes but then she caught sight of ron expression oh look they have got deluxe sugar quill those would last hour glad that hermione had changed the subject harry showed much more interest in the new extralarge sugar quill than he would normally have done but ron continued to look moody and merely shrugged when hermione asked him where he wanted to go next let u go to the three broomstick said harry it will be warm they bundled their scarf back over their face and left the sweetshop the bitter wind wa like knife on page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling their face after the sugary warmth of honeydukes the street wa not very busy nobody wa lingering to chat just hurrying toward their destination the exception were two men a little ahead of them standing just outside the three broomstick one wa very tall and thin squinting through his rainwashed glass harry recognized the barman who worked in the other hogsmeade pub the hog head a harry ron and hermione drew closer the barman drew his cloak more tightly around his neck and walked away leaving the shorter man to fumble with something in his arm they were barely foot from him when harry realized who the man wa mundungus the squat bandylegged man with long straggly ginger hair jumped and dropped an ancient suitcase which burst open releasing what looked like the entire content of a junk shop window oh ello arry said mundungus fletcher with a most unconvincing stab at airiness well do not let me keep ya and he began scrabbling on the ground to retrieve the content of his suitcase with every appearance of a man eager to be gone are you selling this stuff asked harry watching mundungus grab an assortment of grubbylooking object from the ground oh well got to scrape a living said mundungus give me that ron had stooped down and picked up something silver page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hang on ron said slowly this look familiar thank you said mundungus snatching the goblet out of ron hand and stuffing it back into the case well ill see you all ouch harry had pinned mundungus against the wall of the pub by the throat holding him fast with one hand he pulled out his wand harry squealed hermione you took that from sirius house said harry who wa almost nose to nose with mundungus and wa breathing in an unpleasant smell of old tobacco and spirit that had the black family crest on it i no what spluttered mundungus who wa slowly turning purple what did you do go back the night he died and strip the place snarled harry i no give it to me harry you must not shrieked hermione a mundungus started to turn blue there wa a bang and harry felt his hand fly off mundunguss throat gasping and spluttering mundungus seized his fallen case then crack he disapparated harry swore at the top of his voice spinning on the spot to see where mundungus had gone come back you thieving page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there is no point harry tonks had appeared out of nowhere her mousy hair wet with sleet mundungus will probably be in london by now there is no point yelling he nicked sirius stuff nicked it yes but still said tonks who seemed perfectly untroubled by this piece of information you should get out of the cold she watched them go through the door of the three broomstick the moment he wa inside harry burst out he wa nicking sirius stuff i know harry but please do not shout people are staring whispered hermione go and sit down ill get you a drink harry wa still fuming when hermione returned to their table a few minute later holding three bottle of butterbeer can not the order control mundungus harry demanded of the other two in a furious whisper can not they at least stop him stealing everything that is not fixed down when he at headquarters shh said hermione desperately looking around to make sure nobody wa listening there were a couple of warlock sitting close by who were staring at harry with great interest and zabini wa lolling against a pillar not far away harry id be annoyed too i know it your thing he stealing page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry gagged on his butterbeer he had momentarily forgotten that he owned number twelve grimmauld place yeah it my stuff he said no wonder he wa not pleased to see me well i am going to tell dumbledore what is going on he the only one who scare mundungus good idea whispered hermione clearly pleased that harry wa calming down ron what are you staring at nothing said ron hastily looking away from the bar but harry knew he wa trying to catch the eye of the curvy and attractive barmaid madam rosmerta for whom he had long nursed a soft spot i expect nothing in the back getting more firewhisky said hermione waspishly ron ignored this jibe sipping his drink in what he evidently considered to be a dignified silence harry wa thinking about sirius and how he had hated those silver goblet anyway hermione drummed her finger on the table her eye flickering between ron and the bar the moment harry drained the last drop in his bottle she said shall we call it a day and go back to school then the other two nodded it had not been a fun trip and the weather wa getting worse the longer they stayed once again they drew their cloak tightly around them rearranged their scarf pulled on their glove then followed katie bell and a friend out of the pub and back up the high street harrys thought strayed to ginny a they trudged up the road to hogwarts through the frozen slush they had not met up with her undoubtedly thought harry because page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she and dean were cozily closeted in madam puddifoots tea shop that haunt of happy couple scowling he bowed his head against the swirling sleet and trudged on it wa a little while before harry became aware that the voice of katie bell and her friend which were being carried back to him on the wind had become shriller and louder harry squinted at their indistinct figure the two girl were having an argument about something katie wa holding in her hand it nothing to do with you leanne harry heard katie say they rounded a corner in the lane sleet coming thick and fast blurring harrys glass just a he raised a gloved hand to wipe them leanne made to grab hold of the package katie wa holding katie tugged it back and the package fell to the ground at once katie rose into the air not a ron had done suspended comically by the ankle but gracefully her arm outstretched a though she wa about to fly yet there wa something wrong something eerie her hair wa whipped around her by the fierce wind but her eye were closed and her face wa quite empty of expression harry ron hermione and leanne had all halted in their track watching then six foot above the ground katie let out a terrible scream her eye flew open but whatever she could see or whatever she wa feeling wa clearly causing her terrible anguish she screamed and screamed leanne started to scream too and seized katies ankle trying to tug her back to the ground harry ron and hermione rushed forward to help but even a they grabbed katies leg she fell on top of them harry and ron managed to catch her but she wa writhing so much they could hardly hold her page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling instead they lowered her to the ground where she thrashed and screamed apparently unable to recognize any of them harry looked around the landscape seemed deserted stay there he shouted at the others over the howling wind i am going for help he began to sprint toward the school he had never seen anyone behave a katie had just behaved and could not think what had caused it he hurtled around a bend in the lane and collided with what seemed to be an enormous bear on it hind leg hagrid he panted disentangling himself from the hedgerow into which he had fallen harry said hagrid who had sleet trapped in his eyebrow and beard and wa wearing his great shaggy beaverskin coat jus bin visitin grawp he cornin on so well yeh wouldn hagrid someone is hurt back there or cursed or something wha said hagrid bending lower to hear what harry wa saying over the raging wind someone is been cursed bellowed harry cursed who is bin cursed not ron hermione no it not them it katie bell this way together they ran back along the lane it took them no time to find the little group of people around katie who wa still writhing and screaming on the ground page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron hermione and leanne were all trying to quiet her get back shouted hagrid let me see her something is happened to her sobbed leanne i do not know what hagrid stared at katie for a second then without a word bent down scooped her into his arm and ran off toward the castle with her within second katies piercing scream had died away and the only sound wa the roar of the wind hermione hurried over to katies wailing friend and put an arm around her it leanne is not it the girl nodded did it just happen all of a sudden or it wa when that package tore sobbed leanne pointing at the now sodden brownpaper package on the ground which had split open to reveal a greenish glitter ron bent down his hand outstretched but harry seized his arm and pulled him back do not touch if he crouched down an ornate opal necklace wa visible poking out of the paper i have seen that before said harry staring at the thing it wa on display in borgin and burke age ago the label said it wa cursed katie must have touched it he looked up at leanne who had started page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling to shake uncontrollably how did katie get hold of this well that is why we were arguing she came back from the bathroom in the three broomstick holding it said it wa a surprise for somebody at hogwarts and she had to deliver it she looked all funny when she said it oh no oh no i bet she would been imperiused and i did not realize leanne shook with renewed sob hermione patted her shoulder gently she did not say who would given it to her leanne no she would not tell me and i said she wa being stupid and not to take it up to school but she just would not listen and and then i tried to grab it from her and and leanne let out a wail of despair wed better get up to school said hermione her arm still around leanne well be able to find out how she is come on harry hesitated for a moment then pulled his scarf from around his face and ignoring ron gasp carefully covered the necklace in it and picked it up well need to show this to madam pomfrey he said a they followed hermione and leanne up the road harry wa thinking furiously they had just entered the ground when he spoke unable to keep his thought to himself any longer malfoy know about this necklace it wa in a case at borgin and burke four year ago i saw him having a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling good look at it while i wa hiding from him and his dad this is what he wa buying that day when we followed him he remembered it and he went back for it i i do not know harry said ron hesitantly load of people go to borgin and burke and did not that girl say katie got it in the girl bathroom she said she came back from the bathroom with it she did not necessarily get it in the bathroom itself mcgonagall said ron warningly harry looked up sure enough professor mcgonagall wa hurrying down the stone step through swirling sleet to meet them hagrid say you four saw what happened to katie bell upstairs to my office at once please what is that you are holding potter it the thing she touched said harry good lord said professor mcgonagall looking alarmed a she took the necklace from harry no no filch they are with me she added hastily a filch came shuffling eagerly across the entrance hall holding his secrecy sensor aloft take this necklace to professor snape at once but be sure not to touch it keep it wrapped in the scarf harry and the others followed professor mcgonagall upstairs and into her office the sleetspattered window were rattling in their frame and the room wa chilly despite the fire crackling in the grate professor mcgonagall closed the door and swept around her desk to face harry ron hermione and the still sobbing leanne page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well she said sharply what happened haltingly and with many pause while she attempted to control her cry leanne told professor mcgonagall how katie had gone to the bathroom in the three broomstick and returned holding the unmarked package how katie had seemed a little odd and how they had argued about the advisability of agreeing to deliver unknown object the argument culminating in the tussle over the parcel which tore open at this point leanne wa so overcome there wa no getting another word out of her all right said professor mcgonagall not unkindly go up to the hospital wing please leanne and get madam pomfrey to give you something for shock when she had left the room professor mcgonagall turned back to harry ron and hermione what happened when katie touched the necklace she rose up in the air said harry before either ron or hermione could speak and then began to scream and collapsed professor can i see professor dumbledore please the headmaster is away until monday potter said professor mcgonagall looking surprised away harry repeated angrily yes potter away said professor mcgonagall tartly but anything you have to say about this horrible business can be said to me i am sure for a split second harry hesitated professor mcgonagall did not invite confidence dumbledore though in many way more intimidating still seemed page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling le likely to scorn a theory however wild this wa a lifeanddeath matter though and no moment to worry about being laughed at i think draco malfoy gave katie that necklace professor on one side of him ron rubbed his nose in apparent embarrassment on the other hermione shuffled her foot a though quite keen to put a bit of distance between herself and harry that is a very serious accusation potter said professor mcgonagall after a shocked pause do you have any proof no said harry but and he told her about following malfoy to borgin and burke and the conversation they had overheard between him and mr borgin when he had finished speaking professor mcgonagall looked slightly confused malfoy took something to borgin and burke for repair no professor he just wanted borgin to tell him how to mend something he did not have it with him but that is not the point the thing is that he bought something at the same time and i think it wa that necklace you saw malfoy leaving the shop with a similar package no professor he told borgin to keep it in the shop for him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but harry hermione interrupted borgin asked him if he wanted to take it with him and malfoy said no because he did not want to touch it obviously said harry angrily what he actually said wa how would i look carrying that down the street said hermione well he would look a bit of a prat carrying a necklace interjected ron oh ron said hermione despairingly it would be all wrapped up so he would not have to touch it and quite easy to hide inside a cloak so nobody would see it i think whatever he reserved at borgin and burke wa noisy or bulky something he knew would draw attention to him if he carried it down the street and in any case she pressed on loudly before harry could interrupt i asked borgin about the necklace do not you remember when i went in to try and find out what malfoy had asked him to keep i saw it there and borgin just told me the price he did not say it wa already sold or anything well you were being really obvious he realized what you were up to within about five second of course he wa not going to tell you anyway malfoy could have sent off for it since that is enough said professor mcgonagall a hermione opened her mouth to retort looking furious potter i appreciate you telling me this but we can not point the finger of blame at mr malfoy purely because he visited the shop where this necklace might have been purchased the same is probably true of hundred of people page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that is what i said muttered ron and in any case we have put stringent security measure in place this year i do not believe that necklace can possibly have entered this school without our knowledge but and what is more said professor mcgonagall with an air of awful finality mr malfoy wa not in hogsmeade today harry gaped at her deflating how do you know professor because he wa doing detention with me he ha now failed to complete his transfiguration homework twice in a row so thank you for telling me your suspicion potter she said a she marched past them but i need to go up to the hospital wing now to check on katie bell good day to you all she held open her office door they had no choice but to file past her without another word harry wa angry with the other two for siding with mcgonagall nevertheless he felt compelled to join in once they started discussing what had happened so who do you reckon katie wa supposed to give the necklace to asked ron a they climbed the stair to the common room goodness only know said hermione but whoever it wa ha had a narrow escape no one could have opened that package without touching the necklace page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it could have been meant for load of people said harry dumbledore the death eater would love to get rid of him he must be one of their top target or slughorn dumbledore reckons voldemort really wanted him and they can not be pleased that he sided with dumbledore or or you said hermione looking troubled could not have been said harry or katie would have just turned around in the lane and given it to me would not she i wa behind her all the way out of the three broomstick it would have made much more sense to deliver the parcel outside hogwarts what with filch searching everyone who go in and out i wonder why malfoy told her to take it into the castle harry malfoy wa not in hogsmeade said hermione actually stamping her foot in frustration he must have used an accomplice then said harry crabbe or goyle or come to think of it another death eater hell have load better crony than crabbe and goyle now he joined up ron and hermione exchanged look that plainly said there is no point arguing with him dilligrout said hermione firmly a they reached the fat lady the portrait swung open to admit them to the common room it wa quite full and smelled of damp clothing many people seemed to have returned from hogsmeade early because of the bad weather there wa no buzz of fear or speculation however clearly the news of katies fate had not yet spread page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it wa not a very slick attack really when you stop and think about it said ron casually turfing a first year out of one of the good armchair by the fire so that he could sit down the curse did not even make it into the castle not what you would call foolproof you are right said hermione prodding ron out of the chair with her foot and offering it to the first year again it wa not very well thoughtout at all but since when ha malfoy been one of the world great thinker asked harry neither ron nor hermione answered him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the secret riddle katie wa removed to st mungos hospital for magical malady and injury the following day by which time the news that she had been cursed had spread all over the school though the detail were confused and nobody other than harry ron hermione and leanne seemed to know that katie herself had not been the intended target oh and malfoy know of course said harry to ron and hermione who continued their new policy of feigning deafness whenever harry mentioned his malfoyisadeatheater theory harry had wondered whether dumbledore would return from wherever he had been in time for monday night lesson but having had no word to the contrary he presented himself outside dumbledore s office at eight of the clock knocked and wa told to enter there sat dumbledore looking unusually tired his hand wa a black and burned a ever but he smiled when he gestured to harry to sit down the pensieve page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling wa sitting on the desk again casting silvery speck of light over the ceiling you have had a busy time while i have been away dumbledore said i believe you witnessed katies accident yes sir how is she still very unwell although she wa relatively lucky she appears to have brushed the necklace with the smallest possible amount of skin there wa a tiny hole in her glove had she put it on had she even held it in her ungloved hand she would have died perhaps instantly luckily professor snape wa able to do enough to prevent a rapid spread of the curse why him asked harry quickly why not madam pomfrey impertinent said a soft voice from one of the portrait on the wall and phineas nigellus black sirius greatgreatgrandfather raised his head from his arm where he had appeared to be sleeping i would not have permitted a student to question the way hogwarts operated in my day yes thank you phineas said dumbledore quellingly professor snape know much more about the dark art than madam pomfrey harry anyway the st mungos staff are sending me hourly report and i am hopeful that katie will make a full recovery in time where were you this weekend sir harry asked disregarding a strong feeling that he might be pushing his luck a feeling apparently shared by phineas nigellus who hissed softly page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i would rather not say just now said dumbledore however i shall tell you in due course you will said harry startled yes i expect so said dumbledore withdrawing a fresh bottle of silver memory from inside his robe and uncorking it with a prod of his wand sir said harry tentatively i met mundungus in hogsmeade ah yes i am already aware that mundungus ha been treating your inheritance with lightfingered contempt said dumbledore frowning a little he ha gone to ground since you accosted him outside the three broomstick i rather think he dread facing me however rest assured that he will not be making away with any more of sirius old possession that mangy old halfblood ha been stealing black heirloom said phineas nigellus incensed and he stalked out of his frame undoubtedly to visit his portrait in number twelve grimmauld place professor said harry after a short pause did professor mcgonagall tell you what i told her after katie got hurt about draco malfoy she told me of your suspicion yes said dumbledore and do you i shall take all appropriate measure to investigate anyone who might have had a hand in katies accident said dumbledore but what concern me now harry is our lesson page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry felt slightly resentful at this if their lesson were so very important why had there been such a long gap between the first and second however he said no more about draco malfoy but watched a dumbledore poured the fresh memory into the pensieve and began swirling the stone basin once more between his longfingered hand you will remember i am sure that we left the tale of lord voldemorts beginning at the point where the handsome muggle tom riddle had abandoned his witch wife merope and returned to his family home in little hangleton merope wa left alone in london expecting the baby who would one day become lord voldemort how do you know she wa in london sir because of the evidence of one caractacus burke said dumbledore who by an odd coincidence helped found the very shop whence came the necklace we have just been discussing he swilled the content of the pensieve a harry had seen him swill them before much a a gold prospector sifts for gold up out of the swirling silvery mass rose a little old man revolving slowly in the pensieve silver a a ghost but much more solid with a thatch of hair that completely covered his eye yes we acquired it in curious circumstance it wa brought in by a young witch just before christmas oh many year ago now she said she needed the gold badly well that much wa obvious covered in rag and pretty far along going to have a baby see she said the locket had been slytherins well we hear that sort of story all the time oh this wa merlin this wa his favorite teapot but when i looked at it it had his mark all right and a few page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling simple spell were enough to tell me the truth of course that made it near enough priceless she did not seem to have any idea how much it wa worth happy to get ten galleon for it best bargain we ever made dumbledore gave the pensieve an extravigorous shake and caractacus burke descended back into the swirling mass of memory from whence he had come he only gave her ten galleon said harry indignantly caractacus burke wa not famed for his generosity said dumbledore so we know that near the end of her pregnancy merope wa alone in london and in desperate need of gold desperate enough to sell her one and only valuable possession the locket that wa one of marvolos treasured family heirloom but she could do magic said harry impatiently she could have got food and everything for herself by magic could not she ah said dumbledore perhaps she could but it is my belief i am guessing again but i am sure i am right that when her husband abandoned her merope stopped using magic i do not think that she wanted to be a witch any longer of course it is also possible that her unrequited love and the attendant despair sapped her of her power that can happen in any case a you are about to see merope refused to raise her wand even to save her own life she would not even stay alive for her son dumbledore raised his eyebrow could you possibly be feeling sorry for lord voldemort page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no said harry quickly but she had a choice did not she not like my mother your mother had a choice too said dumbledore gently yes merope riddle chose death in spite of a son who needed her but do not judge her too harshly harry she wa greatly weakened by long suffering and she never had your mother courage and now if you will stand where are we going harry asked a dumbledore joined him at the front of the desk this time said dumbledore we are going to enter my memory i think you will find it both rich in detail and satisfyingly accurate after you harry harry bent over the pensieve his face broke the cool surface of the memory and then he wa falling through darkness again second later his foot hit firm ground he opened his eye and found that he and dumbledore were standing in a bustling old fashioned london street there i am said dumbledore brightly pointing ahead of them to a tall figure crossing the road in front of a horsedrawn milk cart this younger albus dumbledore s long hair and beard were auburn having reached their side of the street he strode off along the pavement drawing many curious glance due to the flamboyantly cut suit of plum velvet that he wa wearing nice suit sir said harry before he could stop himself but dumbledore merely chuckled a they followed his younger self a short distance finally passing through a set of iron gate into a bare courtyard that fronted a rather grim square building page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling surrounded by high railing he mounted the few step leading to the front door and knocked once after a moment or two the door wa opened by a scruffy girl wearing an apron good afternoon i have an appointment with a mr cole who i believe is the matron here oh said the bewilderedlooking girl taking in dumbledore s eccentric appearance um just a mo mr cole she bellowed over her shoulder harry heard a distant voice shouting something in response the girl turned back to dumbledore come in she is on er way dumbledore stepped into a hallway tiled in black and white the whole place wa shabby but spotlessly clean harry and the older dumbledore followed before the front door had closed behind them a skinny harassedlooking woman came scurrying toward them she had a sharpfeatured face that appeared more anxious than unkind and she wa talking over her shoulder to another aproned helper a she walked toward dumbledore and take the iodine upstairs to martha billy stubbs ha been picking his scab and eric whalleys oozing all over his sheet chicken pox on top of everything else she said to nobody in particular and then her eye fell upon dumbledore and she stopped dead in her track looking a astonished a if a giraffe had just crossed her threshold good afternoon said dumbledore holding out his hand mr cole simply gaped page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling my name is albus dumbledore i sent you a letter requesting an appointment and you very kindly invited me here today mr cole blinked apparently deciding that dumbledore wa not a hallucination she said feebly oh yes well well then you would better come into my room yes she led dumbledore into a small room that seemed part sitting room part office it wa a shabby a the hallway and the furniture wa old and mismatched she invited dumbledore to sit on a rickety chair and seated herself behind a cluttered desk eyeing him nervously i am here a i told you in my letter to discus tom riddle and arrangement for his future said dumbledore are you family asked mr cole no i am a teacher said dumbledore i have come to offer tom a place at my school what school this then it is called hogwarts said dumbledore and how come you are interested in tom we believe he ha quality we are looking for you mean he won a scholarship how can he have done he never been entered for one well his name ha been down for our school since birth page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling who registered him his parent there wa no doubt that mr cole wa an inconveniently sharp woman apparently dumbledore thought so too for harry now saw him slip his wand out of the pocket of his velvet suit at the same time picking up a piece of perfectly blank paper from mr cole desktop here said dumbledore waving his wand once a he passed her the piece of paper i think this will make everything clear mr cole eye slid out of focus and back again a she gazed intently at the blank paper for a moment that seems perfectly in order she said placidly handing it back then her eye fell upon a bottle of gin and two glass that had certainly not been present a few second before er may i offer you a glass of gin she said in an extrarefined voice thank you very much said dumbledore beaming it soon became clear that mr cole wa no novice when it came to gin drinking pouring both of them a generous measure she drained her own glass in one gulp smacking her lip frankly she smiled at dumbledore for the first time and he did not hesitate to press his advantage i wa wondering whether you could tell me anything of tom riddle history i think he wa born here in the orphanage that is right said mr cole helping herself to more gin i remember it clear a anything because id just page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling started here myself new year eve and bitter cold snowing you know nasty night and this girl not much older than i wa myself at the time came staggering up the front step well she wa not the first we took her in and she had the baby within the hour and she wa dead in another hour mr cole nodded impressively and took another generous gulp of gin did she say anything before she died asked dumbledore anything about the boy father for instance now a it happens she did said mr cole who seemed to be rather enjoying herself now with the gin in her hand and an eager audience for her story i remember she said to me i hope he look like his papa and i will not lie she wa right to hope it because she wa no beauty and then she told me he wa to be named tom for his father and marvolo for her father yes i know funny name is not it we wondered whether she came from a circus and she said the boy surname wa to be riddle and she died soon after that without another word well we named him just a she would said it seemed so important to the poor girl but no tom nor marvolo nor any kind of riddle ever came looking for him nor any family at all so he stayed in the orphanage and he been here ever since mr cole helped herself almost absentmindedly to another healthy measure of gin two pink spot had appeared high on her cheekbone then she said he a funny boy yes said dumbledore i thought he might be page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he wa a funny baby too he hardly ever cried you know and then when he got a little older he wa odd odd in what way asked dumbledore gently well he but mr cole pulled up short and there wa nothing blurry or vague about the inquisitorial glance she shot dumbledore over her gin glass he definitely got a place at your school you say definitely said dumbledore and nothing i say can change that nothing said dumbledore you will be taking him away whatever whatever repeated dumbledore gravely she squinted at him a though deciding whether or not to trust him apparently she decided she could because she said in a sudden rush he scare the other child you mean he is a bully asked dumbledore i think he must be said mr cole frowning slightly but it very hard to catch him at it there have been incident nasty thing dumbledore did not press her though harry could tell that he wa interested she took yet another gulp of gin and her rosy cheek grew rosier still page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling billy stubbs rabbit well tom said he did not do it and i do not see how he could have done but even so it did not hang itself from the rafter did it i should not think so no said dumbledore quietly but i am jiggered if i know how he got up there to do it all i know is he and billy had argued the day before and then mr cole took another swig of gin slopping a little over her chin this time on the summer outing we take them out you know once a year to the countryside or to the seaside well amy benson and dennis bishop were never quite right afterwards and all we ever got out of them wa that they would gone into a cave with tom riddle he swore they would just gone exploring but something happened in there i am sure of it and well there have been a lot of thing funny thing she looked around at dumbledore again and though her cheek were flushed her gaze wa steady i do not think many people will be sorry to see the back of him you understand i am sure that we will not be keeping him permanently said dumbledore he will have to return here at the very least every summer oh well that is better than a whack on the nose with a rusty poker said mr cole with a slight hiccup she got to her foot and harry wa impressed to see that she wa quite steady even though twothirds of the gin wa now gone i suppose you would like to see him very much said dumbledore rising too she led him out of her office and up the stone stair calling out instruction and admonition to helper page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and child a she passed the orphan harry saw were all wearing the same kind of grayish tunic they looked reasonably wellcared for but there wa no denying that this wa a grim place in which to grow up here we are said mr cole a they turned off the second landing and stopped outside the first door in a long corridor she knocked twice and entered tom you have got a visitor this is mr dumberton sorry dunderbore he come to tell you well ill let him do it harry and the two dumbledores entered the room and mr cole closed the door on them it wa a small bare room with nothing in it except an old wardrobe a wooden chair and an iron bedstead a boy wa sitting on top of the gray blanket his leg stretched out in front of him holding a book there wa no trace of the gaunts in tom riddle face merope had got her dying wish he wa his handsome father in miniature tall for eleven year old darkhaired and pale his eye narrowed slightly a he took in dumbledores eccentric appearance there wa a moment silence how do you do tom said dumbledore walking forward and holding out his hand the boy hesitated then took it and they shook hand dumbledore drew up the hard wooden chair beside riddle so that the pair of them looked rather like a hospital patient and visitor i am professor dumbledore page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling professor repeated riddle he looked wary is that like doctor what are you here for did she get you in to have a look at me he wa pointing at the door through which mr cole had just left no no said dumbledore smiling i do not believe you said riddle she want me looked at doe not she tell the truth he spoke the last three word with a ringing force that wa almost shocking it wa a command and it sounded a though he had given it many time before his eye had widened and he wa glaring at dumbledore who made no response except to continue smiling pleasantly after a few second riddle stopped glaring though he looked if anything warier still who are you i have told you my name is professor dumbledore and i work at a school called hogwarts i have come to offer you a place at my school your new school if you would like to come riddle reaction to this wa most surprising he leapt from the bed and backed away from dumbledore looking furious you can not kid me the asylum that is where you are from is not it professor yes of course well i am not going see that old cat the one who should be in the asylum i never did anything to little amy benson or dennis bishop and you can ask them they will tell you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i am not from the asylum said dumbledore patiently i am a teacher and if you will sit down calmly i shall tell you about hogwarts of course if you would rather not come to the school nobody will force you id like to see them try sneered riddle hogwarts dumbledore went on a though he had not heard riddle last word is a school for people with special ability i am not mad i know that you are not mad hogwarts is not a school for mad people it is a school of magic there wa silence riddle had frozen his face expressionless but his eye were flickering back and forth between each of dumbledores a though trying to catch one of them lying magic he repeated in a whisper that is right said dumbledore it it magic what i can do what is it that you can do all sort breathed riddle a flush of excitement wa rising up his neck into his hollow cheek he looked fevered i can make thing move without touching them i can make animal do what i want them to do without training them i can make bad thing happen to people who annoy me i can make them hurt if i want to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling his leg were trembling he stumbled forward and sat down on the bed again staring at his hand his head bowed a though in prayer i knew i wa different he whispered to his own quivering finger i knew i wa special always i knew there wa something well you were quite right said dumbledore who wa no longer smiling but watching riddle intently you are a wizard riddle lifted his head his face wa transfigured there wa a wild happiness upon it yet for some reason it did not make him better looking on the contrary his finely carved feature seemed somehow rougher his expression almost bestial are you a wizard too yes i am prove it said riddle at once in the same commanding tone he had used when he had said tell the truth dumbledore raised his eyebrow if a i take it you are accepting your place at hogwarts of course i am then you will address me a professor or sir riddle expression hardened for the most fleeting moment before he said in an unrecognizably polite voice i am sorry sir i meant please professor could you show me page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry wa sure that dumbledore wa going to refuse that he would tell riddle there would be plenty of time for practical demonstration at hogwarts that they were currently in a building full of muggles and must therefore be cautious to his great surprise however dumbledore drew his wand from an inside pocket of his suit jacket pointed it at the shabby wardrobe in the corner and gave the wand a casual flick the wardrobe burst into flame riddle jumped to his foot harry could hardly blame him for howling in shock and rage all his worldly possession must be in there but even a riddle rounded on dumbledore the flame vanished leaving the wardrobe completely undamaged riddle stared from the wardrobe to dumbledore then his expression greedy he pointed at the wand where can i get one of them all in good time said dumbledore i think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe and sure enough a faint rattling could be heard from inside it for the first time riddle looked frightened open the door said dumbledore riddle hesitated then crossed the room and threw open the wardrobe door on the topmost shelf above a rail of threadbare clothes a small cardboard box wa shaking and rattling a though there were several frantic mouse trapped inside it take it out said dumbledore riddle took down the quaking box he looked unnerved page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling is there anything in that box that you ought not to have asked dumbledore riddle threw dumbledore a long clear calculating look yes i suppose so sir he said finally in an expressionless voice open it said dumbledore riddle took off the lid and tipped the content onto his bed without looking at them harry who had expected something much more exciting saw a mess of small everyday object a yoyo a silver thimble and a tarnished mouth organ among them once free of the box they stopped quivering and lay quite still upon the thin blanket you will return them to their owner with your apology said dumbledore calmly putting his wand back into his jacket i shall know whether it ha been done and be warned thieving is not tolerated at hogwarts riddle did not look remotely abashed he wa still staring coldly and appraisingly at dumbledore at last he said in a colorless voice yes sir at hogwarts dumbledore went on we teach you not only to use magic but to control it you have inadvertently i am sure been using your power in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school you are not the first nor will you be the last to allow your magic to run away with you but you should know that hogwarts can expel student and the ministry of magic yes there is a ministry will punish lawbreaker still more severely all new wizard must accept that in entering our world they abide by our law page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yes sir said riddle again it wa impossible to tell what he wa thinking his face remained quite blank a he put the little cache of stolen object back into the cardboard box when he had finished he turned to dumbledore and said baldly i have not got any money that is easily remedied said dumbledore drawing a leather moneypouch from his pocket there is a fund at hogwarts for those who require assistance to buy book and robe you might have to buy some of your spellbooks and so on secondhand but where do you buy spellbooks interrupted riddle who had taken the heavy money bag without thanking dumbledore and wa now examining a fat gold galleon in diagon alley said dumbledore i have your list of book and school equipment with me i can help you find everything you are coming with me asked riddle looking up certainly if you i do not need you said riddle i am used to doing thing for myself i go round london on my own all the time how do you get to this diagon alley sir he added catching dumbledore s eye harry thought that dumbledore would insist upon accompanying riddle but once again he wa surprised dumbledore handed riddle the envelope containing his list of equipment and after telling riddle exactly how to get to the leaky cauldron from the orphanage he said you will be able to see it although muggles around you nonmagical people page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that is will not ask for tom the barman easy enough to remember a he share your name riddle gave an irritable twitch a though trying to displace an irksome fly you dislike the name tom there are a lot of tom muttered riddle then a though he could not suppress the question a though it burst from him in spite of himself he asked wa my father a wizard he wa called tom riddle too they have told me i am afraid i do not know said dumbledore his voice gentle my mother can not have been magic or she would not have died said riddle more to himself than dumbledore it must have been him so when i have got all my stuff when do i come to this hogwarts all the detail are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope said dumbledore you will leave from king cross station on the first of september there is a train ticket in there too riddle nodded dumbledore got to his foot and held out his hand again taking it riddle said i can speak to snake i found out when we have been to the country on trip they find me they whisper to me is that normal for a wizard harry could tell that he had withheld mention of this strangest power until that moment determined to impress it is unusual said dumbledore after a moment hesitation but not unheard of page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling his tone wa casual but his eye moved curiously over riddle face they stood for a moment man and boy staring at each other then the handshake wa broken dumbledore wa at the door goodbye tom i shall see you at hogwarts i think that will do said the whitehaired dumbledore at harrys side and second later they were soaring weightlessly through darkness once more before landing squarely in the presentday office sit down said dumbledore landing beside harry harry obeyed his mind still full of what he had just seen he believed it much quicker than i did i mean when you told him he wa a wizard said harry i did not believe hagrid at first when he told me yes riddle wa perfectly ready to believe that he wa to use his word special said dumbledore did you know then asked harry did i know that i had just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time said dumbledore no i had no idea that he wa to grow up to be what he is however i wa certainly intrigued by him i returned to hogwarts intending to keep an eye upon him something i should have done in any case given that he wa alone and friendless but which already i felt i ought to do for others sake a much a his his power a you heard were surprisingly well developed for such a young wizard and most interestingly and ominously of all he had already page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling discovered that he had some measure of control over them and begun to use them consciously and a you saw they were not the random experiment typical of young wizard he wa already using magic against other people to frighten to punish to control the little story of the strangled rabbit and the young boy and girl he lured into a cave were most suggestive i can make them hurt if i want to and he wa a parselmouth interjected harry yes indeed a rare ability and one supposedly connected with the dark art although a we know there are parselmouths among the great and the good too in fact his ability to speak to serpent did not make me nearly a uneasy a his obvious instinct for cruelty secrecy and domination time is making fool of u again said dumbledore indicating the dark sky beyond the window but before we part i want to draw your attention to certain feature of the scene we have just witnessed for they have a great bearing on the matter we shall be discussing in future meeting firstly i hope you noticed riddle reaction when i mentioned that another shared his first name tom harry nodded there he showed his contempt for anything that tied him to other people anything that made him ordinary even then he wished to be different separate notorious he she would his name a you know within a few short year of that conversation and created the mask of lord voldemort behind which he ha been hidden for so long page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i trust that you also noticed that tom riddle wa already highly selfsufficient secretive and apparently friendless he did not want help or companionship on his trip to diagon alley he preferred to operate alone the adult voldemort is the same you will hear many of his death eater claiming that they are in his confidence that they alone are close to him even understand him they are deluded lord voldemort ha never had a friend nor do i believe that he ha ever wanted one and lastly i hope you are not too sleepy to pay attention to this harry the young tom riddle liked to collect trophy you saw the box of stolen article he had hidden in his room these were taken from victim of his bullying behavior souvenir if you will of particularly unpleasant bit of magic bear in mind this magpielike tendency for this particularly will be important later and now it really is time for bed harry got to his foot a he walked across the room his eye fell upon the little table on which marvolo gaunts ring had rested last time but the ring wa no longer there yes harry said dumbledore for harry had come to a halt the ring gone said harry looking around but i thought you might have the mouth organ or something dumbledore beamed at him peering over the top of his halfmoon spectacle very astute harry but the mouth organ wa only ever a mouth organ page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and on that enigmatic note he waved to harry who understood himself to be dismissed page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling felix felicis harry had herbology first thing the following morning he had been unable to tell ron and hermione about his lesson with dumbledore over breakfast for fear of being overheard but he filled them in a they walked across the vegetable patch toward the greenhouse the weekend brutal wind had died out at last the weird mist had returned and it took them a little longer than usual to find the correct greenhouse wow scary thought the boy youknowwho said ron quietly a they took their place around one of the gnarled snargaluff stump that formed this term project and began pulling on their protective glove but i still do not get why dumbledores showing you all this i mean it really interesting and everything but what is the point do not know said harry inserting a gum shield but he say it all important and it will help me survive page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i think it fascinating said hermione earnestly it make absolute sense to know a much about voldemort a possible how else will you find out his weakness so how wa slughorns latest party harry asked her thickly through the gum shield oh it wa quite fun really said hermione now putting on protective goggles i mean he drone on about famous expupils a bit and he absolutely fawn on mclaggen because he so wellconnected but he gave u some really nice food and he introduced u to gwenog jones gwenog jones said ron his eye widening under his own goggles the gwenog jones captain of the holyhead harpy that is right said hermione personally i thought she wa a bit full of herself but quite enough chat over here said professor sprout briskly bustling over and looking stern you are lagging behind everybody else ha started and nevilles already got his first pod they looked around sure enough there sat neville with a bloody lip and several nasty scratch along the side of his face but clutching an unpleasantly pulsating green object about the size of a grapefruit okay professor were starting now said ron adding quietly when she had turned away again should have used muffliato harry no we should not said hermione at once looking a she always did intensely cross at the thought of the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling halfblood prince and his spell well come on wed better get going she gave the other two an apprehensive look they all took deep breath and then dived at the gnarled stump between them it sprang to life at once long prickly bramblelike vine flew out of the top and whipped through the air one tangled itself in hermiones hair and ron beat it back with a pair of secateurs harry succeeded in trapping a couple of vine and knotting them together a hole opened in the middle of all the tentaclelike branch hermione plunged her arm bravely into this hole which closed like a trap around her elbow harry and ron tugged and wrenched at the vine forcing the hole to open again and hermione snatched her arm free clutching in her finger a pod just like nevilles at once the prickly vine shot back inside and the gnarled stump sat there looking like an innocently dead lump of wood you know i do not think ill be having any of these in my garden when i have got my own place said ron pushing his goggles up onto his forehead and wiping sweat from his face pas me a bowl said hermione holding the pulsating pod at arm length harry handed one over and she dropped the pod into it with a look of disgust on her face do not be squeamish squeeze it out they are best when they are fresh called professor sprout anyway said hermione continuing their interrupted conversation a though a lump of wood had not just attacked them slughorns going to have a christmas party harry and there is no way you will be page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evening so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come harry groaned meanwhile ron who wa attempting to burst the pod in the bowl by putting both hand on it standing up and squashing it a hard a he could said angrily and this is another party just for slughorns favorite is it just for the slug club yes said hermione the pod flew out from under ron finger and hit the greenhouse glass rebounding onto the back of professor sprout head and knocking off her old patched hat harry went to retrieve the pod when he got back hermione wa saying look did not make up the name slug club slug club repeated ron with a sneer worthy of malfoy it pathetic well i hope you enjoy your party why do not you try hooking up with mclaggen then slughorn can make you king and queen slug were allowed to bring guest said hermione who for some reason had turned a bright boiling scarlet and i wa going to ask you to come but if you think it that stupid then i will not bother harry suddenly wished the pod had flown a little farther so that he need not have been sitting here with the pair of them unnoticed by either he seized the bowl that contained the pod and began to try and open it by the noisiest and most energetic mean he could think of unfortunately he could still hear every word of their conversation page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you were going to ask me asked ron in a completely different voice yes said hermione angrily but obviously if you would rather i hooked up with mclaggen there wa a pause while harry continued to pound the resilient pod with a trowel no i would not said ron in a very quiet voice harry missed the pod hit the bowl and shattered it reparo he said hastily poking the piece with his wand and the bowl sprang back together again the crash however appeared to have awoken ron and hermione to harrys presence hermione looked flustered and immediately started fussing about for her copy of flesheating tree of the world to find out the correct way to juice snargaluff pod ron on the other hand looked sheepish but also rather pleased with himself hand that over harry said hermione hurriedly it say were supposed to puncture them with something sharp harry passed her the pod in the bowl he and ron both snapped their goggles back over their eye and dived once more for the stump it wa not a though he wa really surprised thought harry a he wrestled with a thorny vine intent upon throttling him he had had an inkling that this might happen sooner or later but he wa not sure how he felt about it he and cho were now too embarrassed to look at each other let alone talk to each other what if ron and hermione started going out together then split up could their friendship page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling survive it harry remembered the few week when they had not been talking to each other in the third year he had not enjoyed trying to bridge the distance between them and then what if they did not split up what if they became like bill and fleur and it became excruciatingly embarrassing to be in their presence so that he wa shut out for good gotcha yelled ron pulling a second pod from the stump just a hermione managed to burst the first one open so that the bowl wa full of tuber wriggling like pale green worm the rest of the lesson passed without further mention of slughorns party although harry watched his two friend more closely over the next few day ron and hermione did not seem any different except that they were a little politer to each other than usual harry supposed he would just have to wait to see what happened under the influence of butterbeer in slughorns dimly lit room on the night of the party in the meantime however he had more pressing worry katie bell wa still in st mungos hospital with no prospect of leaving which meant that the promising gryffindor team harry had been training so carefully since september wa one chaser short he kept putting off replacing katie in the hope that she would return but their opening match against slytherin wa looming and he finally had to accept that she would not be back in time to play harry did not think he could stand another full house tryout with a sinking feeling that had little to do with quidditch he cornered dean thomas after transfiguration one day most of the class had already left although several twittering yellow bird were still zooming around the room all of hermione s page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling creation nobody else had succeeded in conjuring so much a a feather from thin air are you still interested in playing chaser wha yeah of course said dean excitedly over dean shoulder harry saw seamus finnigan slamming his book into his bag looking sour one of the reason why harry would have preferred not to have to ask dean to play wa that he knew seamus would not like it on the other hand he had to do what wa best for the team and dean had outflown seamus at the tryout well then you are in said harry there is a practice tonight seven of the clock right said dean cheer harry blimey i can not wait to tell ginny he sprinted out of the room leaving harry and seamus alone together an uncomfortable moment made no easier when a bird dropping landed on seamuss head a one of hermiones canary whizzed over them seamus wa not the only person disgruntled by the choice of katies substitute there wa much muttering in the common room about the fact that harry had now chosen two of his classmate for the team a harry had endured much worse muttering than this in his school career he wa not particularly bothered but all the same the pressure wa increasing to provide a win in the upcoming match against slytherin if gryffindor won harry knew that the whole house would forget that they had criticized him and swear that they had always known it wa a great team if they lost well harry thought wryly he had still endured worse muttering page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry had no reason to regret his choice once he saw dean fly that evening he worked well with ginny and demelza the beater peakes and coote were getting better all the time the only problem wa ron harry had known all along that ron wa an inconsistent player who suffered from nerve and a lack of confidence and unfortunately the looming prospect of the opening game of the season seemed to have brought out all his old insecurity after letting in half a dozen goal most of them scored by ginny his technique became wilder and wilder until he finally punched an oncoming demelza robin in the mouth it wa an accident i am sorry demelza really sorry ron shouted after her a she zigzagged back to the ground dripping blood everywhere i just panicked ginny said angrily landing next to demelza and examining her fat lip you prat ron look at the state of her i can fix that said harry landing beside the two girl pointing his wand at demelzas mouth and saying episkey and ginny do not call ron a prat you are not the captain of this team well you seemed too busy to call him a prat and i thought someone should harry forced himself not to laugh in the air everyone let u go overall it wa one of the worst practice they had had all term though harry did not feel that honesty wa the best policy when they were this close to the match page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling good work everyone i think well flatten slytherin he said bracingly and the chaser and beater left the changing room looking reasonably happy with themselves i played like a sack of dragon dung said ron in a hollow voice when the door had swung shut behind ginny no you did not said harry firmly you are the best keeper i tried out ron your only problem is nerve he kept up a relentless flow of encouragement all the way back to the castle and by the time they reached the second floor ron wa looking marginally more cheerful when harry pushed open the tapestry to take their usual shortcut up to gryffindor tower however they found themselves looking at dean and ginny who were locked in a close embrace and kissing fiercely a though glued together it wa a though something large and scaly erupted into life in harrys stomach clawing at his inside hot blood seemed to flood his brain so that all thought wa extinguished replaced by a savage urge to jinx dean into a jelly wrestling with this sudden madness he heard ron voice a though from a great distance away oi dean and ginny broke apart and looked around what said ginny i do not want to find my own sister snogging people in public page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling this wa a deserted corridor till you came butting in said ginny dean wa looking embarrassed he gave harry a shifty grin that harry did not return a the newborn monster inside him wa roaring for dean instant dismissal from the team er cmon ginny said dean let u go back to the common room you go said ginny i want a word with my dear brother dean left looking a though he wa not sorry to depart the scene right said ginny tossing her long red hair out of her face and glaring at ron let u get this straight once and for all it is none of your business who i go out with or what i do with them ron yeah it is said ron just a angrily dyou think i want people saying my sister a a what shouted ginny drawing her wand a what exactly he doe not mean anything ginny said harry automatically though the monster wa roaring it approval of ron word oh yes he doe she said flaring up at harry just because he never snogged anyone in his life just because the best kiss he ever had is from our auntie muriel shut your mouth bellowed ron bypassing red and turning maroon page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no i will not yelled ginny beside herself i have seen you with phlegm hoping she will kiss you on the cheek every time you see her it pathetic if you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself you would not mind so much that everyone else doe it ron had pulled out his wand too harry stepped swiftly between them you do not know what you are talking about ron roared trying to get a clear shot at ginny around harry who wa now standing in front of her with his arm outstretched just because i do not do it in public ginny screamed with derisive laughter trying to push harry out of the way been kissing pigwidgeon have you or have you got a picture of auntie muriel stashed under your pillow you a streak of orange light flew under harrys left arm and missed ginny by inch harry pushed ron up against the wall do not be stupid harrys snogged cho chang shouted ginny who sounded close to tear now and hermione snogged viktor krum it only you who act like it something disgusting ron and that is because you have got about a much experience a a twelveyearold and with that she stormed away harry quickly let go of ron the look on his face wa murderous they both stood there breathing heavily until mr norris page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling filch s cat appeared around the corner which broke the tension cmon said harry a the sound of filch s shuffling foot reached their ear they hurried up the stair and along a seventhfloor corridor oi out of the way ron barked at a small girl who jumped in fright and dropped a bottle of toadspawn harry hardly noticed the sound of shattering glass he felt disoriented dizzy being struck by a lightning bolt must be something like this it just because she is ron sister he told himself you just did not like seeing her kissing dean because she is ron sister but unbidden into his mind came an image of that same deserted corridor with himself kissing ginny instead the monster in his chest purred but then he saw ron ripping open the tapestry curtain and drawing his wand on harry shouting thing like betrayal of trust supposed to be my friend dyou think hermione did snog krum ron asked abruptly a they approached the fat lady harry gave a guilty start and wrenched his imagination away from a corridor in which no ron intruded in which he and ginny were quite alone what he said confusedly oh er the honest answer wa yes but he did not want to give it however ron seemed to gather the worst from the look on harrys face dilligrout he said darkly to the fat lady and they climbed through the portrait hole into the common room page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling neither of them mentioned ginny or hermione again indeed they barely spoke to each other that evening and got into bed in silence each absorbed in his own thought harry lay awake for a long time looking up at the canopy of his fourposter and trying to convince himself that his feeling for ginny were entirely elder brotherly they had lived had they not like brother and sister all summer playing quidditch teasing ron and having a laugh about bill and phlegm he had known ginny for year now it wa natural that he should feel protective natural that he should want to look out for her want to rip dean limb from limb for kissing her no he would have to control that particular brotherly feeling ron gave a great grunting snore she is ron sister harry told himself firmly ron sister she is outofbounds he would not risk his friendship with ron for anything he punched his pillow into a more comfortable shape and waited for sleep to come trying his utmost not to allow his thought to stray anywhere near ginny harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed and confused by a series of dream in which ron had chased him with a beater bat but by midday he would have happily exchanged the dream ron for the real one who wa not only coldshouldering ginny and dean but also treating a hurt and bewildered hermione with an icy sneering indifference what wa more ron seemed to have become overnight a touchy and ready to lash out a the average blast ended skrewt harry spent the day attempting to keep the peace between ron and hermione with no success finally hermione departed for bed in high dudgeon and ron stalked off to the boy dormitory page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling after swearing angrily at several frightened first year for looking at him to harrys dismay ron new aggression did not wear off over the next few day worse still it coincided with an even deeper dip in his keeping skill which made him still more aggressive so that during the final quidditch practice before saturday match he failed to save every single goal the chaser aimed at him but bellowed at everybody so much that he reduced demelza robin to tear you shut up and leave her alone shouted peakes who wa about twothirds ron height though admittedly carrying a heavy bat enough bellowed harry who had seen ginny glowering in ron direction and remembering her reputation a an accomplished caster of the bat bogey hex soared over to intervene before thing got out of hand peakes go and pack up the bludgers demelza pull yourself together you played really well today ron he waited until the rest of the team were out of earshot before saying it you are my best mate but carry on treating the rest of them like this and i am going to kick you off the team he really thought for a moment that ron might hit him but then something much worse happened ron seemed to sag on his broom all the fight went out of him and he said i resign i am pathetic you are not pathetic and you are not resigning said harry fiercely seizing ron by the front of his robe you can save anything when you are on form it a mental problem you have got you calling me mental page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yeah maybe i am they glared at each other for a moment then ron shook his head wearily i know you have not got any time to find another keeper so ill play tomorrow but if we lose and we will i am taking myself off the team nothing harry said made any difference he tried boosting ron confidence all through dinner but ron wa too busy being grumpy and surly with hermione to notice harry persisted in the common room that evening but his assertion that the whole team would be devastated if ron left wa somewhat undermined by the fact that the rest of the team wa sitting in a huddle in a distant corner clearly muttering about ron and casting him nasty look finally harry tried getting angry again in the hope of provoking ron into a defiant and hopefully goalsaving attitude but this strategy did not appear to work any better than encouragement ron went to bed a dejected and hopeless a ever harry lay awake for a very long time in the darkness he did not want to lose the upcoming match not only wa it his first a captain but he wa determined to beat draco malfoy at quidditch even if he could not yet prove his suspicion about him yet if ron played a he had done in the last few practice their chance of winning were very slim if only there wa something he could do to make ron pull himself together make him play at the top of his form something that would ensure that ron had a really good day and the answer came to harry in one sudden glorious stroke of inspiration page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling breakfast wa the usual excitable affair next morning the slytherins hissed and booed loudly a every member of the gryffindor team entered the great hall harry glanced at the ceiling and saw a clear pale blue sky a good omen the gryffindor table a solid mass of red and gold cheered a harry and ron approached harry grinned and waved ron grimaced weakly and shook his head cheer up ron called lavender i know you will be brilliant ron ignored her tea harry asked him coffee pumpkin juice anything said ron glumly taking a moody bite of toast a few minute later hermione who had become so tired of ron recent unpleasant behavior that she had not come down to breakfast with them paused on her way up the table how are you both feeling she asked tentatively her eye on the back of ron head fine said harry who wa concentrating on handing ron a glass of pumpkin juice there you go ron drink up ron had just raised the glass to his lip when hermione spoke sharply do not drink that ron both harry and ron looked up at her page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling why not said ron hermione wa now staring at harry a though she could not believe her eye you just put something in that drink excuse me said harry you heard me i saw you you just tipped something into ron drink you have got the bottle in your hand right now i do not know what you are talking about said harry stowing the little bottle hastily in his pocket ron i warn you do not drink it hermione said again alarmed but ron picked up the glass drained it in one gulp and said stop bossing me around hermione she looked scandalized bending low so that only harry could hear her she hissed you should be expelled for that id never have believed it of you harry hark who is talking he whispered back confunded anyone lately she stormed up the table away from them harry watched her go without regret hermione had never really understood what a serious business quidditch wa he then looked around at ron who wa smacking his lip nearly time said harry blithely the frosty grass crunched underfoot a they strode down to the stadium page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling pretty lucky the weather this good eh harry asked ron yeah said ron who wa pale and sicklooking ginny and demelza were already wearing their quidditch robe and waiting in the changing room condition look ideal said ginny ignoring ron and guess what that slytherin chaser vaisey he took a bludger in the head yesterday during their practice and he too sore to play and even better than that malfoys gone off sick too what said harry wheeling around to stare at her he ill what is wrong with him no idea but it great for u said ginny brightly they are playing harper instead he in my year and he an idiot harry smiled back vaguely but a he pulled on his scarlet robe his mind wa far from quidditch malfoy had once before claimed he could not play due to injury but on that occasion he had made sure the whole match wa rescheduled for a time that suited the slytherins better why wa he now happy to let a substitute go on wa he really ill or wa he faking fishy is not it he said in an undertone to ron malfoy not playing lucky i call it said ron looking slightly more animated and vaisey off too he their best goal scorer i did not fancy hey he said suddenly freezing halfway through pulling on his keeper glove and staring at harry what page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i you ron had dropped his voice he looked both scared and excited my drink my pumpkin juice you did not harry raised his eyebrow but said nothing except well be starting in about five minute you would better get your boot on they walked out onto the pitch to tumultuous roar and boo one end of the stadium wa solid red and gold the other a sea of green and silver many hufflepuffs and ravenclaws had taken side too amidst all the yelling and clapping harry could distinctly hear the roar of luna lovegoods famous liontopped hat harry stepped up to madam hooch the referee who wa standing ready to release the ball from the crate captain shake hand she said and harry had his hand crushed by the new slytherin captain urquhart mount your broom on the whistle three two one the whistle sounded harry and the others kicked off hard from the frozen ground and they were away harry soared around the perimeter of the ground looking around for the snitch and keeping one eye on harper who wa zigzagging far below him then a voice that wa jarringly different to the usual commentator started up well there they go and i think were all surprised to see the team that potter put together this year many thought given ronald weasleys patchy performance a keeper last year that he might be off the team but of course a close personal friendship with the captain doe help page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling these word were greeted with jeer and applause from the slytherin end of the pitch harry craned around on his broom to look toward the commentator podium a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose wa standing there talking into the magical megaphone that had once been lee jordan harry recognized zacharias smith a hufflepuff player whom he heartily disliked oh and here come slytherin s first attempt on goal it urquhart streaking down the pitch and harrys stomach turned over weasley save it well he bound to get lucky sometimes i suppose that is right smith he is muttered harry grinning to himself a he dived amongst the chaser with his eye searching all around for some hint of the elusive snitch with half an hour of the game gone gryffindor were leading sixty point to zero ron having made some truly spectacular save some by the very tip of his glove and ginny having scored four of gryffindors six goal this effectively stopped zacharias wondering loudly whether the two weasleys were only there because harry liked them and he started on peakes and coote instead of course coote is not really the usual build for a beater said zacharias loftily they have generally got a bit more muscle hit a bludger at him harry called to coote a he zoomed past but coote grinning broadly chose to aim the next bludger at harper instead who wa just passing harry in the opposite direction harry wa page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling pleased to hear the dull thunk that meant the bludger had found it mark it seemed a though gryffindor could do no wrong again and again they scored and again and again at the other end of the pitch ron saved goal with apparent ease he wa actually smiling now and when the crowd greeted a particularly good save with a rousing chorus of the old favorite weasley is our king he pretended to conduct them from on high think he something special today doe not he said a snide voice and harry wa nearly knocked off his broom a harper collided with him hard and deliberately your bloodtraitor pal madam hooch back wa turned and though gryffindors below shouted in anger by the time she looked around harper had already sped off his shoulder aching harry raced after him determined to ram him back and i think harper of slytherins seen the snitch said zacharias smith through his megaphone yes he certainly seen something potter ha not smith really wa an idiot thought harry had not he noticed them collide but next moment his stomach seemed to drop out of the sky smith wa right and harry wa wrong harper had not sped upward at random he had spotted what harry had not the snitch wa speeding along high above them glinting brightly against the clear blue sky harry accelerated the wind wa whistling in his ear so that it drowned all sound of smith commentary or the crowd but harper wa still ahead of him and gryffindor wa only a hundred point up if harper page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling got there first gryffindor had lost and now harper wa foot from it his hand outstretched oi harper yelled harry in desperation how much did malfoy pay you to come on instead of him he did not know what made him say it but harper did a doubletake he fumbled the snitch let it slip through his finger and shot right past it harry made a great swipe for the tiny fluttering ball and caught it yes harry yelled wheeling around he hurtled back toward the ground the snitch held high in his hand a the crowd realized what had happened a great shout went up that almost drowned the sound of the whistle that signaled the end of the game ginny where re you going yelled harry who had found himself trapped in the midst of a mass midair hug with the rest of the team but ginny sped right on past them until with an almighty crash she collided with the commentator podium a the crowd shrieked and laughed the gryffindor team landed beside the wreckage of wood under which zacharias wa feebly stirring harry heard ginny saying blithely to an irate professor mcgonagall forgot to brake professor sorry laughing harry broke free of the rest of the team and hugged ginny but let go very quickly avoiding her gaze he clapped a cheering ron on the back instead a all enmity forgotten the gryffindor team left the pitch arm in arm punching the air and waving to their supporter the atmosphere in the changing room wa jubilant page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling party up in the common room seamus said yelled dean exuberantly cmon ginny demelza ron and harry were the last two in the changing room they were just about to leave when hermione entered she wa twisting her gryffindor scarf in her hand and looked upset but determined i want a word with you harry she took a deep breath you should not have done it you heard slughorn it illegal what are you going to do turn u in demanded ron what are you two talking about asked harry turning away to hang up his robe so that neither of them would see him grinning you know perfectly well what were talking about said hermione shrilly you spiked ron juice with lucky potion at breakfast felix felicis no i did not said harry turning back to face them both yes you did harry and that is why everything went right there were slytherin player missing and ron saved everything i did not put it in said harry grinning broadly he slipped his hand inside his jacket pocket and drew out the tiny bottle that hermione had seen in his hand that morning it wa full of golden potion and the cork wa still tightly sealed with wax i wanted ron to think id done it so i faked it when i knew you were looking he looked at ron you saved everything because you felt lucky you did it all yourself page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he pocketed the potion again there really wa not anything in my pumpkin juice ron said astounded but the weather good and vaisey could not play i honestly have not been given lucky potion harry shook his head ron gaped at him for a moment then rounded on hermione imitating her voice you added felix felicis to ron juice this morning that is why he saved every thing see i can save goal without help hermione i never said you could not ron you thought you would been given it too but ron had already strode past her out of the door with his broomstick over his shoulder er said harry into the sudden silence he had not expected his plan to backfire like this shall shall we go up to the party then you go said hermione blinking back tear i am sick of ron at the moment i do not know what i am supposed to have done and she stormed out of the changing room too harry walked slowly back up the ground toward the castle through the crowd many of whom shouted congratulation at him but he felt a great sense of letdown he had been sure that if ron won the match he and hermione would be friend again immediately he did not see how he could possibly explain to hermione that what she had done to offend ron wa kiss viktor krum not when the offense had occurred so long ago page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry could not see hermione at the gryffindor celebration party which wa in full swing when he arrived renewed cheer and clapping greeted his appearance and he wa soon surrounded by a mob of people congratulating him what with trying to shake off the creevey brother who wanted a blowbyblow match analysis and the large group of girl that encircled him laughing at his least amusing comment and batting their eyelid it wa some time before he could try and find ron at last he extricated himself from romilda vane who wa hinting heavily that she would like to go to slughorns christmas party with him a he wa ducking toward the drink table he walked straight into ginny arnold the pygmy puff riding on her shoulder and crookshanks mewing hopefully at her heel looking for ron she asked smirking he over there the filthy hypocrite harry looked into the corner she wa indicating there in full view of the whole room stood ron wrapped so closely around lavender brown it wa hard to tell whose hand were whose it look like he eating her face doe not it said ginny dispassionately but i suppose he got to refine his technique somehow good game harry she patted him on the arm harry felt a swooping sensation in his stomach but then she walked off to help herself to more butterbeer crookshanks trotted after her his yellow eye fixed upon arnold harry turned away from ron who did not look like he would be surfacing soon just a the portrait hole wa closing with a sinking feeling he thought he saw a mane of bushy brown hair whipping out of sight page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he darted forward sidestepped romilda vane again and pushed open the portrait of the fat lady the corridor outside seemed to be deserted hermione he found her in the first unlocked classroom he tried she wa sitting on the teacher desk alone except for a small ring of twittering yellow bird circling her head which she had clearly just conjured out of midair harry could not help admiring her spellwork at a time like this oh hello harry she said in a brittle voice i wa just practicing yeah they are er really good said harry he had no idea what to say to her he wa just wondering whether there wa any chance that she had not noticed ron that she had merely left the room because the party wa a little too rowdy when she said in an unnaturally highpitched voice ron seems to be enjoying the celebration er doe he said harry do not pretend you did not see him said hermione he wa not exactly hiding it wa the door behind them burst open to harrys horror ron came in laughing pulling lavender by the hand oh he said drawing up short at the sight of harry and hermione oops said lavender and she backed out of the room giggling the door swung shut behind her page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there wa a horrible swelling billowing silence hermione wa staring at ron who refused to look at her but said with an odd mixture of bravado and awkwardness hi harry wondered where you would got to hermione slid off the desk the little flock of golden bird continued to twitter in circle around her head so that she looked like a strange feathery model of the solar system you should not leave lavender waiting outside she said quietly she will wonder where you have gone she walked very slowly and erectly toward the door harry glanced at ron who wa looking relieved that nothing worse had happened oppugno came a shriek from the doorway harry spun around to see hermione pointing her wand at ron her expression wild the little flock of bird wa speeding like a hail of fat golden bullet toward ron who yelped and covered his face with his hand but the bird attacked pecking and clawing at every bit of flesh they could reach gerremoffme he yelled but with one last look of vindictive fury hermione wrenched open the door and disappeared through it harry thought he heard a sob before it slammed page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the unbreakable vow snow wa swirling against the icy window once more christmas wa approaching fast hagrid had already singlehandedly delivered the usual twelve christmas tree for the great hall garland of holly and tinsel had been twisted around the banister of the stair everlasting candle glowed from inside the helmet of suit of armor and great bunch of mistletoe had been hung at interval along the corridor large group of girl tended to converge underneath the mistletoe bunch every time harry went past which caused blockage in the corridor fortunately however harrys frequent nighttime wandering had given him an unusually good knowledge of the castle secret passageway so that he wa able without too much difficulty to navigate mistletoefree route between class ron who might once have found the necessity of these detour a because for jealousy rather than hilarity simply roared with laughter about it all although harry much preferred this new laughing page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling joking ron to the moody aggressive model he had been enduring for the last few week the improved ron came at a heavy price firstly harry had to put up with the frequent presence of lavender brown who seemed to regard any moment that she wa not kissing ron a a moment wasted and secondly harry found himself once more the best friend of two people who seemed unlikely ever to speak to each other again ron whose hand and forearm still bore scratch and cut from hermiones bird attack wa taking a defensive and resentful tone she can not complain he told harry she snogged krum so she is found out someone want to snog me too well it a free country i have not done anything wrong harry did not answer but pretended to be absorbed in the book they were supposed to have read before charm next morning quintessence a quest determined a he wa to remain friend with both ron and hermione he wa spending a lot of time with his mouth shut tight i never promised hermione anything ron mumbled i mean all right i wa going to go to slughorns christmas party with her but she never said just a friend i am a free agent harry turned a page of quintessence aware that ron wa watching him ron voice tailed away in mutter barely audible over the loud crackling of the fire though harry thought he caught the word krum and can not complain again hermiones schedule wa so full that harry could only talk to her properly in the evening when ron wa in page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling any case so tightly wrapped around lavender that he did not notice what harry wa doing hermione refused to sit in the common room while ron wa there so harry generally joined her in the library which meant that their conversation were held in whisper he at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he like said hermione while the librarian madam pince prowled the shelf behind them i really could not care le she raised her quill and dotted an i so ferociously that she punctured a hole in her parchment harry said nothing he thought his voice might soon vanish from lack of use he bent a little lower over advanced potionmaking and continued to make note on everlasting elixir occasionally pausing to decipher the prince useful addition to libatius borage text and incidentally said hermione after a few moment you need to be careful for the last time said harry speaking in a slightly hoarse whisper after threequarters of an hour of silence i am not giving back this book i have learned more from the halfblood prince than snape or slughorn have taught me in i am not talking about your stupid socalled prince said hermione giving his book a nasty look a though it had been rude to her i am talking about earlier i went into the girl bathroom just before i came in here and there were about a dozen girl in there including that romilda vane trying to decide how to slip you a love potion they are all hoping they are going to get you to take them to slughorn s party and they all seem to have bought fred and george love potion which i am afraid to say probably work page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling why did not you confiscate them then demanded harry it seemed extraordinary that hermiones mania for upholding rule could have abandoned her at this crucial juncture they did not have the potion with them in the bathroom said hermione scornfully they were just discussing tactic a i doubt whether even the half blood prince she gave the book another nasty look could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potion at once id just invite someone to go with you that will stop all the others thinking they have still got a chance it tomorrow night they are getting desperate there is not anyone i want to invite mumbled harry who wa still trying not to think about ginny any more than he could help despite the fact that she kept cropping up in his dream in way that made him devoutly thankful that ron could not perform legilimency well just be careful what you drink because romilda vane looked like she meant business said hermione grimly she hitched up the long roll of parchment on which she wa writing her arithmancy essay and continued to scratch away with her quill harry watched her with his mind a long way away hang on a moment he said slowly i thought filch had banned anything bought at weasleys wizard wheeze and when ha anyone ever paid attention to what filch ha banned asked hermione still concentrating on her essay page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but i thought all the owl were being searched so how come these girl are able to bring love potion into school fred and george send them disguised a perfume and cough potion said hermione it part of their owl order service you know a lot about it hermione gave him the kind of nasty look she had just given his copy of advanced potionmaking it wa all on the back of the bottle they showed ginny and me in the summer she said coldly i do not go around putting potion in people drink or pretending to either which is just a bad yeah well never mind that said harry quickly the point is filch is being fooled is not he these girl are getting stuff into the school disguised a something else so why could not malfoy have brought the necklace into the school oh harry not that again come on why not demanded harry look sighed hermione secrecy sensor detect jinx curse and concealment charm do not they they are used to find dark magic and dark object they would have picked up a powerful curse like the one on that necklace within second but something that is just been put in the wrong bottle would not register and anyway love potion are not dark or dangerous easy for you to say muttered harry thinking of romilda vane page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling so it would be down to filch to realize it wa not a cough potion and he not a very good wizard i doubt he can tell one potion from hermione stopped dead harry had heard it too somebody had moved close behind them among the dark bookshelf they waited and a moment later the vulturelike countenance of madam pince appeared around the corner her sunken cheek her skin like parchment and her long hooked nose illuminated unflatteringly by the lamp she wa carrying the library is now closed she said mind you return anything you have borrowed to the correct what have you been doing to that book you depraved boy it is not the library it mine said harry hastily snatching his copy of advanced potionmaking off the table a she lunged at it with a clawlike hand despoiled she hissed desecrated befouled it just a book that is been written on said harry tugging it out of her grip she looked a though she might have a seizure hermione who had hastily packed her thing grabbed harry by the arm and frogmarched him away she will ban you from the library if you are not careful why did you have to bring that stupid book it not my fault she is barking mad hermione or dyou think she overheard you being rude about filch i have always thought there might be something going on between them page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh ha ha enjoying the fact that they could speak normally again they made their way along the deserted lamp lit corridor back to the common room arguing about whether or not filch and madam pince were secretly in love with each other bauble said harry to the fat lady this being the new festive password same to you said the fat lady with a roguish grin and she swung forward to admit them hi harry said romilda vane the moment he had climbed through the portrait hole fancy a gillywater hermione gave him a whatdiditellyou look over her shoulder no thanks said harry quickly i do not like it much well take these anyway said romilda thrusting a box into his hand chocolate cauldron they have got firewhisky in them my gran sent them to me but i do not like them oh right thanks a lot said harry who could not think what else to say er i am just going over here with he hurried off behind hermione his voice tailing away feebly told you said hermione succinctly sooner you ask someone sooner they will all leave you alone and you can page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but her face suddenly turned blank she had just spotted ron and lavender who were entwined in the same armchair well good night harry said hermione though it wa only seven of the clock in the evening and she left for the girl dormitory without another word harry went to bed comforting himself that there wa only one more day of lesson to struggle through plus slughorns party after which he and ron would depart together for the burrow it now seemed impossible that ron and hermione would make up with each other before the holiday began but perhaps somehow the break would give them time to calm down think better of their behavior but his hope were not high and they sank still lower after enduring a transfiguration lesson with them both next day they had just embarked upon the immensely difficult topic of human transfiguration working in front of mirror they were supposed to be changing the color of their own eyebrow hermione laughed unkindly at ron disastrous first attempt during which he somehow managed to give himself a spectacular handlebar mustache ron retaliated by doing a cruel but accurate impression of hermione jumping up and down in her seat every time professor mcgonagall asked a question which lavender and parvati found deeply amusing and which reduced hermione to the verge of tear again she raced out of the classroom on the bell leaving half her thing behind harry deciding that her need wa greater than ron just now scooped up her remaining possession and followed her he finally tracked her down a she emerged from a girl bathroom on the floor below she wa page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling accompanied by luna lovegood who wa patting her vaguely on the back oh hello harry said luna did you know one of your eyebrow is bright yellow hi luna hermione you left your stuff he held out her book oh yes said hermione in a choked voice taking her thing and turning away quickly to hide the fact that she wa wiping her eye on her pencil case thank you harry well id better get going and she hurried off without giving harry any time to offer word of comfort though admittedly he could not think of any she is a bit upset said luna i thought at first it wa moaning myrtle in there but it turned out to be hermione she said something about that ron weasley yeah they have had a row said harry he say very funny thing sometimes doe not he said luna a they set off down the corridor together but he can be a bit unkind i noticed that last year i spose said harry luna wa demonstrating her usual knack of speaking uncomfortable truth he had never met anyone quite like her so have you had a good term oh it been all right said luna a bit lonely without the da ginnys been nice though she stopped two boy in our transfiguration class calling me loony the other day page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling how would you like to come to slughorns party with me tonight the word were out of harrys mouth before he could stop them he heard himself say them a though it were a stranger speaking luna turned her protuberant eye upon him in surprise slughorns party with you yeah said harry were supposed to bring guest so i thought you might like i mean he wa keen to make his intention perfectly clear i mean just a friend you know but if you do not want to he wa already half hoping that she did not want to oh no id love to go with you a friend said luna beaming a he had never seen her beam before nobody ever asked me to a party before a a friend is that why you dyed your eyebrow for the party should i do mine too no said harry firmly that wa a mistake ill get hermione to put it right for me so ill meet you in the entrance hall at eight of the clock then aha screamed a voice from overhead and both of them jumped unnoticed by either of them they had just passed right underneath peeve who wa hanging upside down from a chandelier and grinning maliciously at them potty asked loony to go to the partyl potty lurves loony potty luuuuurves looooooonyv page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and he zoomed away cackling and shrieking potty love loony nice to keep these thing private said harry and sure enough in no time at all the whole school seemed to know that harry potter wa taking luna lovegood to slughorns party you could have taken anyonel said ron in disbelief over dinner anyonel and you chose loony lovegood do not call her that ron snapped ginny pausing behind harry on her way to join friend i am really glad you are taking her harry she is so excited and she moved on down the table to sit with dean harry tried to feel pleased that ginny wa glad he wa taking luna to the party but could not quite manage it a long way along the table hermione wa sitting alone playing with her stew harry noticed ron looking at her furtively you could say sorry suggested harry bluntly what and get attacked by another flock of canary muttered ron what did you have to imitate her for she laughed at my mustache so did i it wa the stupidest thing i have ever seen but ron did not seem to have heard lavender had just arrived with parvati squeezing herself in between harry and ron lavender flung her arm around ron neck page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hi harry said parvati who like him looked faintly embarrassed and bored by the behavior of their two friend hi said harry how are you you are staying at hogwarts then i heard your parent wanted you to leave i managed to talk them out of it for the time being said parvati that katie thing really freaked them out but a there ha not been anything since oh hi hermione parvati positively beamed harry could tell that she wa feeling guilty for having laughed at hermione in transfiguration he looked around and saw that hermione wa beaming back if possible even more brightly girl were very strange sometimes hi parvati said hermione ignoring ron and lavender completely are you going to slughorns party tonight no invite said parvati gloomily id love to go though it sound like it going to be really good you are going are not you yes i am meeting cormac at eight and were there wa a noise like a plunger being withdrawn from a blocked sink and ron surfaced hermione acted a though she had not seen or heard anything were going up to the party together cormac said parvati cormac mclaggen you mean page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that is right said hermione sweetly the one who almost she put a great deal of emphasis on the word became gryffindor keeper are you going out with him then asked parvati wideeyed oh yes did not you know said hermione with a most unhermioneish giggle no said parvati looking positively agog at this piece of gossip wow you like your quidditch player do not you first krum then mclaggen i like really good quidditch player hermione corrected her still smiling well see you got to go and get ready for the party she left at once lavender and parvati put their head together to discus this new development with everything they had ever heard about mclaggen and all they had ever guessed about hermione ron looked strangely blank and said nothing harry wa left to ponder in silence the depth to which girl would sink to get revenge when he arrived in the entrance hall at eight of the clock that night he found an unusually large number of girl lurking there all of whom seemed to be staring at him resentfully a he approached luna she wa wearing a set of spangled silver robe that were attracting a certain amount of giggle from the onlooker but otherwise she looked quite nice harry wa glad in any case that she had left off her radish earring her butterbeer cork necklace and her spectrespecs hi he said shall we get going then page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh yes she said happily where is the party slughorns office said harry leading her up the marble staircase away from all the staring and muttering did you hear there is supposed to be a vampire coming rufus scrimgeour asked luna i what said harry disconcerted you mean the minister of magic yes he a vampire said luna matteroffactly father wrote a very long article about it when scrimgeour first took over from cornelius fudge but he wa forced not to publish by somebody from the ministry obviously they did not want the truth to get out harry who thought it most unlikely that rufus scrimgeour wa a vampire but who wa used to luna repeating her father bizarre view a though they were fact did not reply they were already approaching slughorns office and the sound of laughter music and loud conversation were growing louder with every step they took whether it had been built that way or because he had used magical trickery to make it so slughorns office wa much larger than the usual teacher study the ceiling and wall had been draped with emerald crimson and gold hanging so that it looked a though they were all inside a vast tent the room wa crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the center of the ceiling in which real fairy were fluttering each a brilliant speck of light loud singing accompanied by what sounded like mandolin issued from a distant corner a haze of pipe smoke hung over page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling several elderly warlock deep in conversation and a number of houseelves were negotiating their way squeakily through the forest of knee obscured by the heavy silver platter of food they were bearing so that they looked like little roving table harry mboy boomed slughorn almost a soon a harry and luna had squeezed in through the door come in come in so many people id like you to meet slughorn wa wearing a tasseled velvet hat to match his smoking jacket gripping harrys arm so tightly he might have been hoping to disapparate with him slughorn led him purposefully into the party harry seized luna hand and dragged her along with him harry id like you to meet eldred worple an old student of mine author of blood brother my life amongst the vampire and of course his friend sanguini worple who wa a small stout bespectacled man grabbed harrys hand and shook it enthusiastically the vampire sanguini who wa tall and emaciated with dark shadow under his eye merely nodded he looked rather bored a gaggle of girl wa standing close to him looking curious and excited harry potter i am simply delighted said worple peering shortsightedly up into harrys face i wa saying to professor slughorn only the other day where is the biography of harry potter for which we have all been waiting er said harry were you just a modest a horace described said worple but seriously his manner changed it became page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling suddenly businesslike i would be delighted to write it myself people are craving to know more about you dear boy craving if you were prepared to grant me a few interview say in four or fivehour session why we could have the book finished within month and all with very little effort on your part i assure you ask sanguini here if it is not quite sanguini stay here added worple suddenly stern for the vampire had been edging toward the nearby group of girl a rather hungry look in his eye here have a pasty said worple seizing one from a passing elf and stuffing it into sanguinis hand before turning his attention back to harry my dear boy the gold you could make you have no idea i am definitely not interested said harry firmly and i have just seen a friend of mine sorry he pulled luna after him into the crowd he had indeed just seen a long mane of brown hair disappear between what looked like two member of the weird sister hermione hermionev harry there you are thank goodness hi luna what is happened to you asked harry for hermione looked distinctly disheveled rather a though she had just fought her way out of a thicket of devil snare oh i have just escaped i mean i have just left cormac she said under the mistletoe she added in explanation a harry continued to look questioningly at her page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling serf you right for coming with him he told her severely i thought he would annoy ron most said hermione dispassionately i debated for a while about zacharias smith but i thought on the whole you considered smith said harry revolted yes i did and i am starting to wish id chosen him mclaggen make grawp look a gentleman let u go this way well be able to see him coming he so tall the three of them made their way over to the other side of the room scooping up goblet of mead on the way realizing too late that professor trelawney wa standing there alone hello said luna politely to professor trelawney good evening my dear said professor trelawney focusing upon luna with some difficulty harry could smell cooking sherry again i have not seen you in my class lately no i have got firenze this year said luna oh of course said professor trelawney with an angry drunken titter or dobbin a i prefer to think of him you would have thought would you not that now i am returned to the school professor dumbledore might have got rid of the horse but no we share class it an insult frankly an insult do you know professor trelawney seemed too tipsy to have recognized harry under cover of her furious criticism of firenze harry drew closer to hermione page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and said let u get something straight are you planning to tell ron that you interfered at keeper tryout hermione raised her eyebrow do you really think id stoop that low harry looked at her shrewdly hermione if you can ask out mclaggen there is a difference said hermione with dignity i have got no plan to tell ron anything about what might or might not have happened at keeper tryout good said harry fervently because hell just fall apart again and well lose the next match quidditch said hermione angrily is that all boy care about cormac ha not asked me one single question about myself no i have just been treated to a hundred great save made by cormac mclaggen nonstop ever since oh no here he come she moved so fast it wa a though she had disapparated one moment she wa there the next she had squeezed between two guffawing witch and vanished seen hermione asked mclaggen forcing his way through the throng a minute later no sorry said harry and he turned quickly to join in luna conversation forgetting for a split second to whom she wa talking harry potter said professor trelawney in deep vibrant tone noticing him for the first time page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh hello said harry unenthusiastically my dear boy she said in a very carrying whisper the rumor the story the chosen one of course i have known for a very long time the omen were never good harry but why have you not returned to divination for you of all people the subject is of the utmost importance ah sybill we all think our subject most important said a loud voice and slughorn appeared at professor trelawneys other side his face very red his velvet hat a little askew a glass of mead in one hand and an enormous mince pie in the other but i do not think i have ever known such a natural at potion said slughorn regarding harry with a fond if bloodshot eye instinctive you know like his mother i have only ever taught a few with this kind of ability i can tell you that sybill why even severus and to harrys horror slughorn threw out an arm and seemed to scoop snape out of thin air toward them stop skulking and come and join u severus hiccuped slughorn happily i wa just talking about harrys exceptional potionmaking some credit must go to you of course you taught him for five year trapped with slughorns arm around his shoulder snape looked down his hooked nose at harry his black eye narrowed funny i never had the impression that i managed to teach potter anything at all well then it natural ability shouted slughorn you should have seen what he gave me first lesson page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling draught of living death never had a student produce finer on a first attempt i do not think even you severus really said snape quietly his eye still boring into harry who felt a certain disquiet the last thing he wanted wa for snape to start investigating the source of his newfound brilliance at potion remind me what other subject you are taking harry asked slughorn defense against the dark art charm transfiguration herbology all the subject required in short for an auror said snape with the faintest sneer yeah well that is what id like to do said harry defiantly and a great one you will make too boomed slughorn i do not think you should be an auror harry said luna unexpectedly everybody looked at her the aurors are part of the rotfang conspiracy i thought everyone knew that they are working to bring down the ministry of magic from within using a combination of dark magic and gum disease harry inhaled half his mead up his nose a he started to laugh really it had been worth bringing luna just for this emerging from his goblet coughing sopping wet but still grinning he saw something calculated to raise his spirit even higher draco malfoy being dragged by the ear toward them by argus filch professor slughorn wheezed filch his jowl aquiver and the maniacal light of mischiefdetection in his page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling bulging eye i discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor he claim to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out did you issue him with an invitation malfoy pulled himself free of filch s grip looking furious all right i wa not invited he said angrily i wa trying to gatecrash happy no i am not said filch a statement at complete odds with the glee on his face you are in trouble you are did not the headmaster say that nighttime prowlings out unless you have got permission did not he eh that is all right argus that is all right said slughorn waving a hand it christmas and it not a crime to want to come to a party just this once well forget any punishment you may stay draco filch s expression of outraged disappointment wa perfectly predictable but why harry wondered watching him did malfoy look almost equally unhappy and why wa snape looking at malfoy a though both angry and wa it possible a little afraid but almost before harry had registered what he had seen filch had turned and shuffled away muttering under his breath malfoy had composed his face into a smile and wa thanking slughorn for his generosity and snapes face wa smoothly inscrutable again it nothing nothing said slughorn waving away malfoy s thanks i did know your grandfather after all page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he always spoke very highly of you sir said malfoy quickly said you were the best potionmaker he would ever known harry stared at malfoy it wa not the suckingup that intrigued him he had watched malfoy do that to snape for a long time it wa the fact that malfoy did after all look a little ill this wa the first time he had seen malfoy close up for age he now saw that malfoy had dark shadow under his eye and a distinctly grayish tinge to his skin id like a word with you draco said snape suddenly oh now severus said slughorn hiccuping again it christmas do not be too hard i am his head of house and i shall decide how hard or otherwise to be said snape curtly follow me draco they left snape leading the way malfoy looking resentful harry stood there for a moment irresolute then said ill be back in a bit luna er bathroom all right she said cheerfully and he thought he heard her a he hurried off into the crowd resume the subject of the rotfang conspiracy with professor trelawney who seemed sincerely interested it wa easy once out of the party to pull his invisibility cloak out of his pocket and throw it over himself for the corridor wa quite deserted what wa more difficult wa finding snape and malfoy harry ran down the corridor the noise of his foot masked by the music and loud talk still issuing from slughorn s office behind him perhaps snape had taken malfoy to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling his office in the dungeon or perhaps he wa escorting him back to the slytherin common room harry pressed his ear against door after door a he dashed down the corridor until with a great jolt of excitement he crouched down to the keyhole of the last classroom in the corridor and heard voice can not afford mistake draco because if you are expelled i did not have anything to do with it all right i hope you are telling the truth because it wa both clumsy and foolish already you are suspected of having a hand in it who suspect me said malfoy angrily for the last time i did not do it okay that bell girl must have had an enemy no one know about do not look at me like that i know what you are doing i am not stupid but it will not work i can stop you there wa a pause and then snape said quietly ah aunt bellatrix ha been teaching you occlumency i see what thought are you trying to conceal from your master draco i am not trying to conceal anything from him i just do not want you butting in harry pressed his ear still more closely against the keyhole what had happened to make malfoy speak to snape like this snape toward whom he had always shown respect even liking so that is why you have been avoiding me this term you have feared my interference you realize that had anybody else failed to come to my office when i had told them repeatedly to be there draco page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling so put me in detention report me to dumbledore jeered malfoy there wa another pause then snape said you know perfectly well that i do not wish to do either of those thing you would better stop telling me to come to your office then listen to me said snape his voice so low now that harry had to push his ear very hard against the keyhole to hear i am trying to help you i swore to your mother i would protect you i made the unbreakable vow draco look like you have to break it then because i do not need your protection it my job he gave it to me and i am doing it i have got a plan and it going to work it just taking a bit longer than i thought it would what is your plan it none of your business if you tell me what you are trying to do i can assist you i have got all the assistance i need thanks i am not alone you were certainly alone tonight which wa foolish in the extreme wandering the corridor without lookout or backup these are elementary mistake i would have had crabbe and goyle with me if you had not put them in detention page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling keep your voice down spat snape for malfoys voice had risen excitedly if your friend crabbe and goyle intend to pas their defense against the dark art owl this time around they will need to work a little harder than they are doing at pres what doe it matter said malfoy defense against the dark art it all just a joke is not it an act like any of u need protecting against the dark art it is an act that is crucial to success draco said snape where do you think i would have been all these year if i had not known how to act now listen to me you are being incautious wandering around at night getting yourself caught and if you are placing your reliance in assistant like crabbe and goyle they are not the only one i have got other people on my side better people then why not confide in me and i can i know what you are up to you want to steal my glory there wa another pause then snape said coldly you are speaking like a child i quite understand that your father capture and imprisonment ha upset you but harry had barely a second warning he heard malfoys footstep on the other side of the door and flung himself out of the way just a it burst open malfoy wa striding away down the corridor past the open door of slughorns office around the distant corner and out of sight page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hardly daring to breathe harry remained crouched down a snape emerged slowly from the classroom his expression unfathomable he returned to the party harry remained on the floor hidden beneath the cloak his mind racing page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling a very frosty christmas so snape wa offering to help him he wa definitely offering to help him if you ask that once more said harry i am going to stick this sprout i am only checking said ron they were standing alone at the burrow kitchen sink peeling a mountain of sprout for mr weasley snow wa drifting past the window in front of them yes snape wa offering to help himl said harry he said he would promised malfoys mother to protect him that he would made an unbreakable oath or something an unbreakable vow said ron looking stunned nah he can not have are you sure yes i am sure said harry why what doe it mean page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well you can not break an unbreakable vow id worked that much out for myself funnily enough what happens if you break it then you die said ron simply fred and george tried to get me to make one when i wa about five i nearly did too i wa holding hand with fred and everything when dad found u he went mental said ron with a reminiscent gleam in his eye only time i have ever seen dad a angry a mum fred reckons his left buttock ha never been the same since yeah well passing over freds left buttock i beg your pardon said freds voice a the twin entered the kitchen aaah george look at this they are using knife and everything bless them ill be seventeen in two and a bit month time said ron grumpily and then ill be able to do it by magic but meanwhile said george sitting down at the kitchen table and putting his foot up on it we can enjoy watching you demonstrate the correct use of a whoopsadaisy you made me do that said ron angrily sucking his cut thumb you wait when i am seventeen i am sure you will dazzle u all with hitherto unsuspected magical skill yawned fred and speaking of hitherto unsuspected skill ronald said george what is this we hear from ginny about you and a young lady called unless our information is faulty lavender brown page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron turned a little pink but did not look displeased a he turned back to the sprout mind your own business what a snappy retort said fred i really do not know how you think of them no what we wanted to know wa how did it happen what dyou mean did she have an accident or something what well how did she sustain such extensive brain damage careful now mr weasley entered the room just in time to see ron throw the sprout knife at fred who had turned it into a paper airplane with one lazy flick of his wand ronl she said furiously do not you ever let me see you throwing knife again i will not said ron let you see he added under his breath a he turned back to the sprout mountain fred george i am sorry dear but remus is arriving tonight so bill will have to squeeze in with you two no problem said george then a charlie is not coming home that just leaf harry and ron in the attic and if fleur share with ginny that will make ginnys christmas muttered fred page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling everyone should be comfortable well they will have a bed anyway said mr weasley sounding slightly harassed percy definitely not showing his ugly face then asked fred mr weasley turned away before she answered no he busy i expect at the ministry or he the world biggest prat said fred a mr weasley left the kitchen one of the two well let u get going then george what are you two up to asked ron can not you help u with these sprout you could just use your wand and then well be free too no i do not think we can do that said fred seriously it very characterbuilding stuff learning to peel sprout without magic make you appreciate how difficult it is for muggles and squib and if you want people to help you ron added george throwing the paper airplane at him i would not chuck knife at them just a little hint were off to the village there is a very pretty girl working in the paper shop who think my card trick are something marvelous almost like real magic git said ron darkly watching fred and george setting off across the snowy yard would have only taken them ten second and then we could have gone too i could not said harry i promised dumbledore i would not wander off while i am staying here page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh yeah said ron he peeled a few more sprout and then said are you going to tell dumbledore what you heard snape and malfoy saying to each other yep said harry i am going to tell anyone who can put a stop to it and dumbledores top of the list i might have another word with your dad too pity you did not hear what malfoys actually doing though i could not have done could i that wa the whole point he wa refusing to tell snape there wa silence for a moment or two then ron said course you know what they will all say dad and dumbledore and all of them they will say snape is not really trying to help malfoy he wa just trying to find out what malfoys up to they did not hear him said harry flatly no one that good an actor not even snape yeah i am just saying though said ron harry turned to face him frowning you think i am right though yeah i do said ron hastily seriously i do but they are all convinced snapes in the order are not they harry said nothing it had already occurred to him that this would be the most likely objection to his new evidence he could hear hermione now obviously harry he wa pretending to offer help so he could trick malfoy into telling him what he doing page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling this wa pure imagination however a he had had no opportunity to tell hermione what he had overheard she had disappeared from slughorns parry before he returned to it or so he had been informed by an irate mclaggen and she had already gone to bed by the time he returned to the common room a he and ron had left for the burrow early the next day he had barely had time to wish her a happy christmas and to tell her that he had some very important news when they got back from the holiday he wa not entirely sure that she had heard him though ron and lavender had been saying a thoroughly nonverbal goodbye just behind him at the time still even hermione would not be able to deny one thing malfoy wa definitely up to something and snape knew it so harry felt fully justified in saying i told you so which he had done several time to ron already harry did not get the chance to speak to mr weasley who wa working very long hour at the ministry until christmas eve night the weasleys and their guest were sitting in the living room which ginny had decorated so lavishly that it wa rather like sitting in a paperchain explosion fred george harry and ron were the only one who knew that the angel on top of the tree wa actually a garden gnome that had bitten fred on the ankle a he pulled up carrot for christmas dinner stupefied painted gold stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wing glued to it back it glowered down at them all the ugliest angel harry had ever seen with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy foot they were all supposed to be listening to a christmas broadcast by mr weasleys favorite singer celestina warbeck whose voice wa warbling out of the large page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling wooden wireless set fleur who seemed to find celestina very dull wa talking so loudly in the corner that a scowling mr weasley kept pointing her wand at the volume control so that celestina grew louder and louder under cover of a particularly jazzy number called a cauldron full of hot strong love fred and george started a game of exploding snap with ginny ron kept shooting bill and fleur covert look a though hoping to pick up tip meanwhile remus lupin who wa thinner and more ragged looking than ever wa sitting beside the fire staring into it depth a though he could not hear celestinas voice oh come and stir my cauldron and if you do it right ill boil you up some hot strong love to keep you warm tonight we danced to this when we were eighteen said mr weasley wiping her eye on her knitting do you remember arthur mphf said mr weasley whose head had been nodding over the satsuma he wa peeling oh yes marvelous tune with an effort he sat up a little straighter and looked around at harry who wa sitting next to him sorry about this he said jerking his head toward the wireless a celestina broke into the chorus be over soon no problem said harry grinning ha it been busy at the ministry very said mr weasley i would not mind if we were getting anywhere but of the three arrest we have made page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling in the last couple of month i doubt that one of them is a genuine death eater only do not repeat that harry he added quickly looking much more awake all of a sudden they are not still holding stan shunpike are they asked harry i am afraid so said mr weasley i know dumbledores tried appealing directly to scrimgeour about stan i mean anybody who ha actually interviewed him agrees that he about a much a death eater a this satsuma but the top level want to look a though they are making some progress and three arrest sound better than three mistaken arrest and release but again this is all top secret i will not say anything said harry he hesitated for a moment wondering how best to embark on what he wanted to say a he marshaled his thought celestina warbeck began a ballad called you charmed the heart right out of me mr weasley you know what i told you at the station when we were setting off for school i checked harry said mr weasley at once i went and searched the malfoys house there wa nothing either broken or whole that should not have been there yeah i know i saw in the prophet that you would looked but this is something different well something more and he told mr weasley everything he had overheard between malfoy and snape a harry spoke he saw lupin head turn a little toward him taking in every page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling word when he had finished there wa silence except for celestinas crooning oh my poor heart where ha it gone it left me for a spell ha it occurred to you harry said mr weasley that snape wa simply pretending pretending to offer help so that he could find out what malfoys up to said harry quickly yeah i thought you would say that but how do we know it is not our business to know said lupin unexpectedly he had turned his back on the fire now and faced harry across mr weasley it dumbledores business dumbledore trust severus and that ought to be good enough for all of u but said harry just say just say dumbledores wrong about snape people have said it many time it come down to whether or not you trust dumbledores judgment i do therefore i trust severus but dumbledore can make mistake argued harry he say it himself and you he looked lupin straight in the eye do you honestly like snape i neither like nor dislike severus said lupin no harry i am speaking the truth he added a harry pulled a skeptical expression we shall never be bosom friend perhaps after all that happened between james and sirius and severus there is too much bitterness there but i do not forget that during the year i taught at hogwarts severus made the wolfsbane potion for me every month made it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling perfectly so that i did not have to suffer a i usually do at the full moon but he accidentally let it slip that you are a werewolf so you had to leave said harry angrily lupin shrugged the news would have leaked out anyway we both know he wanted my job but he could have wreaked much worse damage on me by tampering with the potion he kept me healthy i must be grateful maybe he did not dare mess with the potion with dumbledore watching him said harry you are determined to hate him harry said lupin with a faint smile and i understand with james a your father with sirius a your godfather you have inherited an old prejudice by all mean tell dumbledore what you have told arthur and me but do not expect him to share your view of the matter do not even expect him to be surprised by what you tell him it might have been on dumbledores order that severus questioned draco and now you have torn it quite apart ill thank you to give back my heart celestina ended her song on a very long highpitched note and loud applause issued out of the wireless which mr weasley joined in with enthusiastically eez eet over said fleur loudly thank goodness what an orrible shall we have a nightcap then asked mr weasley loudly leaping to his foot who want eggnog page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what have you been up to lately harry asked lupin a mr weasley bustled off to fetch the eggnog and everybody else stretched and broke into conversation oh i have been underground said lupin almost literally that is why i have not been able to write harry sending letter to you would have been something of a giveaway what do you mean i have been living among my fellow my equal said lupin werewolf he added at harrys look of incomprehension nearly all of them are on voldemorts side dumbledore wanted a spy and here i wa readymade he sounded a little bitter and perhaps realized it for he smiled more warmly a he went on i am not complaining it is necessary work and who can do it better than i however it ha been difficult gaining their trust i bear the unmistakable sign of having tried to live among wizard you see whereas they have shunned normal society and live on the margin stealing and sometimes killing to eat how come they like voldemort they think that under his rule they will have a better life said lupin and it is hard to argue with grey back out there who is grey back you have not heard of him lupin hand closed convulsively in his lap fenrir greyback is perhaps the most savage werewolf alive today he regard it a his mission in life to bite and to contaminate a many page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling people a possible he want to create enough werewolf to overcome the wizard voldemort ha promised him prey in return for his service greyback specializes in child bite them young he say and raise them away from their parent raise them to hate normal wizard voldemort ha threatened to unleash him upon people son and daughter it is a threat that usually produce good result lupin paused and then said it wa greyback who bit me what said harry astonished when when you were a kid you mean yes my father had offended him i did not know for a very long time the identity of the werewolf who had attacked me i even felt pity for him thinking that he had had no control knowing by then how it felt to transform but greyback is not like that at the full moon he position himself close to victim ensuring that he is near enough to strike he plan it all and this is the man voldemort is using to marshal the werewolf i can not pretend that my particular brand of reasoned argument is making much headway against greyback insistence that we werewolf deserve blood that we ought to revenge ourselves on normal people but you are normal said harry fiercely you have just got a a problem lupin burst out laughing sometimes you remind me a lot of james he called it my furry little problem in company many people were under the impression that i owned a badly behaved rabbit page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he accepted a glass of eggnog from mr weasley with a word of thanks looking slightly more cheerful harry meanwhile felt a rush of excitement this last mention of his father had reminded him that there wa something he had been looking forward to asking lupin have you ever heard of someone called the half blood prince the halfblood what prince said harry watching him closely for sign of recognition there are no wizarding prince said lupin now smiling is this a title you are thinking of adopting i should have thought being the chosen one would be enough it nothing to do with me said harry indignantly the halfblood prince is someone who used to go to hogwarts i have got his old potion book he wrote spell all over it spell he invented one of them wa levicorpus oh that one had a great vogue during my time at hogwarts said lupin reminiscently there were a few month in my fifth year when you could not move for being hoisted into the air by your ankle my dad used it said harry i saw him in the pensieve he used it on snape he tried to sound casual a though this wa a throwaway comment of no real importance but he wa not sure he had achieved the right effect lupin smile wa a little too understanding page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yes he said but he wa not the only one a i say it wa very popular you know how these spell come and go but it sound like it wa invented while you were at school harry persisted not necessarily said lupin jinx go in and out of fashion like everything else he looked into harrys face and then said quietly james wa a pureblood harry and i promise you he never asked u to call him prince abandoning pretense harry said and it wa not sirius or you definitely not oh harry stared into the fire i just thought well he helped me out a lot in potion class the prince ha how old is this book harry i do not know i have never checked well perhaps that will give you some clue a to when the prince wa at hogwarts said lupin shortly after this fleur decided to imitate celestina singing a cauldron full of hot strong love which wa taken by everyone once they had glimpsed mr weasleys expression to be the cue to go to bed harry and ron climbed all the way up to ron attic bedroom where a camp bed had been added for harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron fell asleep almost immediately but harry delved into his trunk and pulled out his copy of advanced potionmaking before getting into bed there he turned it page searching until he finally found at the front of the book the date that it had been published it wa nearly fifty year old neither his father nor his father friend had been at hogwarts fifty year ago feeling disappointed harry threw the book back into his trunk turned off the lamp and rolled over thinking of werewolf and snape stan shunpike and the halfblood prince and finally falling into an uneasy sleep full of creeping shadow and the cry of bitten child she is got to be joking harry woke with a start to find a bulging stocking lying over the end of his bed he put on his glass and looked around the tiny window wa almost completely obscured with snow and in front of it ron wa sitting bolt upright in bed and examining what appeared to be a thick gold chain what is that asked harry it from lavender said ron sounding revolted she can not honestly think id wear harry looked more closely and let out a shout of laughter dangling from the chain in large gold letter were the word my sweetheart nice he said classy you should definitely wear it in front of fred and george page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling if you tell them said ron shoving the necklace out of sight under his pillow i i stutter at me said harry grinning come on would i how could she think id like something like that though ron demanded of thin air looking rather shocked well think back said harry have you ever let it slip that you would like to go out in public with the word my sweetheart round your neck well we do not really talk much said ron it mainly snogging said harry well yeah said ron he hesitated a moment then said is hermione really going out with mclaggen i do not know said harry they were at slughorns party together but i do not think it went that well ron looked slightly more cheerful a he delved deeper into his stocking harrys present included a sweater with a large golden snitch worked onto the front handknitted by mr weasley a large box of weasleys wizard wheeze product from the twin and a slightly damp moldysmelling package that came with a label reading to master from kreacher harry stared at it dyou reckon this is safe to open he asked page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling can not be anything dangerous all our mail still being searched at the ministry replied ron though he wa eyeing the parcel suspiciously i did not think of giving kreacher anything do people usually give their houseelves christmas present asked harry prodding the parcel cautiously hermione would said ron but let u wait and see what it is before you start feeling guilty a moment later harry had given a loud yell and leapt out of his camp bed the package contained a large number of maggot nice said ron roaring with laughter very thoughtful id rather have them than that necklace said harry which sobered ron up at once everybody wa wearing new sweater when they all sat down for christmas lunch everyone except fleur on whom it appeared mr weasley had not wanted to waste one and mr weasley herself who wa sporting a brandnew midnight blue witch hat glittering with what looked like tiny starlike diamond and a spectacular golden necklace fred and george gave them to me are not they beautiful well we find we appreciate you more and more mum now were washing our own sock said george waving an airy hand parsnip remus harry you have got a maggot in your hair said ginny cheerfully leaning across the table to pick it out page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry felt goose bump erupt up his neck that had nothing to do with the maggot ow orrible said fleur with an affected little shudder yes is not it said ron gravy fleur in his eagerness to help her he knocked the gravy boat flying bill waved his wand and the gravy soared up in the air and returned meekly to the boat you are a bad a zat tonks said fleur to ron when she had finished kissing bill in thanks she is always knocking i invited dear tonks to come along today said mr weasley setting down the carrot with unnecessary force and glaring at fleur but she would not come have you spoken to her lately remus no i have not been in contact with anybody very much said lupin but tonks ha got her own family to go to ha not she hmmm said mr weasley maybe i got the impression she wa planning to spend christmas alone actually she gave lupin an annoyed look a though it wa all his fault she wa getting fleur for a daughterinlaw instead of tonks but harry glancing across at fleur who wa now feeding bill bit of turkey off her own fork thought that mr weasley wa fighting a long lost battle he wa however reminded of a question he had with regard to tonks and who better to ask than lupin the man who knew all about patronuses page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tonkss patronus ha changed it form he told him snape said so anyway i did not know that could happen why would your patronus change lupin took his time chewing his turkey and swallowing before saying slowly sometimes a great shock an emotional upheaval it looked big and it had four leg said harry struck by a sudden thought and lowering his voice hey it could not be arthur said mr weasley suddenly she had risen from her chair her hand wa pressed over her heart and she wa staring out of the kitchen window arthur it percy what mr weasley looked around everybody looked quickly at the window ginny stood up for a better look there sure enough wa percy weasley striding across the snowy yard his hornrimmed glass glinting in the sunlight he wa not however alone arthur he he with the minister and sure enough the man harry had seen in the daily prophet wa following along in percy wake limping slightly his mane of graying hair and his black cloak flecked with snow before any of them could say anything before mr and mr weasley could do more than exchange stunned look the back door opened and there stood percy there wa a moment painful silence then percy said rather stiffly merry christmas mother page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh percy said mr weasley and she threw herself into his arm rufus scrimgeour paused in the doorway leaning on his walking stick and smiling a he observed this affecting scene you must forgive this intrusion he said when mr weasley looked around at him beaming and wiping her eye percy and i were in the vicinity working you know and he could not resist dropping in and seeing you all but percy showed no sign of wanting to greet any of the rest of the family he stood pokerstraight and awkwardlooking and stared over everybody el head mr weasley fred and george were all observing him stonyfaced please come in sit down minister fluttered mr weasley straightening her hat have a little purkey or some tooding i mean no no my dear molly said scrimgeour harry guessed that he had checked her name with percy before they entered the house i do not want to intrude would not be here at all if percy had not wanted to see you all so badly oh perce said mr weasley tearfully reaching up to kiss him we have only looked in for five minute so ill have a stroll around the yard while you catch up with percy no no i assure you i do not want to butt in well if anybody cared to show me your charming garden ah that young man finished why doe not he take a stroll with me page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the atmosphere around the table changed perceptibly everybody looked from scrimgeour to harry nobody seemed to find scrimgeour s pretense that he did not know harrys name convincing or find it natural that he should be chosen to accompany the minister around the garden when ginny fleur and george also had clean plate yeah all right said harry into the silence he wa not fooled for all scrimgeours talk that they had just been in the area that percy wanted to look up his family this must be the real reason that they had come so that scrimgeour could speak to harry alone it fine he said quietly a he passed lupin who had half risen from his chair fine he added a mr weasley opened his mouth to speak wonderful said scrimgeour standing back to let harry pas through the door ahead of him well just take a turn around the garden and percy and ill be off carry on everyone harry walked across the yard toward the weasleys overgrown snowcovered garden scrimgeour limping slightly at his side he had harry knew been head of the auror office he looked tough and battlescarred very different from portly fudge in his bowler hat charming said scrimgeour stopping at the garden fence and looking out over the snowy lawn and the indistinguishable plant charming harry said nothing he could tell that scrimgeour wa watching him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i have wanted to meet you for a very long time said scrimgeour after a few moment did you know that no said harry truthfully oh yes for a very long time but dumbledore ha been very protective of you said scrimgeour natural of course natural after what you have been through especially what happened at the ministry he waited for harry to say something but harry did not oblige so he went on i have been hoping for an occasion to talk to you ever since i gained office but dumbledore ha most understandably a i say prevented this still harry said nothing waiting the rumor that have flown around said scrimgeour well of course we both know how these story get distorted all these whisper of a prophecy of you being the chosen one they were getting near it now harry thought the reason scrimgeour wa here i assume that dumbledore ha discussed these matter with you harry deliberated wondering whether he ought to lie or not he looked at the little gnome print all around the flowerbed and the scuffedup patch that marked the spot where fred had caught the gnome now wearing the tutu at the top of the christmas tree finally he decided on the truth or a bit of it yeah we have discussed it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling have you have you said scrimgeour harry could see out of the corner of his eye scrimgeour squinting at him so he pretended to be very interested in a gnome that had just poked it head out from underneath a frozen rhododendron and what ha dumbledore told you harry sorry but that is between u said harry he kept his voice a pleasant a he could and scrimgeours tone too wa light and friendly a he said oh of course if it a question of confidence i would not want you to divulge no no and in any case doe it really matter whether you are the chosen one or not harry had to mull that one over for a few second before responding i do not really know what you mean minister well of course to you it will matter enormously said scrimgeour with a laugh but to the wizarding community at large it all perception is not it it what people believe that is important harry said nothing he thought he saw dimly where they were heading but he wa not going to help scrimgeour get there the gnome under the rhododendron wa now digging for worm at it root and harry kept his eye fixed upon it people believe you are the chosen one you see said scrimgeour they think you quite the hero which of course you are harry chosen or not how many time have you faced hewhomustnotbe named now well anyway he pressed on without waiting for a reply the point is you are a symbol of hope for many harry the idea that there is somebody out there who might be able who might even be destined to destroy hewhomustnotbe page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling named well naturally it give people a lift and i can not help but feel that once you realize this you might consider it well almost a duty to stand alongside the ministry and give everyone a boost the gnome had just managed to get hold of a worm it wa now tugging very hard on it trying to get it out of the frozen ground harry wa silent so long that scrimgeour said looking from harry to the gnome funny little chap are not they but what say you harry i do not exactly understand what you want said harry slowly stand alongside the ministry what doe that mean oh well nothing at all onerous i assure you said scrimgeour if you were to be seen popping in and out of the ministry from time to time for instance that would give the right impression and of course while you were there you would have ample opportunity to speak to gawain robards my successor a head of the auror office dolores umbridge ha told me that you cherish an ambition to become an auror well that could be arranged very easily harry felt anger bubbling in the pit of his stomach so dolores umbridge wa still at the ministry wa she so basically he said a though he just wanted to clarify a few point you would like to give the impression that i am working for the ministry it would give everyone a lift to think you were more involved harry said scrimgeour sounding relieved that harry had cottoned on so quickly the chosen one you know it all about giving people hope the feeling that exciting thing are happening page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but if i keep running in and out of the ministry said harry still endeavoring to keep his voice friendly will not that seem a though i approve of what the ministry up to well said scrimgeour frowning slightly well yes that is partly why wed like no i do not think that will work said harry pleasantly you see i do not like some of the thing the ministry doing locking up stan shunpike for instance scrimgeour did not speak for a moment but his expression hardened instantly i would not expect you to understand he said and he wa not a successful at keeping anger out of his voice a harry had been these are dangerous time and certain measure need to be taken you are sixteen year old dumbledores a lot older than sixteen and he doe not think stan should be in azkaban either said harry you are making stan a scapegoat just like you want to make me a mascot they looked at each other long and hard finally scrimgeour said with no pretense at warmth i see you prefer like your hero dumbledore to disassociate yourself from the ministry i do not want to be used said harry some would say it your duty to be used by the ministry yeah and others might say it your duty to check that people really are death eater before you chuck them in prison said harry his temper rising now you are doing what barty crouch did you never get it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling right you people do you either we have got fudge pretending everythings lovely while people get murdered right under his nose or we have got you chucking the wrong people into jail and trying to pretend you have got the chosen one working for you so you are not the chosen one said scrimgeour i thought you said it did not matter either way said harry with a bitter laugh not to you anyway i should not have said that said scrimgeour quickly it wa tactless no it wa honest said harry one of the only honest thing you have said to me you do not care whether i live or die but you do care that i help you convince everyone you are winning the war against voldemort i have not forgotten minister he raised his right fist there shining white on the back of his cold hand were the scar which dolores umbridge had forced him to carve into his own flesh must not tell lie i do not remember you rushing to my defense when i wa trying to tell everyone voldemort wa back the ministry wa not so keen to be pal last year they stood in silence a icy a the ground beneath their foot the gnome had finally managed to extricate his worm and wa now sucking on it happily leaning against the bottommost branch of the rhododendron bush what is dumbledore up to said scrimgeour brusquely where doe he go when he is absent from hogwarts page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no idea said harry and you would not tell me if you knew said scrimgeour would you no i would not said harry well then i shall have to see whether i can not find out by other mean you can try said harry indifferently but you seem cleverer than fudge so id have thought you would have learned from his mistake he tried interfering at hogwarts you might have noticed he not minister anymore but dumbledores still headmaster id leave dumbledore alone if i were you there wa a long pause well it is clear to me that he ha done a very good job on you said scrimgeour his eye cold and hard behind his wirerimmed glass dumbledores man through and through are not you potter yeah i am said harry glad we straightened that out and turning his back on the minister of magic he strode back toward the house page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling a sluggish memory late in the afternoon a few day after new year harry ron and ginny lined up beside the kitchen fire to return to hogwarts the ministry had arranged this oneoff connection to the floo network to return student quickly and safely to the school only mr weasley wa there to say goodbye a mr weasley fred george bill and fleur were all at work mr weasley dissolved into tear at the moment of parting admittedly it took very little to set her off lately she had been cry on and off ever since percy had stormed from the house on christmas day with his glass splattered with mashed parsnip for which fred george and ginny all claimed credit do not cry mum said ginny patting her on the back a mr weasley sobbed into her shoulder it okay yeah do not worry about u said ron permitting his mother to plant a very wet kiss on his cheek or page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling about percy he such a prat it not really a loss is it mr weasley sobbed harder than ever a she enfolded harry in her arm promise me you will look after yourself stay out of trouble i always do mr weasley said harry i like a quiet life you know me she gave a watery chuckle and stood back be good then all of you harry stepped into the emerald fire and shouted hogwarts he had one last fleeting view of the weasleys kitchen and mr weasleys tearful face before the flame engulfed him spinning very fast he caught blurred glimpse of other wizarding room which were whipped out of sight before he could get a proper look then he wa slowing down finally stopping squarely in the fireplace in professor mcgonagalls office she barely glanced up from her work a he clambered out over the grate evening potter try not to get too much ash on the carpet no professor harry straightened his glass and flattened his hair a ron came spinning into view when ginny had arrived all three of them trooped out of mcgonagalls office and off toward gryffindor tower harry glanced out of the corridor window a they passed the sun wa already sinking over ground carpeted in deeper snow than had lain over the burrow garden in the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling distance he could see hagrid feeding buckbeak in front of his cabin bauble said ron confidently when they reached the fat lady who wa looking rather paler than usual and winced at his loud voice no she said what dyou mean no there is a new password she said and please do not shout but we have been away how are we supposed to harry ginny hermione wa hurrying toward them very pinkfaced and wearing a cloak hat and glove i got back a couple of hour ago i have just been down to visit hagrid and buck i mean witherwings she said breathlessly did you have a good christmas yeah said ron at once pretty eventful rufus scrim i have got something for you harry said hermione neither looking at ron nor giving any sign that she had heard him oh hang on password abstinence precisely said the fat lady in a feeble voice and swung forward to reveal the portrait hole what is up with her asked harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling overindulged over christmas apparently said hermione rolling her eye a she led the way into the packed common room she and her friend violet drank their way through all the wine in that picture of drunk monk down by the charm corridor anyway she rummaged in her pocket for a moment then pulled out a scroll of parchment with dumbledores writing on it great said harry unrolling it at once to discover that his next lesson with dumbledore wa scheduled for the following night i have got load to tell him and you let u sit down but at that moment there wa a loud squeal of won won and lavender brown came hurtling out of nowhere and flung herself into ron arm several onlooker sniggered hermione gave a tinkling laugh and said there is a table over here coming ginny no thanks i said id meet dean said ginny though harry could not help noticing that she did not sound very enthusiastic leaving ron and lavender locked in a kind of vertical wrestling match harry led hermione over to the spare table so how wa your christmas oh fine she shrugged nothing special how wa it at wonwons ill tell you in a minute said harry look hermione can not you no i can not she said flatly so do not even ask page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i thought maybe you know over christmas it wa the fat lady who drank a vat of fivehundred year old wine harry not me so what wa this important news you wanted to tell me she looked too fierce to argue with at that moment so harry dropped the subject of ron and recounted all that he had overheard between malfoy and snape when he had finished hermione sat in thought for a moment and then said do not you think he wa pretending to offer help so that he could trick malfoy into telling him what he doing well yes said hermione ron dad and lupin think so harry said grudgingly but this definitely prof malfoys planning something you can not deny that no i can not she answered slowly and he acting on voldemorts order just like i said hmm did either of them actually mention voldemorts name harry frowned trying to remember i am not sure snape definitely said your master and who else would that be i do not know said hermione biting her lip maybe his father she stared across the room apparently lost in thought not even noticing lavender tickling ron how is lupin page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling not great said harry and he told her all about lupin mission among the werewolf and the difficulty he wa facing have you heard of this fenrir grey back yes i have said hermione sounding startled and so have you harry when history of magic you know full well i never listened no no not history of magic malfoy threatened borgin with him said hermione back in knockturn alley do not you remember he told borgin that grey back wa an old family friend and that he would be checking up on borgins progress harry gaped at her i forgot but this prof malfoys a death eater how else could he be in contact with greyback and telling him what to do it is pretty suspicious breathed hermione unless oh come on said harry in exasperation you can not get round this one well there is the possibility it wa an empty threat you are unbelievable you are said harry shaking his head well see who is right you will be eating your word hermione just like the ministry oh yeah i had a row with rufus scrimgeour a well and the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the minister of magic for hermione like ron thought that after all the ministry had put page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry through the previous year they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now the new term started next morning with a pleasant surprise for the sixth year a large sign had been pinned to the common room notice board overnight apparition lesson if you are seventeen year of age or will turn seventeen on or before the st august next you are eligible for a twelveweek course of apparition lesson from a ministry of magic apparition instructor please sign below if you would like to participate cost galleon harry and ron joined the crowd that wa jostling around the notice and taking it in turn to write their name at the bottom ron wa just taking out his quill to sign after hermione when lavender crept up behind him slipped her hand over his eye and trilled guess who wonwon harry turned to see hermione stalking off he caught up with her having no wish to stay behind with ron and lavender but to his surprise ron caught up with them only a little way beyond the portrait hole his ear bright red and his expression disgruntled without a word hermione sped up to walk with neville so apparition said ron his tone making it perfectly plain that harry wa not to mention what had just happened should be a laugh eh i do not know said harry maybe it better when you do it yourself i did not enjoy it much when dumbledore took me along for the ride page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i forgot you would already done it id better pas my test first time said ron looking anxious fred and george did charlie failed though did not he yeah but charlies bigger than me ron held his arm out from his body a though he wa a gorilla so fred and george did not go on about it much not to his face anyway when can we take the actual test soon a were seventeen that is only march for me yeah but you would not be able to apparate in here not in the castle not the point is it everyone would know i could apparate if i wanted ron wa not the only one to be excited at the prospect of apparition all that day there wa much talk about the forthcoming lesson a great deal of store wa set by being able to vanish and reappear at will how cool will it be when we can just seamus clicked his finger to indicate disappearance me cousin fergus doe it just to annoy me you wait till i can do it back hell never have another peaceful moment lost in vision of this happy prospect he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that wa the object of today charm lesson he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked professor flitwick flat on his face page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harrys already apparated ron told a slightly abashed seamus after professor flitwick had dried himself off with a wave of his wand and set seamus line i am a wizard not a baboon brandishing a stick dum er someone took him sidealong apparition you know whoa whispered seamus and he dean and neville put their head a little closer to hear what apparition felt like for the rest of the day harry wa besieged with request from the other sixth year to describe the sensation of apparition all of them seemed awed rather than put off when he told them how uncomfortable it wa and he wa still answering detailed question at ten to eight that evening when he wa forced to lie and say that he needed to return a book to the library so a to escape in time for his lesson with dumbledore the lamp in dumbledore s office were lit the portrait of previous headmaster were snoring gently in their frame and the pensieve wa ready upon the desk once more dumbledore s hand lay on either side of it the right one a blackened and burnt looking a ever it did not seem to have healed at all and harry wondered for perhaps the hundredth time what had caused such a distinctive injury but did not ask dumbledore had said that he would know eventually and there wa in any case another subject he wanted to discus but before harry could say anything about snape and malfoy dumbledore spoke i hear that you met the minister of magic over christmas yes said harry he not very happy with me page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no sighed dumbledore he is not very happy with me either we must try not to sink beneath our anguish harry but battle on harry grinned he wanted me to tell the wizarding community that the ministry doing a wonderful job dumbledore smiled it wa fudge idea originally you know during his last day in office when he wa trying desperately to cling to his post he sought a meeting with you hoping that you would give him your support after everything fudge did last year said harry angrily after umbridge i told cornelius there wa no chance of it but the idea did not die when he left office within hour of scrimgeours appointment we met and he demanded that i arrange a meeting with you so that is why you argued harry blurted out it wa in the daily prophet the prophet is bound to report the truth occasionally said dumbledore if only accidentally yes that wa why we argued well it appears that rufus found a way to corner you at last he accused me of being dumbledore s man through and through how very rude of him i told him i wa page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore opened his mouth to speak and then closed it again behind harry fawkes the phoenix let out a low soft musical cry to harrys intense embarrassment he suddenly realized that dumbledore s bright blue eye looked rather watery and stared hastily at his own knee when dumbledore spoke however his voice wa quite steady i am very touched harry scrimgeour wanted to know where you go when you are not at hogwarts said harry still looking fixedly at his knee yes he is very nosy about that said dumbledore now sounding cheerful and harry thought it safe to look up again he ha even attempted to have me followed amusing really he set dawlish to tail me it wa not kind i have already been forced to jinx dawlish once i did it again with the greatest regret so they still do not know where you go asked harry hoping for more information on this intriguing subject but dumbledore merely smiled over the top of his halfmoon spectacle no they do not and the time is not quite right for you to know either now i suggest we press on unless there is anything else there is actually sir said harry it about malfoy and snape professor snape harry yes sir i overheard them during professor slughorns party well i followed them actually page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore listened to harrys story with an impassive face when harry had finished he did not speak for a few moment then said thank you for telling me this harry but i suggest that you put it out of your mind i do not think that it is of great importance not of great importance repeated harry incredulously professor did you understand yes harry blessed a i am with extraordinary brainpower i understood everything you told me said dumbledore a little sharply i think you might even consider the possibility that i understood more than you did again i am glad that you have confided in me but let me reassure you that you have not told me anything that cause me disquiet harry sat in seething silence glaring at dumbledore what wa going on did this mean that dumbledore had indeed ordered snape to find out what malfoy wa doing in which case he had already heard everything harry had just told him from snape or wa he really worried by what he had heard but pretending not to be so sir said harry in what he hoped wa a polite calm voice you definitely still trust i have been tolerant enough to answer that question already said dumbledore but he did not sound very tolerant anymore my answer ha not changed i should think not said a snide voice phineas nigellus wa evidently only pretending to be asleep dumbledore ignored him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and now harry i must insist that we press on i have more important thing to discus with you this evening harry sat there feeling mutinous how would it be if he refused to permit the change of subject if he insisted upon arguing the case against malfoy a though he had read harrys mind dumbledore shook his head ah harry how often this happens even between the best of friend each of u belief that what he ha to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute i do not think what you have got to say is unimportant sir said harry stiffly well you are quite right because it is not said dumbledore briskly i have two more memory to show you this evening both obtained with enormous difficulty and the second of them is i think the most important i have collected harry did not say anything to this he still felt angry at the reception his confidence had received but could not see what wa to be gained by arguing further so said dumbledore in a ringing voice we meet this evening to continue the tale of tom riddle whom we left last lesson poised on the threshold of his year at hogwarts you will remember how excited he wa to hear that he wa a wizard that he refused my company on a trip to diagon alley and that i in turn warned him against continued thievery when he arrived at school page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well the start of the school year arrived and with it came tom riddle a quiet boy in his secondhand robe who lined up with the other first year to be sorted he wa placed in slytherin house almost the moment that the sorting hat touched his head continued dumbledore waving his blackened hand toward the shelf over his head where the sorting hat sat ancient and unmoving how soon riddle learned that the famous founder of the house could talk to snake i do not know perhaps that very evening the knowledge can only have excited him and increased his sense of selfimportance however if he wa frightening or impressing fellow slytherins with display of parseltongue in their common room no hint of it reached the staff he showed no sign of outward arrogance or aggression at all a an unusually talented and very goodlooking orphan he naturally drew attention and sympathy from the staff almost from the moment of his arrival he seemed polite quiet and thirsty for knowledge nearly all were most favorably impressed by him did not you tell them sir what he would been like when you met him at the orphanage asked harry no i did not though he had shown no hint of remorse it wa possible that he felt sorry for how he had behaved before and wa resolved to turn over a fresh leaf i chose to give him that chance dumbledore paused and looked inquiringly at harry who had opened his mouth to speak here again wa dumbledore s tendency to trust people in spite of overwhelming evidence that they did not deserve it but then harry remembered something but you did not really trust him sir did you he told me the riddle who came out of that diary said page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore never seemed to like me a much a the other teacher did let u say that i did not take it for granted that he wa trustworthy said dumbledore i had a i have already indicated resolved to keep a close eye upon him and so i did i can not pretend that i gleaned a great deal from my observation at first he wa very guarded with me he felt i am sure that in the thrill of discovering his true identity he had told me a little too much he wa careful never to reveal a much again but he could not take back what he had let slip in his excitement nor what mr cole had confided in me however he had the sense never to try and charm me a he charmed so many of my colleague a he moved up the school he gathered about him a group of dedicated friend i call them that for want of a better term although a i have already indicated riddle undoubtedly felt no affection for any of them this group had a kind of dark glamour within the castle they were a motley collection a mixture of the weak seeking protection the ambitious seeking some shared glory and the thuggish gravitating toward a leader who could show them more refined form of cruelty in other word they were the forerunner of the death eater and indeed some of them became the first death eater after leaving hogwarts rigidly controlled by riddle they were never detected in open wrongdoing although their seven year at hogwarts were marked by a number of nasty incident to which they were never satisfactorily linked the most serious of which wa of course the opening of the chamber of secret which resulted in the death of a girl a you know hagrid wa wrongly accused of that crime page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i have not been able to find many memory of riddle at hogwarts said dumbledore placing his withered hand on the pensieve few who knew him then are prepared to talk about him they are too terrified what i know i found out after he had left hogwarts after much painstaking effort after tracing those few who could be tricked into speaking after searching old record and questioning muggle and wizard witness alike those whom i could persuade to talk told me that riddle wa obsessed with his parentage this is understandable of course he had grown up in an orphanage and naturally wished to know how he came to be there it seems that he searched in vain for some trace of tom riddle senior on the shield in the trophy room on the list of prefect in the old school record even in the book of wizarding history finally he wa forced to accept that his father had never set foot in hogwarts i believe that it wa then that he dropped the name forever assumed the identity of lord voldemort and began his investigation into his previously despised mother family the woman whom you will remember he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death all he had to go upon wa the single name marvolo which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother father name finally after painstaking research through old book of wizarding family he discovered the existence of slytherins surviving line in the summer of his sixteenth year he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his gaunt relative and now harry if you will stand page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore rose and harry saw that he wa again holding a small crystal bottle filled with swirling pearly memory i wa very lucky to collect this he said a he poured the gleaming mass into the pensieve a you will understand when we have experienced it shall we harry stepped up to the stone basin and bowed obediently until his face sank through the surface of the memory he felt the familiar sensation of falling through nothingness and then landed upon a dirty stone floor in almost total darkness it took him several second to recognize the place by which time dumbledore had landed beside him the gaunts house wa now more indescribably filthy than anywhere harry had ever seen the ceiling wa thick with cobweb the floor coated in grime moldy and rotting food lay upon the table amidst a mass of crusted pot the only light came from a single guttering candle placed at the foot of a man with hair and beard so overgrown harry could see neither eye nor mouth he wa slumped in an armchair by the fire and harry wondered for a moment whether he wa dead but then there came a loud knock on the door and the man jerked awake raising a wand in his right hand and a short knife in his left the door creaked open there on the threshold holding an oldfashioned lamp stood a boy harry recognized at once tall pale darkhaired and handsome the teenage voldemort voldemorts eye moved slowly around the hovel and then found the man in the armchair for a few second they looked at each other then the man page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling staggered upright the many empty bottle at his foot clattering and tinkling across the floor you he bellowed you and he hurtled drunkenly at riddle wand and knife held aloft stop riddle spoke in parseltongue the man skidded into the table sending moldy pot crashing to the floor he stared at riddle there wa a long silence while they contemplated each other the man broke it you speak it yes i speak it said riddle he moved forward into the room allowing the door to swing shut behind him harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for voldemorts complete lack of fear his face merely expressed disgust and perhaps disappointment where is marvolo he asked dead said the other died year ago did not he riddle frowned who are you then i am morfin are not marvolo s son course i am then page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling morfin pushed the hair out of his dirty face the better to see riddle and harry saw that he wore marvolos blackstoned ring on his right hand i thought you wa that muggle whispered morfin you look mighty like that muggle what muggle said riddle sharply that muggle what my sister took a fancy to that muggle what life in the big house over the way said morfin and he spat unexpectedly upon the floor between them you look right like him riddle but he older now in e he oldern you now i think on it morfin looked slightly dazed and swayed a little still clutching the edge of the table for support he come back see he added stupidly voldemort wa gazing at morfin a though appraising his possibility now he moved a little closer and said riddle came back ar he left her and serve her right marrying filth said morfin spitting on the floor again robbed u mind before she ran off where is the locket eh where is slytherins locket voldemort did not answer morfin wa working himself into a rage again he brandished his knife and shouted dishonored u she did that little slut and whore you coming here and asking question about all that it over is it not it over he looked away staggering slightly and voldemort moved forward a he did so an unnatural darkness fell extinguishing voldemorts lamp and morfin s candle extinguishing everything page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledores finger closed tightly around harrys arm and they were soaring back into the present again the soft golden light in dumbledores office seemed to dazzle harrys eye after that impenetrable darkness is that all said harry at once why did it go dark what happened because morfin could not remember anything from that point onward said dumbledore gesturing harry back into his seat when he awoke next morning he wa lying on the floor quite alone marvolos ring had gone meanwhile in the village of little hangleton a maid wa running along the high street screaming that there were three body lying in the drawing room of the big house tom riddle senior and his mother and father the muggle authority were perplexed a far a i am aware they do not know to this day how the riddle died for the avada kedavra curse doe not usually leave any sign of damage the exception sits before me dumbledore added with a nod to harrys scar the ministry on the other hand knew at once that this wa a wizard murder they also knew that a convicted mugglehater lived across the valley from the riddle house a mugglehater who had already been imprisoned once for attacking one of the murdered people so the ministry called upon morfin they did not need to question him to use veritaserum or legilimency he admitted to the murder on the spot giving detail only the murderer could know he wa proud he said to have killed the muggles had been awaiting his chance all these year he handed over page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling his wand which wa proved at once to have been used to kill the riddle and he permitted himself to be led off to azkaban without a fight all that disturbed him wa the fact that his father ring had disappeared hell kill me for losing it he told his captor over and over again hell kill me for losing his ring and that apparently wa all he ever said again he lived out the remainder of his life in azkaban lamenting the loss of marvolos last heirloom and is buried beside the prison alongside the other poor soul who have expired within it wall so voldemort stole morfins wand and used it said harry sitting up straight that is right said dumbledore we have no memory to show u this but i think we can be fairly sure what happened voldemort stupefied his uncle took his wand and proceeded across the valley to the big house over the way there he murdered the muggle man who had abandoned his witch mother and for good measure his muggle grandparent thus obliterating the last of the unworthy riddle line and revenging himself upon the father who never wanted him then he returned to the gaunt hovel performed the complex bit of magic that would implant a false memory in his uncle mind laid morfins wand beside it unconscious owner pocketed the ancient ring he wore and departed and morfin never realized he had not done it never said dumbledore he gave a i say a full and boastful confession but he had this real memory in him all the time page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yes but it took a great deal of skilled legilimency to coax it out of him said dumbledore and why should anybody delve further into morfins mind when he had already confessed to the crime however i wa able to secure a visit to morfin in the last week of his life by which time i wa attempting to discover a much a i could about voldemorts past i extracted this memory with difficulty when i saw what it contained i attempted to use it to secure morfins release from azkaban before the ministry reached their decision however morfin had died but how come the ministry did not realize that voldemort had done all that to morfin harry asked angrily he wa underage at the time wa not he i thought they could detect underage magic you are quite right they can detect magic but not the perpetrator you will remember that you were blamed by the ministry for the hover charm that wa in fact cast by dobby growled harry this injustice still rankled so if you are underage and you do magic inside an adult witch or wizard house the ministry will not know they will certainly be unable to tell who performed the magic said dumbledore smiling slightly at the look of great indignation on harrys face they rely on witch and wizard parent to enforce their offspring obedience while within their wall well that is rubbish snapped harry look what happened here look what happened to morfin i agree said dumbledore whatever morfin wa he did not deserve to die a he did blamed for murder page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he had not committed but it is getting late and i want you to see this other memory before we part dumbledore took from an inside pocket another crystal phial and harry fell silent at once remembering that dumbledore had said it wa the most important one he had collected harry noticed that the content proved difficult to empty into the pensieve a though they had congealed slightly did memory go bad this will not take long said dumbledore when he had finally emptied the phial we shall be back before you know it once more into the pensieve then and harry fell again through the silver surface landing this time right in front of a man he recognized at once it wa a much younger horace slughorn harry wa so used to him bald that he found the sight of slughorn with thick shiny strawcolored hair quite disconcerting it looked a though he had had his head thatched though there wa already a shiny galleonsized bald patch on his crown his mustache le massive than it wa these day wa gingery blond he wa not quite a rotund a the slughorn harry knew though the golden button on his richly embroidered waistcoat were taking a fair amount of strain his little foot resting upon a velvet pouffe he wa sitting well back in a comfortable winged armchair one hand grasping a small glass of wine the other searching through a box of crystalized pineapple harry looked around a dumbledore appeared beside him and saw that they were standing in slughorn s office half a dozen boy were sitting around page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling slughorn all on harder or lower seat than his and all in their midteens harry recognized voldemort at once his wa the most handsome face and he looked the most relaxed of all the boy his right hand lay negligently upon the arm of his chair with a jolt harry saw that he wa wearing marvolos goldand black ring he had already killed his father sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring he asked tom tom if i knew i could not tell you said slughorn wagging a reproving sugarcovered finger at riddle though ruining the effect slightly by winking i must say id like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are riddle smiled the other boy laughed and cast him admiring look what with your uncanny ability to know thing you should not and your careful flattery of the people who matter thank you for the pineapple by the way you are quite right it is my favorite a several of the boy tittered something very odd happened the whole room wa suddenly filled with a thick white fog so that harry could see nothing but the face of dumbledore who wa standing beside him then slughorn s voice rang out through the mist unnaturally loudly you will go wrong boy mark my word the fog cleared a suddenly a it had appeared and yet nobody made any allusion to it nor did anybody look a though anything unusual had just happened bewildered harry looked around a a small golden page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling clock standing upon slughorns desk chimed eleven of the clock good gracious is it that time already said slughorn you would better get going boy or well all be in trouble lestrange i want your essay by tomorrow or it detention same go for you avery slughorn pulled himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk a the boy filed out voldemort however stayed behind harry could tell he had dawdled deliberately wanting to be last in the room with slughorn look sharp tom said slughorn turning around and finding him still present you do not want to be caught out of bed out of hour and you a prefect sir i wanted to ask you something ask away then mboy ask away sir i wondered what you know about about horcruxes and it happened all over again the dense fog filled the room so that harry could not see slughorn or voldemort at all only dumbledore smiling serenely beside him then slughorns voice boomed out again just a it had done before i do not know anything about horcruxes and i would not tell you if i did now get out of here at once and do not let me catch you mentioning them again well that is that said dumbledore placidly beside harry time to go page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and harrys foot left the floor to fall second later back onto the mg in front of dumbledores desk that is all there is said harry blankly dumbledore had said that this wa the most important memory of all but he could not see what wa so significant about it admittedly the fog and the fact that nobody seemed to have noticed it wa odd but other than that nothing seemed to have happened except that voldemort had asked a question and failed to get an answer a you might have noticed said dumbledore reseating himself behind his desk that memory ha been tampered with tampered with repeated harry sitting back down too certainly said dumbledore professor slughorn ha meddled with his own recollection but why would he do that because i think he is ashamed of what he remembers said dumbledore he ha tried to rework the memory to show himself in a better light obliterating those part which he doe not wish me to see it is a you will have noticed very crudely done and that is all to the good for it show that the true memory is still there beneath the alteration and so for the first time i am giving you homework harry it will be your job to persuade professor slughorn to divulge the real memory which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry stared at him but surely sir he said keeping his voice a respectful a possible you do not need me you could use legilimency or veritaserum professor slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both said dumbledore he is much more accomplished at occlumency than poor morfin gaunt and i would be astonished if he ha not carried an antidote to veritaserum with him ever since i coerced him into giving me this travesty of a recollection no i think it would be foolish to attempt to wrest the truth from professor slughorn by force and might do much more harm than good i do not wish him to leave hogwarts however he ha his weakness like the rest of u and i believe that you are the one person who might be able to penetrate his defense it is most important that we secure the true memory harry how important we will only know when we have seen the real thing so good luck and good night a little taken aback by the abrupt dismissal harry got to his foot quickly good night sir a he closed the study door behind him he distinctly heard phineas nigellus say i can not see why the boy should be able to do it better than you dumbledore i would not expect you to phineas replied dumbledore and fawkes gave another low musical cry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling birthday surprise the next day harry confided in both ron and hermione the task that dumbledore had set him though separately for hermione still refused to remain in ron presence longer than it took to give him a contemptuous look ron thought that harry wa unlikely to have any trouble with slughorn at all he love you he said over breakfast waving an airy forkful of fried egg will not refuse you anything will he not his little potion prince just hang back after class this afternoon and ask him hermione however took a gloomier view he must be determined to hide what really happened if dumbledore could not get it out of him she said in a low voice a they stood in the deserted snowy courtyard at break horcruxes horcruxes i have never even heard of them page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you have not harry wa disappointed he had hoped that hermione might have been able to give him a clue a to what horcruxes were they must be really advanced dark magic or why would voldemort have wanted to know about them i think it going to be difficult to get the information harry you will have to be very careful about how you approach slughorn think out a strategy ron reckons i should just hang back after potion this afternoon oh well if wonwon think that you would better do it she said flaring up at once after all when ha won won judgment ever been faulty hermione can not you ivo she said angrily and stormed away leaving harry alone and ankledeep in snow potion lesson were uncomfortable enough these day seeing a harry ron and hermione had to share a desk today hermione moved her cauldron around the table so that she wa close to ernie and ignored both harry and ron what have you done ron muttered to harry looking at hermione s haughty profile but before harry could answer slughorn wa calling for silence from the front of the room settle down settle down please quickly now lot of work to get through this afternoon golpalotts third law who can tell me but miss granger can of course page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hermione recited at top speed golpalottsthird lawstatesthattheantidoteforablendedpoison willbeequaltomorethanthesumoftheantidotes foreachoftheseparatecomponents precisely beamed slughorn ten point for gryffindor now if we accept golpalotts third law a true harry wa going to have to take slughorn s word for it that golpalotts third law wa true because he had not understood any of it nobody apart from hermione seemed to be following what slughorn said next either which mean of course that assuming we have achieved correct identification of the potion ingredient by scarpins revelaspell our primary aim is not the relatively simple one of selecting antidote to those ingredient in and of themselves but to find that added component that will by an almost alchemical process transform these disparate element ron wa sitting beside harry with his mouth half open doodling absently on his new copy of advanced potionmaking ron kept forgetting that he could no longer rely on hermione to help him out of trouble when he failed to grasp what wa going on and so finished slughorn i want each of you to come and take one of these phial from my desk you are to create an antidote for the poison within it before the end of the lesson good luck and do not forget your protective glove hermione had left her stool and wa halfway toward slughorn s desk before the rest of the class had realized it wa time to move and by the time harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron and ernie returned to the table she had already tipped the content of her phial into her cauldron and wa kindling a fire underneath it it a shame that the prince will not be able to help you much with this harry she said brightly a she straightened up you have to understand the principle involved this time no shortcut or cheat annoyed harry uncorked the poison he had taken from slughorns desk which wa a garish shade of pink tipped it into his cauldron and lit a fire underneath it he did not have the faintest idea what he wa supposed to do next he glanced around at ron who wa now standing there looking rather gormless having copied everything harry had done you sure the prince ha not got any tip ron muttered to harry harry pulled out his trusty copy of advanced potion making and turned to the chapter on antidote there wa golpalotts third law stated word for word a hermione had recited it but not a single illuminating note in the prince hand to explain what it meant apparently the prince like hermione had had no difficulty understanding it nothing said harry gloomily hermione wa now waving her wand enthusiastically over her cauldron unfortunately they could not copy the spell she wa doing because she wa now so good at nonverbal incantation that she did not need to say the word aloud ernie macmillan however wa muttering specialis reveliol over his cauldron which sounded impressive so harry and ron hastened to imitate him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it took harry only five minute to realize that his reputation a the best potionmaker in the class wa crashing around his ear slughorn had peered hopefully into his cauldron on his first circuit of the dungeon preparing to exclaim in delight a he usually did and instead had withdrawn his head hastily coughing a the smell of bad egg overwhelmed him hermiones expression could not have been any smugger she had loathed being outperformed in every potion class she wa now decanting the mysteriously separated ingredient of her poison into ten different crystal phial more to avoid watching this irritating sight than anything else harry bent over the halfblood prince book and turned a few page with unnecessary force and there it wa scrawled right across a long list of antidote just shove a bezoar down their throat harry stared at these word for a moment had not he once long ago heard of bezoars had not snape mentioned them in their firstever potion lesson a stone taken from the stomach of a goat which will protect from most poison it wa not an answer to the golpalott problem and had snape still been their teacher harry would not have dared do it but this wa a moment for desperate measure he hastened toward the store cupboard and rummaged within it pushing aside unicorn horn and tangle of dried herb until he found at the very back a small cardboard box on which had been scribbled the word bezoars he opened the box just a slughorn called two minute left everyone inside were half a dozen page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling shriveled brown object looking more like driedup kidney than real stone harry seized one put the box back in the cupboard and hurried back to his cauldron time up called slughorn genially well let u see how you have done blaise what have you got for me slowly slughorn moved around the room examining the various antidote nobody had finished the task although hermione wa trying to cram a few more ingredient into her bottle before slughorn reached her ron had given up completely and wa merely trying to avoid breathing in the putrid fume issuing from his cauldron harry stood there waiting the bezoar clutched in a slightly sweaty hand slughorn reached their table last he sniffed ernies potion and passed on to ron with a grimace he did not linger over ron cauldron but backed away swiftly retching slightly and you harry he said what have you got to show me harry held out his hand the bezoar sitting on his palm slughorn looked down at it for a full ten second harry wondered for a moment whether he wa going to shout at him then he threw back his head and roared with laughter you have got nerve boy he boomed taking the bezoar and holding it up so that the class could see it oh you are like your mother well i can not fault you a bezoar would certainly act a an antidote to all these potion page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hermione who wa sweatyfaced and had soot on her nose looked livid her halffinished antidote comprising fiftytwo ingredient including a chunk of her own hair bubbled sluggishly behind slughorn who had eye for nobody but harry and you thought of a bezoar all by yourself did you harry she asked through gritted teeth that is the individual spirit a real potionmaker need said slughorn happily before harry could reply just like his mother she had the same intuitive grasp of potionmaking it undoubtedly from lily he get it yes harry yes if you have got a bezoar to hand of course that would do the trick although a they do not work on everything and are pretty rare it still worth knowing how to mix antidote the only person in the room looking angrier than hermione wa malfoy who harry wa pleased to see had spilled something that looked like catsick over himself before either of them could express their fury that harry had come top of the class by not doing any work however the bell rang time to pack up said slughorn and an extra ten point to gryffindor for sheer cheek still chuckling he waddled back to his desk at the front of the dungeon harry dawdled behind taking an inordinate amount of time to do up his bag neither ron nor hermione wished him luck a they left both looked rather annoyed at last harry and slughorn were the only two left in the room page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling come on now harry you will be late for your next lesson said slughorn affably snapping the gold clasp shut on his dragon skin briefcase sir said harry reminding himself irresistibly of voldemort i wanted to ask you something ask away then my dear boy ask away sir i wondered what you know about about horcruxes slughorn froze his round face seemed to sink in upon itself he licked his lip and said hoarsely what did you say i asked whether you know anything about horcruxes sir you see dumbledore put you up to this whispered slughorn his voice had changed completely it wa not genial anymore but shocked terrified he fumbled in his breast pocket and pulled out a handkerchief mopping his sweating brow dumbledores shown you that that memory well ha not he yes said harry deciding on the spot that it wa best not to lie yes of course said slughorn quietly still dabbing at his white face of course well if you have seen that memory harry you will know that i do not know anything anything he repeated the word forcefully about horcruxes he seized his dragonskin briefcase stuffed his handkerchief back into his pocket and marched to the dungeon door page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling sir said harry desperately i just thought there might be a bit more to the memory did you said slughorn then you were wrong were not you wrong he bellowed the last word and before harry could say another word slammed the dungeon door behind him neither ron nor hermione wa at all sympathetic when harry told them of this disastrous interview hermione wa still seething at the way harry had triumphed without doing the work properly ron wa resentful that harry had not slipped him a bezoar too it would have just looked stupid if wed both done it said harry irritably look i had to try and soften him up so i could ask him about voldemort did not i oh will you get a grip he added in exasperation a ron winced at the sound of the name infuriated by his failure and by ron and hermiones attitude harry brooded for the next few day over what to do next about slughorn he decided that for the time being he would let slughorn think that he had forgotten all about horcruxes it wa surely best to lull him into a false sense of security before returning to the attack when harry did not question slughorn again the potion master reverted to his usual affectionate treatment of him and appeared to have put the matter from his mind harry awaited an invitation to one of his little evening party determined to accept this time even if he had to reschedule quidditch practice unfortunately however no such invitation arrived harry checked with hermione and ginny neither of them had received an invitation and nor a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling far a they knew had anybody else harry could not help wondering whether this meant that slughorn wa not quite a forgetful a he appeared simply determined to give harry no additional opportunity to question him meanwhile the hogwarts library had failed hermione for the first time in living memory she wa so shocked she even forgot that she wa annoyed at harry for his trick with the bezoar i have not found one single explanation of what horcruxes do she told him not a single one i have been right through the restricted section and even in the most horrible book where they tell you how to brew the most gruesome potion nothing all i could find wa this in the introduction to magick moste evile listen of the horcrux wickedest of magical invention we shall not speak nor give direction i mean why mention it then she said impatiently slamming the old book shut it let out a ghostly wail oh shut up she snapped stuffing it back into her bag the snow melted around the school a february arrived to be replaced by cold dreary wetness purplishgray cloud hung low over the castle and a constant fall of chilly rain made the lawn slippery and muddy the upshot of this wa that the sixth year first apparition lesson which wa scheduled for a saturday morning so that no normal lesson would be missed took place in the great hall instead of in the ground when harry and hermione arrived in the hall ron had come down with lavender they found that the table had disappeared rain lashed against the high window and the enchanted ceiling swirled darkly above them a they assembled in front of professor page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling mcgonagall snape flitwick and sprout the head of house and a small wizard whom harry took to be the apparition instructor from the ministry he wa oddly colorless with transparent eyelash wispy hair and an insubstantial air a though a single gust of wind might blow him away harry wondered whether constant disappearance and reappearance had somehow diminished his substance or whether this frail build wa ideal for anyone wishing to vanish good morning said the ministry wizard when all the student had arrived and the head of house had called for quiet my name is wilkie twycross and i shall be your ministry apparition instructor for the next twelve week i hope to be able to prepare you for your apparition test in this time malfoy be quiet and pay attention barked professor mcgonagall everybody looked around malfoy had flushed a dull pink he looked furious a he stepped away from crabbe with whom he appeared to have been having a whispered argument harry glanced quickly at snape who also looked annoyed though harry strongly suspected that this wa le because of malfoys rudeness than the fact that mcgonagall had reprimanded one of his house by which time many of you may be ready to take your test twycross continued a though there had been no interruption a you may know it is usually impossible to apparate or disapparate within hogwarts the headmaster ha lifted this enchantment purely within the great hall for one hour so a to enable you to practice may i emphasize that you will not be page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling able to apparate outside the wall of this hall and that you would be unwise to try i would like each of you to place yourselves now so that you have a clear five foot of space in front of you there wa a great scrambling and jostling a people separated banged into each other and ordered others out of their space the head of house moved among the student marshaling them into position and breaking up argument harry where are you going demanded hermione but harry did not answer he wa moving quickly through the crowd past the place where professor flitwick wa making squeaky attempt to position a few ravenclaws all of whom wanted to be near the front past professor sprout who wa chivying the hufflepuffs into line until by dodging around ernie macmillan he managed to position himself right at the back of the crowd directly behind malfoy who wa taking advantage of the general upheaval to continue his argument with crabbe standing five foot away and looking mutinous i do not know how much longer all right malfoy shot at him oblivious to harry standing right behind him it taking longer than i thought it would crabbe opened his mouth but malfoy appeared to secondguess what he wa going to say look it none of your business what i am doing crabbe you and goyle just do a you are told and keep a lookout i tell my friend what i am up to if i want them to keep a lookout for me harry said just loud enough for malfoy to hear him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling malfoy spun around on the spot his hand flying to his wand but at that precise moment the four head of house shouted quiet and silence fell again malfoy turned slowly to face the front again thank you said twycross now then he waved his wand oldfashioned wooden hoop instantly appeared on the floor in front of every student the important thing to remember when apparating are the three d said twycross destination determination deliberation step one fix your mind firmly upon the desired destination said twycross in this case the interior of your hoop kindly concentrate upon that destination now everybody looked around furtively to check that everyone else wa staring into their hoop then hastily did a they were told harry gazed at the circular patch of dusty floor enclosed by his hoop and tried hard to think of nothing else this proved impossible a he could not stop puzzling over what malfoy wa doing that needed lookout step two said twycross focus your determination to occupy the visualized space let your yearning to enter it flood from your mind to every particle of your body harry glanced around surreptitiously a little way to his left ernie macmillan wa contemplating his hoop so hard that his face had turned pink it looked a though he wa straining to lay a quafflesized egg harry bit back a laugh and hastily returned his gaze to his own hoop page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling step three called twycross and only when i give the command turn on the spot feeling your way into nothingness moving with deliberation on my command now one harry glanced around again lot of people were looking positively alarmed at being asked to apparate so quickly two harry tried to fix his thought on his hoop again he had already forgotten what the three d stood for three harry spun on the spot lost balance and nearly fell over he wa not the only one the whole hall wa suddenly full of staggering people neville wa flat on his back ernie macmillan on the other hand had done a kind of pirouetting leap into his hoop and looked momentarily thrilled until he caught sight of dean thomas roaring with laughter at him never mind never mind said twycross dryly who did not seem to have expected anything better adjust your hoop please and back to your original position the second attempt wa no better than the first the third wa just a bad not until the fourth did anything exciting happen there wa a horrible screech of pain and everybody looked around terrified to see susan bone of hufflepuff wobbling in her hoop with her left leg still standing five foot away where she had started the head of house converged on her there wa a great bang and a puff of purple smoke which cleared page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling to reveal susan sobbing reunited with her leg but looking horrified splinching or the separation of random body part said wilkie twycross dispassionately occurs when the mind is insufficiently determined you must concentrate continuously upon your destination and move without haste but with deliberation thus twycross stepped forward turned gracefully on the spot with his arm outstretched and vanished in a swirl of robe reappearing at the back of the hall remember the three d he said and try again one two three but an hour later susans splinching wa still the most interesting thing that had happened twycross did not seem discouraged fastening his cloak at his neck he merely said until next saturday everybody and do not forget destination determination deliberation with that he waved his wand vanishing the hoop and walked out of the hall accompanied by professor mcgonagall talk broke out at once a people began moving toward the entrance hall how did you do asked ron hurrying toward harry i think i felt something the last time i tried a kind of tingling in my foot i expect your trainer are too small wonwon said a voice behind them and hermione stalked past smirking i did not feel anything said harry ignoring this interruption but i do not care about that now page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what dyou mean you do not care do not you want to learn to apparate said ron incredulously i am not fussed really i prefer flying said harry glancing over his shoulder to see where malfoy wa and speeding up a they came into the entrance hall look hurry up will you there is something i want to do perplexed ron followed harry back to the gryffindor tower at a run they were temporarily detained by peeve who had jammed a door on the fourth floor shut and wa refusing to let anyone pas until they set fire to their own pant but harry and ron simply turned back and took one of their trusted shortcut within five minute they were climbing through the portrait hole are you going to tell me what were doing then asked ron panting slightly up here said harry and he crossed the common room and led the way through the door to the boy staircase their dormitory wa a harry had hoped empty he flung open his trunk and began to rummage in it while ron watched impatiently harry malfoy s using crabbe and goyle a lookout he wa arguing with crabbe just now i want to know aha he had found it a folded square of apparently blank parchment which he now smoothed out and tapped with the tip of his wand page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i solemnly swear that i am up to no good or malfoy is anyway at once the marauder map appeared on the parchment surface here wa a detailed plan of every one of the castle floor and moving around it the tiny labeled black dot that signified each of the castle occupant help me find malfoy said harry urgently he laid the map upon his bed and he and ron leaned over it searching there said ron after a minute or so he in the slytherin common room look with parkinson and zabini and crabbe and goyle harry looked down at the map disappointed but rallied almost at once well i am keeping an eye on him from now on he said firmly and the moment i see him lurking somewhere with crabbe and goyle keeping watch outside it will be on with the old invisibility cloak and off to find out what he he broke off a neville entered the dormitory bringing with him a strong smell of singed material and began rummaging in his trunk for a fresh pair of pant despite his determination to catch malfoy out harry had no luck at all over the next couple of week although he consulted the map a often a he could sometimes making unnecessary visit to the bathroom between lesson to search it he did not once see malfoy anywhere suspicious admittedly he spotted crabbe and goyle moving around the castle on their own more often than usual sometimes page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling remaining stationary in deserted corridor but at these time malfoy wa not only nowhere near them but impossible to locate on the map at all this wa most mysterious harry toyed with the possibility that malfoy wa actually leaving the school ground but could not see how he could be doing it given the very high level of security now operating within the castle he could only suppose that he wa missing malfoy amongst the hundred of tiny black dot upon the map a for the fact that malfoy crabbe and goyle appeared to be going their different way when they were usually inseparable these thing happened a people got older ron and hermione harry reflected sadly were living proof february moved toward march with no change in the weather except that it became windy a well a wet to general indignation a sign went up on all common room notice board that the next trip into hogsmeade had been canceled ron wa furious it wa on my birthday he said i wa looking forward to that not a big surprise though is it said harry not after what happened to katie she had still not returned from st mungos what wa more further disappearance had been reported in the daily prophet including several relative of student at hogwarts but now all i have got to look forward to is stupid apparition said ron grumpily big birthday treat three lesson on apparition wa proving a difficult a ever though a few more people had managed to splinch themselves frustration wa running high and there wa a certain amount of illfeeling toward page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling wilkie twycross and his three d which had inspired a number of nickname for him the politest of which were dogbreath and dunghead happy birthday ron said harry when they were woken on the first of march by seamus and dean leaving noisily for breakfast have a present he threw the package across onto ron bed where it joined a small pile of them that must harry assumed have been delivered by houseelves in the night cheer said ron drowsily and a he ripped off the paper harry got out of bed opened his own trunk and began rummaging in it for the marauder map which he hid after every use he turfed out half the content of his trunk before he found it hiding beneath the rolledup sock in which he wa still keeping his bottle of lucky potion felix felicis right he murmured taking it back to bed with him tapping it quietly and murmuring i solemnly swear that i am up to no good so that neville who wa passing the foot of his bed at the time would not hear nice one harry said ron enthusiastically waving the new pair of quidditch keeper glove harry had given him no problem said harry absentmindedly a he searched the slytherin dormitory closely for malfoy hey i do not think he in his bed ron did not answer he wa too busy unwrapping present every now and then letting out an exclamation of pleasure page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling seriously good haul this year he announced holding up a heavy gold watch with odd symbol around the edge and tiny moving star instead of hand see what mum and dad got me blimey i think ill come of age next year too cool muttered harry sparing the watch a glance before peering more closely at the map where wa malfoy he did not seem to be at the slytherin table in the great hall eating breakfast he wa nowhere near snape who wa sitting in his study he wa not in any of the bathroom or in the hospital wing want one said ron thickly holding out a box of chocolate cauldron no thanks said harry looking up malfoys gone again can not have done said ron stuffing a second cauldron into his mouth a he slid out of bed to get dressed come on if you do not hurry up you will have to apparate on an empty stomach might make it easier i suppose ron looked thoughtfully at the box of chocolate cauldron then shrugged and helped himself to a third harry tapped the map with his wand muttered mischief managed though it had not been and got dressed thinking hard there had to be an explanation for malfoys periodic disappearance but he simply could not think what it could be the best way of finding out would be to tail him but even with the invisibility cloak this wa an impractical idea harry had lesson quidditch practice homework and apparition he could not follow malfoy around school all day without his absence being remarked upon page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ready he said to ron he wa halfway to the dormitory door when he realized that ron had not moved but wa leaning on his bedpost staring out of the rainwashed window with a strangely unfocused look on his face ron breakfast i am not hungry harry stared at him i thought you just said well all right ill come down with you sighed ron but i do not want to eat harry scrutinized him suspiciously you have just eaten half a box of chocolate cauldron have not you it not that ron sighed again you you would not understand fair enough said harry albeit puzzled a he turned to open the door harry said ron suddenly what harry i can not stand it you can not stand what asked harry now starting to feel definitely alarmed ron wa rather pale and looked a though he wa about to be sick page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i can not stop thinking about her said ron hoarsely harry gaped at him he had not expected this and wa not sure he wanted to hear it friend they might be but if ron started calling lavender lavlav he would have to put his foot down why doe that stop you having breakfast harry asked trying to inject a note of common sense into the proceeding i do not think she know i exist said ron with a desperate gesture she definitely know you exist said harry bewildered she keep snogging you doe not she ron blinked who are you talking about who are you talking about said harry with an increasing sense that all reason had dropped out of the conversation romilda vane said ron softly and his whole face seemed to illuminate a he said it a though hit by a ray of purest sunlight they stared at each other for almost a whole minute before harry said this is a joke right you are joking i think harry i think i love her said ron in a strangled voice okay said harry walking up to ron to get a better look at the glazed eye and the pallid complexion okay say that again with a straight face page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i love her repeated ron breathlessly have you seen her hair it all black and shiny and silky and her eye her big dark eye and her this is really funny and everything said harry impatiently but joke over all right drop it he turned to leave he had got two step toward the door when a crashing blow hit him on the right ear staggering he looked around ron fist wa drawn right back his face wa contorted with rage he wa about to strike again harry reacted instinctively his wand wa out of his pocket and the incantation sprang to mind without conscious thought levicorpus ron yelled a his heel wa wrenched upward once more he dangled helplessly upside down his robe hanging off him what wa that for harry bellowed you insulted her harry you said it wa a joke shouted ron who wa slowly turning purple in the face a all the blood rushed to his head this is insane said harry what is got into and then he saw the box lying open on ron bed and the truth hit him with the force of a stampeding troll where did you get those chocolate cauldron they were a birthday present shouted ron revolving slowly in midair a he struggled to get free i offered you one did not i page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you just picked them up off the floor did not you they would fallen off my bed all right let me go they did not fall off your bed you prat do not you understand they were mine i chucked them out of my trunk when i wa looking for the map they are the chocolate cauldron romilda gave me before christmas and they are all spiked with love potion but only one word of this seemed to have registered with ron romilda he repeated did you say romilda harry do you know her can you introduce me harry stared at the dangling ron whose face now looked tremendously hopeful and fought a strong desire to laugh a part of him the part closest to his throbbing right ear wa quite keen on the idea of letting ron down and watching him run amok until the effect of the potion wore off but on the other hand they were supposed to be friend ron had not been himself when he had attacked and harry thought that he would deserve another punching if he permitted ron to declare undying love for romilda vane yeah ill introduce you said harry thinking fast i am going to let you down now okay he sent ron crashing back to the floor his ear did hurt quite a lot but ron simply bounded to his foot again grinning she will be in slughorns office said harry confidently leading the way to the door page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling why will she be in there asked ron anxiously hurrying to keep up oh she ha extra potion lesson with him said harry inventing wildly maybe i could ask if i can have them with her said ron eagerly great idea said harry lavender wa waiting beside the portrait hole a complication harry had not foreseen you are late wonwon she pouted i have got you a birthday leave me alone said ron impatiently harrys going to introduce me to romilda vane and without another word to her he pushed his way out of the portrait hole harry tried to make an apologetic face to lavender but it might have turned out simply amused because she looked more offended than ever a the fat lady swung shut behind them harry had been slightly worried that slughorn might be at breakfast but he answered his office door at the first knock wearing a green velvet dressing gown and matching nightcap and looking rather blearyeyed harry he mumbled this is very early for a call i generally sleep late on a saturday professor i am really sorry to disturb you said harry a quietly a possible while ron stood on tiptoe attempting to see past slughorn into his room but my friend ron swallowed a love potion by mistake page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you could not make him an antidote could you id take him to madam pomfrey but were not supposed to have anything from weasleys wizard wheeze and you know awkward question id have thought you could have whipped him up a remedy harry an expert potioneer like you asked slughorn er said harry somewhat distracted by the fact that ron wa now elbowing him in the rib in an attempt to force his way into the room well i have never mixed an antidote for a love potion sir and by the time i get it right ron might have done something serious helpfully ron chose this moment to moan i can not see her harry is he hiding her wa this potion within date asked slughorn now eyeing ron with professional interest they can strengthen you know the longer they are kept that would explain a lot panted harry now positively wrestling with ron to keep him from knocking slughorn over it his birthday professor he added imploringly oh all right come in then come in said slughorn relenting i have got the necessary here in my bag it not a difficult antidote ron burst through the door into slughorn s overheated crowded study tripped over a tasseled footstool regained his balance by seizing harry around the neck and muttered she did not see that did she page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she is not here yet said harry watching slughorn opening his potion kit and adding a few pinch of this and that to a small crystal bottle that is good said ron fervently how do i look very handsome said slughorn smoothly handing ron a glass of clear liquid now drink that up it a tonic for the nerve keep you calm when she arrives you know brilliant said ron eagerly and he gulped the antidote down noisily harry and slughorn watched him for a moment ron beamed at them then very slowly his grin sagged and vanished to be replaced by an expression of utmost horror back to normal then said harry grinning slughorn chuckled thanks a lot professor do not mention it mboy do not mention it said slughorn a ron collapsed into a nearby armchair looking devastated pickmeup that is what he need slughorn continued now bustling over to a table loaded with drink i have got butterbeer i have got wine i have got one last bottle of this oakmatured mead hmm meant to give that to dumbledore for christmas ah well he shrugged he can not miss what he never had why do not we open it now and celebrate mr weasleys birthday nothing like a fine spirit to chase away the pang of disappointed love he chortled again and harry joined in this wa the first time he had found himself almost alone with slughorn since his disastrous first attempt to extract the true memory from him perhaps if he could just page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling keep slughorn in a good mood perhaps if they got through enough of the oakmatured mead there you are then said slughorn handing harry and ron a glass of mead each before raising his own well a very happy birthday ralph ron whispered harry but ron who did not appear to be listening to the toast had already thrown the mead into his mouth and swallowed it there wa one second hardly more than a heartbeat in which harry knew there wa something terribly wrong and slughorn it seemed did not and may you have many more ron ron had dropped his glass he halfrose from his chair and then crumpled his extremity jerking uncontrollably foam wa dribbling from his mouth and his eye were bulging from their socket professor harry bellowed do something but slughorn seemed paralyzed by shock ron twitched and choked his skin wa turning blue what but spluttered slughorn harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward slughorn s open potion kit pulling out jar and pouch while the terrible sound of ron gargling breath filled the room then he found it the shriveled kidneylike stone slughorn had taken from him in potion page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he hurtled back to ron side wrenched open his jaw and thrust the bezoar into his mouth ron gave a great shudder a rattling gasp and his body became limp and still page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling elf tail so all in all not one of ron better birthday said fred it wa evening the hospital wing wa quiet the window curtained the lamp lit ron wa the only occupied bed harry hermione and ginny were sitting around him they had spent all day waiting outside the double door trying to see inside whenever somebody went in or out madam pomfrey had only let them enter at eight of the clock fred and george had arrived at ten past this is not how we imagined handing over our present said george grimly putting down a large wrapped gift on ron bedside cabinet and sitting beside ginny yeah when we pictured the scene he wa conscious said fred there we were in hogsmeade waiting to surprise him said george page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you were in hogsmeade asked ginny looking up we were thinking of buying zonkos said fred gloomily a hogsmeade branch you know but a fat lot of good it will do u if you lot are not allowed out at weekend to buy our stuff anymore but never mind that now he drew up a chair beside harry and looked at ron pale face how exactly did it happen harry harry retold the story he had already recounted it felt like a hundred time to dumbledore to mcgonagall to madam pomfrey to hermione and to ginny and then i got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit slughorn ran for help mcgonagall and madam pomfrey turned up and they brought ron up here they reckon hell be all right madam pomfrey say hell have to stay here a week or so keep taking essence of rue blimey it wa lucky you thought of a bezoar said george in a low voice lucky there wa one in the room said harry who kept turning cold at the thought of what would have happened if he had not been able to lay hand on the little stone hermione gave an almost inaudible sniff she had been exceptionally quiet all day having hurtled whitefaced up to harry outside the hospital wing and demanded to know what had happened she had taken almost no part in harry and ginnys obsessive discussion about how ron had been poisoned but merely stood beside them clenchjawed and page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling frightenedlooking until at last they had been allowed in to see him do mum and dad know fred asked ginny they have already seen him they arrived an hour ago they are in dumbledores office now but they will be back soon there wa a pause while they all watched ron mumble a little in his sleep so the poison wa in the drink said fred quietly yes said harry at once he could think of nothing else and wa glad for the opportunity to start discussing it again slughorn poured it out would he have been able to slip something into ron glass without you seeing probably said harry but why would slughorn want to poison ron no idea said fred frowning you do not think he could have mixed up the glass by mistake meaning to get you why would slughorn want to poison harry asked ginny i do not know said fred but there must be load of people who would like to poison harry must not there the chosen one and all that so you think slughorn s a death eater said ginny anythings possible said fred darkly page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he could be under the imperius curse said george or he could be innocent said ginny the poison could have been in the bottle in which case it wa probably meant for slughorn himself who would want to kill slughorn dumbledore reckons voldemort wanted slughorn on his side said harry slughorn wa in hiding for a year before he came to hogwarts and he thought of the memory dumbledore had not yet been able to extract from slughorn and maybe voldemort want him out of the way maybe he think he could be valuable to dumbledore but you said slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to dumbledore for christmas ginny reminded him so the poisoner could just a easily have been after dumbledore then the poisoner did not know slughorn very well said hermione speaking for the first time in hour and sounding a though she had a bad head cold anyone who knew slughorn would have known there wa a good chance he would keep something that tasty for himself ermynee croaked ron unexpectedly from between them they all fell silent watching him anxiously but after muttering incomprehensibly for a moment he merely started snoring the dormitory door flew open making them all jump hagrid came striding toward them his hair rainflecked his bearskin coat flapping behind him a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling crossbow in his hand leaving a trail of muddy dolphinsized footprint all over the floor bin in the forest all day he panted aragogs worse i bin readin to him didn get up ter dinner till jus now an then professor sprout told me abou ron how is he not bad said harry they say hell be okay no more than six visitor at a time said madam pomfrey hurrying out of her office hagrid make six george pointed out oh yes said madam pomfrey who seemed to have been counting hagrid a several people due to his vastness to cover her confusion she hurried off to clear up his muddy footprint with her wand i don believe this said hagrid hoarsely shaking his great shaggy head a he stared down at ron jus don believe it look at him lyin there who would want ter hurt him eh that is just what we were discussing said harry we do not know someone couldn have a grudge against the gryffindor quidditch team could they said hagrid anxiously fir katie now ron i can not see anyone trying to bump off a quidditch team said george wood might have done the slytherins if he could have got away with it said fred fairly page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well i do not think it quidditch but i think there is a connection between the attack said hermione quietly how dyou work that out asked fred well for one thing they both ought to have been fatal and were not although that wa pure luck and for another neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who wa supposed to be killed of course she added broodingly that make the person behind this even more dangerous in a way because they do not seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim before anybody could respond to this ominous pronouncement the dormitory door opened again and mr and mr weasley hurried up the ward they had done no more than satisfy themselves that ron would make a full recovery on their last visit to the ward now mr weasley seized hold of harry and hugged him very tightly dumbledores told u how you saved him with the bezoar she sobbed oh harry what can we say you saved ginny you saved arthur now you have saved ron do not be i did not muttered harry awkwardly half our family doe seem to owe you their life now i stop and think about it mr weasley said in a constricted voice well all i can say is that it wa a lucky day for the weasleys when ron decided to sit in your compartment on the hogwarts express harry harry could not think of any reply to this and wa almost glad when madam pomfrey reminded them that there were only supposed to be six visitor around ron bed he and hermione rose at once to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling leave and hagrid decided to go with them leaving ron with his family it terrible growled hagrid into his beard a the three of them walked back along the corridor to the marble staircase all this new security an kid are still gettin hurt dumbledores worried sick he don say much but i can tell ha not he got any idea hagrid asked hermione desperately i spect he got hundred of idea brain like his said hagrid but he doesn know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine or they would ve bin caught wouldn they wha worry me said hagrid lowering his voice and glancing over his shoulder harry for good measure checked the ceiling for peeve is how long hogwarts can stay open if kid are bein attacked chamber o secret all over again isn it there will be panic more parent takin their kid outta school an nex thing yeh know the board o governor hagrid stopped talking a the ghost of a longhaired woman drifted serenely past then resumed in a hoarse whisper the board o governorsll be talkin about shuttin u up fer good surely not said hermione looking worried got to see it from their point o view said hagrid heavily i mean it always bin a bit of a risk sendin a kid ter hogwarts hasn it yer expect accident don yeh with hundred of underage wizard all locked up tergether but attempted murder thas diffrent sno wonder dumbledores angry with sn page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hagrid stopped in his track a familiar guilty expression on what wa visible of his face above his tangled black beard what said harry quickly dumbledores angry with snape i never said tha said hagrid though his look of panic could not have been a bigger giveaway look at the time it gettin on fer midnight i need ter hagrid why is dumbledore angry with snape harry asked loudly shhhh said hagrid looking both nervous and angry don shout stuff like that harry dyeh wan me ter lose me job mind i don suppose yehd care would yeh not now yehve given up care of mag do not try and make me feel guilty it will not work said harry forcefully what is snape done i do not know harry i shouldnta heard it at all i well i wa cornin outta the forest the other evenin an i overheard them talking well arguin did not like ter draw attention to meself so i sorta skulked an tried not ter listen but it wa a well a heated discussion an it wasn easy ter block it out well harry urged him a hagrid shuffled his enormous foot uneasily well i jus heard snape sayin dumbledore took too much fer granted an maybe he snape didn wan ter do it anymore do what page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i do not know harry it sounded like snape wa feelin a bit overworked thas all anyway dumbledore told him flat out he would agreed ter do it an that wa all there wa to it pretty firm with him an then he said summat abou snape makin investigation in his house in slytherin well there is nothin strange abou that hagrid added hastily a harry and hermione exchanged look full of meaning all the head o house were asked ter look inter that necklace business yeah but dumbledore s not having row with the rest of them is he said harry look hagrid twisted his crossbow uncomfortably in his hand there wa a loud splintering sound and it snapped in two i know what yehre like abou snape harry an i don want yeh ter go readin more inter this than there is look out said hermione tersely they turned just in time to see the shadow of argus filch looming over the wall behind them before the man himself turned the corner hunchbacked his jowl aquiver oho he wheezed out of bed so late this will mean detention no it won filch said hagrid shortly they are with me aren they and what difference doe that make asked filch obnoxiously i am a ruddy teacher aren i yeh sneakin squib said hagrid firing up at once page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there wa a nasty hissing noise a filch swelled with fury mr norris had arrived unseen and wa twisting herself sinuously around filchs skinny ankle get goin said hagrid out of the corner of his mouth harry did not need telling twice he and hermione both hurried off hagrids and filchs raised voice echoed behind them a they ran they passed peeve near the turning into gryffindor tower but he wa streaking happily toward the source of the yelling cackling and calling when there is strife and when there is trouble call on peevsie hell make double the fat lady wa snoozing and not pleased to be woken but swung forward grumpily to allow them to clamber into the mercifully peaceful and empty common room it did not seem that people knew about ron yet harry wa very relieved he had been interrogated enough that day hermione bade him good night and set off for the girl dormitory harry however remained behind taking a seat beside the fire and looking down into the dying ember so dumbledore had argued with snape in spite of all he had told harry in spite of his insistence that he trusted snape completely he had lost his temper with him he did not think that snape had tried hard enough to investigate the slytherins or perhaps to investigate a single slytherin malfoy wa it because dumbledore did not want harry to do anything foolish to take matter into his own hand that he had pretended there wa nothing in harrys suspicion that seemed likely it might even be that page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore did not want anything to distract harry from their lesson or from procuring that memory from slughorn perhaps dumbledore did not think it right to confide suspicion about his staff to sixteen yearolds there you are potter harry jumped to his foot in shock his wand at the ready he had been quite convinced that the common room wa empty he had not been at all prepared for a hulking figure to rise suddenly out of a distant chair a closer look showed him that it wa cormac mclaggen i have been waiting for you to come back said mclaggen disregarding harrys drawn wand must have fallen asleep look i saw them taking weasley up to the hospital wing earlier did not look like hell be fit for next week match it took harry a few moment to realize what mclaggen wa talking about oh right quidditch he said putting his wand back into the belt of his jean and running a hand wearily through his hair yeah he might not make it well then ill be playing keeper will not i said mclaggen yeah said harry yeah i suppose so he could not think of an argument against it after all mclaggen had certainly performed secondbest in the trial page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling excellent said mclaggen in a satisfied voice so when is practice what oh there is one tomorrow evening good listen potter we should have a talk beforehand i have got some idea on strategy you might find useful right said harry unenthusiastically well ill hear them tomorrow then i am pretty tired now see you the news that ron had been poisoned spread quickly next day but it did not because the sensation that katies attack had done people seemed to think that it might have been an accident given that he had been in the potion master room at the time and that a he had been given an antidote immediately there wa no real harm done in fact the gryffindors were generally much more interested in the upcoming quidditch match against hufflepuff for many of them wanted to see zacharias smith who played chaser on the hufflepuff team punished soundly for his commentary during the opening match against slytherin harry however had never been le interested in quidditch he wa rapidly becoming obsessed with draco malfoy still checking the marauder map whenever he got a chance he sometimes made detour to wherever malfoy happened to be but had not yet detected him doing anything out of the ordinary and still there were those inexplicable time when malfoy simply vanished from the map but harry did not get a lot of time to consider the problem what with quidditch practice homework page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and the fact that he wa now being dogged wherever he went by cormac mclaggen and lavender brown he could not decide which of them wa more annoying mclaggen kept up a constant stream of hint that he would make a better permanent keeper for the team than ron and that now that harry wa seeing him play regularly he would surely come around to this way of thinking too he wa also keen to criticize the other player and provide harry with detailed training scheme so that more than once harry wa forced to remind him who wa captain meanwhile lavender kept sidling up to harry to discus ron which harry found almost more wearing than mclaggens quidditch lecture at first lavender had been very annoyed that nobody had thought to tell her that ron wa in the hospital wing i mean i am his girlfriend but unfortunately she had now decided to forgive harry this lapse of memory and wa keen to have lot of indepth chat with him about ron feeling a most uncomfortable experience that harry would have happily forgone look why do not you talk to ron about all this harry asked after a particularly long interrogation from lavender that took in everything from precisely what ron had said about her new dress robe to whether or not harry thought that ron considered his relationship with lavender to be serious well i would but he always asleep when i go and see him said lavender fretfully is he said harry surprised for he had found ron perfectly alert every time he had been up to the hospital wing both highly interested in the news of dumbledore and snapes row and keen to abuse mclaggen a much a possible page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling is hermione granger still visiting him lavender demanded suddenly yeah i think so well they are friend are not they said harry uncomfortably friend do not make me laugh said lavender scornfully she did not talk to him for week after he started going out with me but i suppose she want to make up with him now he all interesting would you call getting poisoned being interesting asked harry anyway sorry got to go there is mclaggen coming for a talk about quidditch said harry hurriedly and he dashed sideways through a door pretending to be solid wall and sprinted down the shortcut that would take him off to potion where thankfully neither lavender nor mclaggen could follow him on the morning of the quidditch match against hufflepuff harry dropped in on the hospital wing before heading down to the pitch ron wa very agitated madam pomfrey would not let him go down to watch the match feeling it would overexcite him so how is mclaggen shaping up he asked harry nervously apparently forgetting that he had already asked the same question twice i have told you said harry patiently he could be worldclass and i would not want to keep him he keep trying to tell everyone what to do he think he could play every position better than the rest of u i can not wait to be shot of him and speaking of getting shot of people harry added getting to his foot and picking up his firebolt will you stop pretending to be asleep when lavender come to see you she is driving me mad a well page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh said ron looking sheepish yeah all right if you do not want to go out with her anymore just tell her said harry yeah well it not that easy is it said ron he paused hermione going to look in before the match he added casually no she is already gone down to the pitch with ginny oh said ron looking rather glum right well good luck hope you hammer mclag i mean smith ill try said harry shouldering his broom see you after the match he hurried down through the deserted corridor the whole school wa outside either already seated in the stadium or heading down toward it he wa looking out of the window he passed trying to gauge how much wind they were facing when a noise ahead made him glance up and he saw malfoy walking toward him accompanied by two girl both of whom looked sulky and resentful malfoy stopped short at the sight of harry then gave a short humorless laugh and continued walking where re you going harry demanded yeah i am really going to tell you because it your business potter sneered malfoy you would better hurry up they will be waiting for the chosen captain the boy who scored whatever they call you these day page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling one of the girl gave an unwilling giggle harry stared at her she blushed malfoy pushed past harry and she and her friend followed at a trot turning the corner and vanishing from view harry stood rooted on the spot and watched them disappear this wa infuriating he wa already cutting it fine to get to the match on time and yet there wa malfoy skulking off while the rest of the school wa absent harrys best chance yet of discovering what malfoy wa up to the silent second trickled past and harry remained where he wa frozen gazing at the place where malfoy had vanished where have you been demanded ginny a harry sprinted into the changing room the whole team wa changed and ready coote and peakes the beater were both hitting their club nervously against their leg i met malfoy harry told her quietly a he pulled his scarlet robe over his head so so i wanted to know how come he up at the castle with a couple of girlfriend while everyone else is down here doe it matter right now well i am not likely to find out am i said harry seizing his firebolt and pushing his glass straight come on then and without another word he marched out onto the pitch to deafening cheer and boo page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there wa little wind the cloud were patchy every now and then there were dazzling flash of bright sunlight tricky condition mclaggen said bracingly to the team coote peakes you will want to fly out of the sun so they do not see you coming i am the captain mclaggen shut up giving them instruction said harry angrily just get up by the goal post once mclaggen had marched off harry turned to coote and peakes make sure you do fly out of the sun he told them grudgingly he shook hand with the hufflepuff captain and then on madam hooch whistle kicked off and rose into the air higher than the rest of his team streaking around the pitch in search of the snitch if he could catch it good and early there might be a chance he could get back up to the castle seize the marauder map and find out what malfoy wa doing and that is smith of hufflepuff with the quaffle said a dreamy voice echoing over the ground he did the commentary last time of course and ginny weasley flew into him i think probably on purpose it looked like it smith wa being quite rude about gryffindor i expect he regret that now he playing them oh look he lost the quaffle ginny took it from him i do like her she is very nice harry stared down at the commentator podium surely nobody in their right mind would have let luna lovegood commentate but even from above page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there wa no mistaking that long dirtyblonde hair nor the necklace of butterbeer cork beside luna professor mcgonagall wa looking slightly uncomfortable a though she wa indeed having second thought about this appointment but now that big hufflepuff player got the quaffle from her i can not remember his name it something like bibble no buggins it cadwallader said professor mcgonagall loudly from beside luna the crowd laughed harry stared around for the snitch there wa no sign of it moment later cadwallader scored mclaggen had been shouting criticism at ginny for allowing the quaffle out of her possession with the result that he had not noticed the large red ball soaring past his right ear mclaggen will you pay attention to what you are supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone bellowed harry wheeling around to face his keeper you are not setting a great example mclaggen shouted back redfaced and furious and harry potter now having an argument with his keeper said luna serenely while both hufflepuffs and slytherins below in the crowd cheered and jeered i do not think that will help him find the snitch but maybe it a clever ruse swearing angrily harry spun round and set off around the pitch again scanning the sky for some sign of the tiny winged golden ball ginny and demelza scored a goal apiece giving the redandgoldclad supporter below something to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling cheer about then cadwallader scored again making thing level but luna did not seem to have noticed she appeared singularly uninterested in such mundane thing a the score and kept attempting to draw the crowd attention to such thing a interestingly shaped cloud and the possibility that zacharias smith who had so far failed to maintain possession of the quaffle for longer than a minute wa suffering from something called loser lurgy seventyforty to hufflepuff barked professor mcgonagall into luna megaphone is it already said luna vaguely oh look the gryffindor keeper got hold of one of the beater bat harry spun around in midair sure enough mclaggen for reason best known to himself had pulled peakes s bat from him and appeared to be demonstrating how to hit a bludger toward an oncoming cadwallader will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal post roared harry pelting toward mclaggen just a mclaggen took a ferocious swipe at the bludger and mishit it a blinding sickening pain a flash of light distant scream and the sensation of falling down a long tunnel and the next thing harry knew he wa lying in a remarkably warm and comfortable bed and looking up at a lamp that wa throwing a circle of golden light onto a shadowy ceiling he raised his head awkwardly there on his left wa a familiarlooking freckly redhaired person page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling nice of you to drop in said ron grinning harry blinked and looked around of course he wa in the hospital wing the sky outside wa indigo streaked with crimson the match must have finished hour ago a had any hope of cornering malfoy harrys head felt strangely heavy he raised a hand and felt a stiff turban of bandage what happened cracked skull said madam pomfrey bustling up and pushing him back against his pillow nothing to worry about i mended it at once but i am keeping you in overnight you should not overexert yourself for a few hour i do not want to stay here overnight said harry angrily sitting up and throwing back his cover i want to find mclaggen and kill him i am afraid that would come under the heading of overexertion said madam pomfrey pushing him firmly back onto the bed and raising her wand in a threatening manner you will stay here until i discharge you potter or i shall call the headmaster she bustled back into her office and harry sank back into his pillow fuming dyou know how much we lost by he asked ron through clenched teeth well yeah i do said ron apologetically final score wa three hundred and twenty to sixty brilliant said harry savagely really brilliant when i get hold of mclaggen page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you do not want to get hold of him he the size of a troll said ron reasonably personally i think there is a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the prince anyway the rest of the team might have dealt with him before you get out of here they are not happy there wa a note of badly suppressed glee in ron voice harry could tell he wa nothing short of thrilled that mclaggen had messed up so badly harry lay there staring up at the patch of light on the ceiling his recently mended skull not hurting precisely but feeling slightly tender underneath all the bandaging i could hear the match commentary from here said ron his voice now shaking with laughter i hope luna always commentates from now on loser lurgy but harry wa still too angry to see much humor in the situation and after a while ron snort subsided ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious he said after a long pause and harrys imagination zoomed into overdrive rapidly constructing a scene in which ginny weeping over his lifeless form confessed her feeling of deep attraction to him while ron gave them his blessing she reckons you only just arrived on time for the match how come you left here early enough oh said harry a the scene in his mind eye imploded yeah well i saw malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girl who did not look like they wanted to be with him and that is the second time he made sure he is not down on the quidditch pitch with the rest of the school he skipped the last match too remember harry sighed wish id followed him now the match wa such a fiasco page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling do not be stupid said ron sharply you could not have missed a quidditch match just to follow malfoy you are the captain i want to know what he up to said harry and do not tell me it all in my head not after what i overheard between him and snape i never said it wa all in your head said ron hoisting himself up on an elbow in turn and frowning at harry but there is no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place you are getting a bit obsessed with malfoy harry i mean thinking about missing a match just to follow him i want to catch him at it said harry in frustration i mean where is he going when he disappears off the map i do not know hogsmeade suggested ron yawning i have never seen him going along any of the secret passageway on the map i thought they were being watched now anyway well then i do not know said ron silence fell between them harry stared up at the circle of lamplight above him thinking if only he had rufus scrimgeours power he would have been able to set a tail upon malfoy but unfortunately harry did not have an office full of aurors at his command he thought fleetingly of trying to set something up with the da but there again wa the problem that people would be missed from lesson most of them after all still had full schedule page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there wa a low rumbling snore from ron bed after a while madam pomfrey came out of her office this time wearing a thick dressing gown it wa easiest to feign sleep harry rolled over onto his side and listened to all the curtain closing themselves a she waved her wand the lamp dimmed and she returned to her office he heard the door click behind her and knew that she wa off to bed this wa harry reflected in the darkness the third time that he had been brought to the hospital wing because of a quidditch injury last time he had fallen off his broom due to the presence of dementors around the pitch and the time before that all the bone had been removed from his arm by the incurably inept professor lockhart that had been his most painful injury by far he remembered the agony of regrowing an armful of bone in one night a discomfort not eased by the arrival of an unexpected visitor in the middle of the harry sat bolt upright his heart pounding his bandage turban askew he had the solution at last there wa a way to have malfoy followed how could he have forgotten why had not he thought of it before but the question wa how to call him what did you do quietly tentatively harry spoke into the darkness kreacher there wa a very loud crack and the sound of scuffling and squeak filled the silent room ron awoke with a yelp what is going page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry pointed his wand hastily at the door of madam pomfreys office and muttered muffliatov so that she would not come running then he scrambled to the end of his bed for a better look at what wa going on two houseelves were rolling around on the floor in the middle of the dormitory one wearing a shrunken maroon jumper and several woolly hat the other a filthy old rag strung over his hip like a loincloth then there wa another loud bang and peeve the poltergeist appeared in midair above the wrestling elf i wa watching that potty he told harry indignantly pointing at the fight below before letting out a loud cackle look at the ickle creature squabbling bitey bitey punchy punchy kreacher will not insult harry potter in front of dobby no he will not or dobby will shut kreachers mouth for him cried dobby in a highpitched voice kicky scratchy cried peeve happily now pelting bit of chalk at the elf to enrage them further tweaky pokey kreacher will say what he like about his master oh yes and what a master he is filthy friend of mudbloods oh what would poor kreachers mistress say exactly what kreachers mistress would have said they did not find out for at that moment dobby sank his knobbly little fist into kreachers mouth and knocked out half of his teeth harry and ron both leapt out of their bed and wrenched the two elf apart though they continued to try and kick and punch each other egged on by peeve who swooped page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling around the lamp squealing stick your finger up his nosey draw his cork and pull his earsies harry aimed his wand at peeve and said langlockl peeve clutched at his throat gulped then swooped from the room making obscene gesture but unable to speak owing to the fact that his tongue had just glued itself to the roof of his mouth nice one said ron appreciatively lifting dobby into the air so that his flailing limb no longer made contact with kreacher that wa another prince hex wa not it yeah said harry twisting kreachers wizened arm into a half nelson right i am forbidding you to fight each other well kreacher you are forbidden to fight dobby dobby i know i am not allowed to give you order dobby is a free houseelf and he can obey anyone he like and dobby will do whatever harry potter want him to do said dobby tear now streaming down his shriveled little face onto his jumper okay then said harry and he and ron both released the elf who fell to the floor but did not continue fighting master called me croaked kreacher sinking into a bow even a he gave harry a look that plainly wished him a painful death yeah i did said harry glancing toward madam pomfreys office door to check that the muffliato spell wa still working there wa no sign that she had heard any of the commotion i have got a job for you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling kreacher will do whatever master want said kreacher sinking so low that his lip almost touched his gnarled toe because kreacher ha no choice but kreacher is ashamed to have such a master yes dobby will do it harry potter squeaked dobby his tennisballsized eye still swimming in tear dobby would be honored to help harry potter come to think of it it would be good to have both of you said harry okay then i want you to tail draco malfoy ignoring the look of mingled surprise and exasperation on ron face harry went on i want to know where he going who he meeting and what he doing i want you to follow him around the clock yes harry potter said dobby at once his great eye shining with excitement and if dobby doe it wrong dobby will throw himself off the topmost tower harry potter there will not be any need for that said harry hastily master want me to follow the youngest of the malfoys croaked kreacher master want me to spy upon the pureblood greatnephew of my old mistress that is the one said harry foreseeing a great danger and determining to prevent it immediately and you are forbidden to tip him off kreacher or to show him what you are up to or to talk to him at all or to write him message or or to contact him in any way got it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he thought he could see kreacher struggling to see a loophole in the instruction he had just been given and waited after a moment or two and to harrys great satisfaction kreacher bowed deeply again and said with bitter resentment master think of everything and kreacher must obey him even though kreacher would much rather be the servant of the malfoy boy oh yes that is settled then said harry ill want regular report but make sure i am not surrounded by people when you turn up ron and hermione are okay and do not tell anyone what you are doing just stick to malfoy like a couple of wart plaster page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling lord voldemorts request harry and ron left the hospital wing first thing on monday morning restored to full health by the ministration of madam pomfrey and now able to enjoy the benefit of having been knocked out and poisoned the best of which wa that hermione wa friend with ron again hermione even escorted them down to breakfast bringing with her the news that ginny had argued with dean the drowsing creature in harrys chest suddenly raised it head sniffing the air hopefully what did they row about he asked trying to sound casual a they turned onto a seventhfloor corridor that wa deserted but for a very small girl who had been examining a tapestry of troll in tutu she looked terrified at the sight of the approaching sixth year and dropped the heavy brass scale she wa carrying it all right said hermione kindly hurrying forward to help her here page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she tapped the broken scale with her wand and said reparo the girl did not say thank you but remained rooted to the spot a they passed and watched them out of sight ron glanced back at her i swear they are getting smaller he said never mind her said harry a little impatiently what did ginny and dean row about hermione oh dean wa laughing about mclaggen hitting that bludger at you said hermione it must have looked funny said ron reasonably it did not look funny at all said hermione hotly it looked terrible and if coote and peakes had not caught harry he could have been very badly hurt yeah well there wa no need for ginny and dean to split up over it said harry still trying to sound casual or are they still together yes they are but why are you so interested asked hermione giving harry a sharp look i just do not want my quidditch team messed up again he said hastily but hermione continued to look suspicious and he wa most relieved when a voice behind them called harry giving him an excuse to turn his back on her oh hi luna i went to the hospital wing to find you said luna rummaging in her bag but they said you would left she thrust what appeared to be a green onion a large spotted toadstool and a considerable amount of what page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling looked like cat litter into ron hand finally pulling out a rather grubby scroll of parchment that she handed to harry i have been told to give you this it wa a small roll of parchment which harry recognized at once a another invitation to a lesson with dumbledore tonight he told ron and hermione once he had unrolled it nice commentary last match said ron to luna a she took back the green onion the toadstool and the cat litter luna smiled vaguely you are making fun of me are not you she said everyone say i wa dreadful no i am serious said ron earnestly i can not remember enjoying commentary more what is this by the way he added holding the onionlike object up to eye level oh it a gurdyroot she said stuffing the cat litter and the toadstool back into her bag you can keep it if you like i have got a few of them they are really excellent for warding off gulping plimpies and she walked away leaving ron chortling still clutching the gurdyroot you know she is grown on me luna he said a they set off again for the great hall i know she is insane but it in a good page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he stopped talking very suddenly lavender brown wa standing at the foot of the marble staircase looking thunderous hi said ron nervously cmon harry muttered to hermione and they sped past though not before they had heard lavender say why did not you tell me you were getting out today and why wa she with you ron looked both sulky and annoyed when he appeared at breakfast half an hour later and though he sat with lavender harry did not see them exchange a word all the time they were together hermione wa acting a though she wa quite oblivious to all of this but once or twice harry saw an inexplicable smirk cross her face all that day she seemed to be in a particularly good mood and that evening in the common room she even consented to look over in other word finish writing harrys herbology essay something she had been resolutely refusing to do up to this point because she had known that harry would then let ron copy his work thanks a lot hermione said harry giving her a hasty pat on the back a he checked his watch and saw that it wa nearly eight of the clock listen i have got to hurry or ill be late for dumbledore she did not answer but merely crossed out a few of his feebler sentence in a weary sort of way grinning harry hurried out through the portrait hole and off to the headmaster office the gargoyle leapt aside at the mention of toffee eclair and harry took the spiral staircase two step at a time knocking on the door just a a clock within chimed eight page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling enter called dumbledore but a harry put out a hand to push the door it wa wrenched open from inside there stood professor trelawney aha she cried pointing dramatically at harry a she blinked at him through her magnifying spectacle so this is the reason i am to be thrown unceremoniously from your office dumbledore my dear sybill said dumbledore in a slightly exasperated voice there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere but harry doe have an appointment and i really do not think there is any more to be said very well said professor trelawney in a deeply wounded voice if you will not banish the usurping nag so be it perhaps i shall find a school where my talent are better appreciated she pushed past harry and disappeared down the spiral staircase they heard her stumble halfway down and harry guessed that she had tripped over one of her trailing shawl please close the door and sit down harry said dumbledore sounding rather tired harry obeyed noticing a he took his usual seat in front of dumbledore s desk that the pensieve lay between them once more a did two more tiny crystal bottle full of swirling memory professor trelawney still is not happy firenze is teaching then harry asked no said dumbledore divination is turning out to be much more trouble than i could have foreseen never having studied the subject myself i can not ask page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling firenze to return to the forest where he is now an outcast nor can i ask sybill trelawney to leave between ourselves she ha no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle she doe not know and i think it would be unwise to enlighten her that she made the prophecy about you and voldemort you see dumbledore heaved a deep sigh then said but never mind my staffing problem we have much more important matter to discus firstly have you managed the task i set you at the end of our previous lesson ah said harry brought up short what with apparition lesson and quidditch and ron being poisoned and getting his skull cracked and his determination to find out what draco malfoy wa up to harry had almost forgotten about the memory dumbledore had asked him to extract from professor slughorn well i asked professor slughorn about it at the end of potion sir but er he would not give it to me there wa a little silence i see said dumbledore eventually peering at harry over the top of his halfmoon spectacle and giving harry the usual sensation that he wa being xrayed and you feel that you have exerted your very best effort in this matter do you that you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity that you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory well harry stalled at a loss for what to say next his single attempt to get hold of the memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble well the day ron swallowed love potion by mistake i took him to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling professor slughorn i thought maybe if i got professor slughorn in a good enough mood and did that work asked dumbledore well no sir because ron got poisoned which naturally made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory i would have expected nothing else while your best friend wa in danger once it became clear that mr weasley wa going to make a full recovery however i would have hoped that you returned to the task i set you i thought i made it clear to you how very important that memory is indeed i did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it a hot prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of harrys head all the way down his body dumbledore had not raised his voice he did not even sound angry but harry would have preferred him to yell this cold disappointment wa worse than anything sir he said a little desperately it is not that i wa not bothered or anything i have just had other other thing other thing on your mind dumbledore finished the sentence for him i see silence fell between them again the most uncomfortable silence harry had ever experienced with dumbledore it seemed to go on and on punctuated only by the little grunting snore of the portrait of armando dippet over dumbledore s head harry felt strangely diminished a though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room when he could stand it no longer he said professor page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore i am really sorry i should have done more i should have realized you would not have asked me to do it if it wa not really important thank you for saying that harry said dumbledore quietly may i hope then that you will give this matter higher priority from now on there will be little point in our meeting after tonight unless we have that memory ill do it sir ill get it from him he said earnestly then we shall say no more about it just now said dumbledore more kindly but continue with our story where we left off you remember where that wa yes sir said harry quickly voldemort killed his father and his grandparent and made it look a though his uncle morfin did it then he went back to hogwarts and he asked he asked professor slughorn about horcruxes he mumbled shamefacedly very good said dumbledore now you will remember i hope that i told you at the very outset of these meeting of ours that we would be entering the realm of guesswork and speculation yes sir thus far a i hope you agree i have shown you reasonably firm source of fact for my deduction a to what voldemort did until the age of seventeen harry nodded but now harry said dumbledore now thing become murkier and stranger if it wa difficult to find page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling evidence about the boy riddle it ha been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man voldemort in fact i doubt whether there is a soul alive apart from himself who could give u a full account of his life since he left hogwarts however i have two last memory that i would like to share with you dumbledore indicated the two little crystal bottle gleaming beside the pensieve i shall then be glad of your opinion a to whether the conclusion i have drawn from them seem likely the idea that dumbledore valued his opinion this highly made harry feel even more deeply ashamed that he had failed in the task of retrieving the horcrux memory and he shifted guiltily in his seat a dumbledore raised the first of the two bottle to the light and examined it i hope you are not tired of diving into other people memory for they are curious recollection these two he said this first one came from a very old houseelf by the name of hokey before we see what hokey witnessed i must quickly recount how lord voldemort left hogwarts he reached the seventh year of his schooling with a you might have expected top grade in every examination he had taken all around him his classmate were deciding which job they were to pursue once they had left hogwarts nearly everybody expected spectacular thing from tom riddle prefect head boy winner of the award for special service to the school i know that several teacher professor slughorn amongst them suggested that he join the ministry of magic offered to set up appointment put him in touch with useful contact he refused all offer the next thing the staff knew voldemort wa working at borgin and burke page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling at borgin and burke harry repeated stunned at borgin and burke repeated dumbledore calmly i think you will see what attraction the place held for him when we have entered hokeys memory but this wa not voldemorts first choice of job hardly anyone knew of it at the time i wa one of the few in whom the then headmaster confided but voldemort first approached professor dippet and asked whether he could remain at hogwarts a a teacher he wanted to stay here why asked harry more amazed still i believe he had several reason though he confided none of them to professor dippet said dumbledore firstly and very importantly voldemort wa i believe more attached to this school than he ha ever been to a person hogwarts wa where he had been happiest the first and only place he had felt at home harry felt slightly uncomfortable at these word for this wa exactly how he felt about hogwarts too secondly the castle is a stronghold of ancient magic undoubtedly voldemort had penetrated many more of it secret than most of the student who pas through the place but he may have felt that there were still mystery to unravel store of magic to tap and thirdly a a teacher he would have had great power and influence over young witch and wizard perhaps he had gained the idea from professor slughorn the teacher with whom he wa on best term who had demonstrated how influential a role a teacher can play i do not imagine for an instant that voldemort envisaged spending the rest of his life at page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hogwarts but i do think that he saw it a a useful recruiting ground and a place where he might begin to build himself an army but he did not get the job sir no he did not professor dippet told him that he wa too young at eighteen but invited him to reapply in a few year if he still wished to teach how did you feel about that sir asked harry hesitantly deeply uneasy said dumbledore i had advised armando against the appointment i did not give the reason i have given you for professor dippet wa very fond of voldemort and convinced of his honesty but i did not want lord voldemort back at this school and especially not in a position of power which job did he want sir what subject did he want to teach somehow harry knew the answer even before dumbledore gave it defense against the dark art it wa being taught at the time by an old professor by the name of galatea merrythought who had been at hogwarts for nearly fifty year so voldemort went off to borgin and burke and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it wa a brilliant young wizard like that working in a shop however voldemort wa no mere assistant polite and handsome and clever he wa soon given particular job of the type that only exist in a place like borgin and burke which specializes a you know harry in object with unusual and powerful page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling property voldemort wa sent to persuade people to part with their treasure for sale by the partner and he wa by all account unusually gifted at doing this ill bet he wa said harry unable to contain himself well quite said dumbledore with a faint smile and now it is time to hear from hokey the houseelf who worked for a very old very rich witch by the name of hepzibah smith dumbledore tapped a bottle with his wand the cork flew out and he tipped the swirling memory into the pensieve saying a he did so after you harry harry got to his foot and bent once more over the rippling silver content of the stone basin until his face touched them he tumbled through dark nothingness and landed in a sitting room in front of an immensely fat old lady wearing an elaborate ginger wig and a brilliant pink set of robe that flowed all around her giving her the look of a melting iced cake she wa looking into a small jeweled mirror and dabbing rouge onto her already scarlet cheek with a large powder puff while the tiniest and oldest house elf harry had ever seen laced her fleshy foot into tight satin slipper hurry up hokey said hepzibah imperiously he said he would come at four it only a couple of minute to and he never been late yet she tucked away her powder puff a the houseelf straightened up the top of the elf head barely reached the seat of hepzibah s chair and her papery skin hung off her frame just like the crisp linen sheet she wore draped like a toga page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling how do i look said hepzibah turning her head to admire the various angle of her face in the mirror lovely madam squeaked hokey harry could only assume that it wa down in hokeys contract that she must lie through her teeth when asked this question because hepzibah smith looked a long way from lovely in his opinion a tinkling doorbell rang and both mistress and elf jumped quick quick he here hokey cried hepzibah and the elf scurried out of the room which wa so crammed with object that it wa difficult to see how anybody could navigate their way across it without knocking over at least a dozen thing there were cabinet full of little lacquered box case full of goldembossed book shelf of orb and celestial globe and many flourishing potted plant in brass container in fact the room looked like a cross between a magical antique shop and a conservatory the houseelf returned within minute followed by a tall young man harry had no difficulty whatsoever in recognizing a voldemort he wa plainly dressed in a black suit his hair wa a little longer than it had been at school and his cheek were hollowed but all of this suited him he looked more handsome than ever he picked his way through the cramped room with an air that showed he had visited many time before and bowed low over hepzibah s fat little hand brushing it with his lip i brought you flower he said quietly producing a bunch of rose from nowhere page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you naughty boy you should not have squealed old hepzibah though harry noticed that she had an empty vase standing ready on the nearest little table you do spoil this old lady tom sit down sit down where is hokey ah the houseelf had come dashing back into the room carrying a tray of little cake which she set at her mistress elbow help yourself tom said hepzibah i know how you love my cake now how are you you look pale they overwork you at that shop i have said it a hundred time voldemort smiled mechanically and hepzibah simpered well what is your excuse for visiting this time she asked batting her lash mr burke would like to make an improved offer for the goblinmade armor said voldemort five hundred galleon he feel it is a more than fair now now not so fast or ill think you are only here for my trinket pouted hepzibah i am ordered here because of them said voldemort quietly i am only a poor assistant madam who must do a he is told mr burke wish me to inquire oh mr burke phooey said hepzibah waving a little hand i have something to show you that i have never shown mr burke can you keep a secret tom will you promise you will not tell mr burke i have got it he would never let me rest if he knew id shown it to you and i am not selling not to burke not to anyone but you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tom you will appreciate it for it history not how many galleon you can get for it id be glad to see anything miss hepzibah show me said voldemort quietly and hepzibah gave another girlish giggle i had hokey bring it out for me hokey where are you i want to show mr riddle our finest treasure in fact bring both while you are at it here madam squeaked the houseelf and harry saw two leather box one on top of the other moving across the room a if of their own volition though he knew the tiny elf wa holding them over her head a she wended her way between table pouffe and footstool now said hepzibah happily taking the box from the elf laying them in her lap and preparing to open the topmost one i think you will like this tom oh if my family knew i wa showing you they can not wait to get their hand on this she opened the lid harry edged forward a little to get a better view and saw what looked like a small golden cup with two finely wrought handle i wonder whether you know what it is tom pick it up have a good look whispered hepzibah and voldemort stretched out a longfingered hand and lifted the cup by one handle out of it snug silken wrapping harry thought he saw a red gleam in his dark eye his greedy expression wa curiously mirrored on hepzibahs face except that her tiny eye were fixed upon voldemorts handsome feature a badger murmured voldemort examining the engraving upon the cup then this wa page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling helga hufflepuffs a you very well know you clever boy said hepzibah leaning forward with a loud creaking of corset and actually pinching his hollow cheek did not i tell you i wa distantly descended this ha been handed down in the family for year and year lovely is not it and all sort of power it supposed to posse too but i have not tested them thoroughly i just keep it nice and safe in here she hooked the cup back off voldemorts long forefinger and restored it gently to it box too intent upon settling it carefully back into position to notice the shadow that crossed voldemorts face a the cup wa taken away now then said hepzibah happily where is hokey oh yes there you are take that away now hokey the elf obediently took the boxed cup and hepzibah turned her attention to the much flatter box in her lap i think you will like this even more tom she whispered lean in a little dear boy so you can see of course burke know i have got this one i bought it from him and i daresay he would love to get it back when i am gone she slid back the fine filigree clasp and flipped open the box there upon the smooth crimson velvet lay a heavy golden locket voldemort reached out his hand without invitation this time and held it up to the light staring at it slytherins mark he said quietly a the light played upon an ornate serpentine s page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that is right said hepzibah delighted apparently at the sight of voldemort gazing at her locket transfixed i had to pay an arm and a leg for it but i could not let it pas not a real treasure like that had to have it for my collection burke bought it apparently from a raggedlooking woman who seemed to have stolen it but had no idea of it true value there wa no mistaking it this time voldemorts eye flashed scarlet at the word and harry saw his knuckle whiten on the locket chain i daresay burke paid her a pittance but there you are pretty is not it and again all kind of power attributed to it though i just keep it nice and safe she reached out to take the locket back for a moment harry thought voldemort wa not going to let go of it but then it had slid through his finger and wa back in it red velvet cushion so there you are tom dear and i hope you enjoyed that she looked him full in the face and for the first time harry saw her foolish smile falter are you all right dear oh yes said voldemort quietly yes i am very well i thought but a trick of the light i suppose said hepzibah looking unnerved and harry guessed that she too had seen the momentary red gleam in voldemorts eye here hokey take these away and lock them up again the usual enchantment page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling time to leave harry said dumbledore quietly and a the little elf bobbed away bearing the box dumbledore grasped harry once again above the elbow and together they rose up through oblivion and back to dumbledore s office hepzibah smith died two day after that little scene said dumbledore resuming his seat and indicating that harry should do the same hokey the houseelf wa convicted by the ministry of poisoning her mistress evening cocoa by accident no way said harry angrily i see we are of one mind said dumbledore certainly there are many similarity between this death and that of the riddle in both case somebody else took the blame someone who had a clear memory of having caused the death hokey confessed she remembered putting something in her mistress cocoa that turned out not to be sugar but a lethal and littleknown poison said dumbledore it wa concluded that she had not meant to do it but being old and confused voldemort modified her memory just like he did with morfin yes that is my conclusion too said dumbledore and just a with morfin the ministry wa predisposed to suspect hokey because she wa a houseelf said harry he had rarely felt more in sympathy with the society hermione had set up spew page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling precisely said dumbledore she wa old she admitted to having tampered with the drink and nobody at the ministry bothered to inquire further a in the case of morfin by the time i traced her and managed to extract this memory her life wa almost over but her memory of course prof nothing except that voldemort knew of the existence of the cup and the locket by the time hokey wa convicted hepzibahs family had realized that two of her greatest treasure were missing it took them a while to be sure of this for she had many hiding place having always guarded her collection most jealously but before they were sure beyond doubt that the cup and the locket were both gone the assistant who had worked at borgin and burke the young man who had visited hepzibah so regularly and charmed her so well had resigned his post and vanished his superior had no idea where he had gone they were a surprised a anyone at his disappearance and that wa the last that wa seen or heard of tom riddle for a very long time now said dumbledore if you do not mind harry i want to pause once more to draw your attention to certain point of our story voldemort had committed another murder whether it wa his first since he killed the riddle i do not know but i think it wa this time a you will have seen he killed not for revenge but for gain he wanted the two fabulous trophy that poor besotted old woman showed him just a he had once robbed the other child at his orphanage just a he had stolen his uncle morfin s ring so he ran off now with hepzibahs cup and locket but said harry frowning it seems mad risking everything throwing away his job just for those page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling mad to you perhaps but not to voldemort said dumbledore i hope you will understand in due course exactly what those object meant to him harry but you must admit that it is not difficult to imagine that he saw the locket at least a rightfully his the locket maybe said harry but why take the cup a well it had belonged to another of hogwartss founder said dumbledore i think he still felt a great pull toward the school and that he could not resist an object so steeped in hogwarts history there were other reason i think i hope to be able to demonstrate them to you in due course and now for the very last recollection i have to show you at least until you manage to retrieve professor slughorns memory for u ten year separate hokeys memory and this one ten year during which we can only guess at what lord voldemort wa doing harry got to his foot once more a dumbledore emptied the last memory into the pensieve whose memory is it he asked mine said dumbledore and harry dived after dumbledore through the shifting silver mass landing in the very office he had just left there wa fawkes slumbering happily on his perch and there behind the desk wa dumbledore who looked very similar to the dumbledore standing beside harry though both hand were whole and undamaged and his face wa perhaps a little le lined the one difference between the presentday page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling office and this one wa that it wa snowing in the past bluish fleck were drifting past the window in the dark and building up on the outside ledge the younger dumbledore seemed to be waiting for something and sure enough moment after their arrival there wa a knock on the door and he said enter harry let out a hastily stifled gasp voldemort had entered the room his feature were not those harry had seen emerge from the great stone cauldron almost two year ago they were not a snakelike the eye were not yet scarlet the face not yet masklike and yet he wa no longer handsome tom riddle it wa a though his feature had been burned and blurred they were waxy and oddly distorted and the white of the eye now had a permanently bloody look though the pupil were not yet the slit that harry knew they would become he wa wearing a long black cloak and his face wa a pale a the snow glistening on his shoulder the dumbledore behind the desk showed no sign of surprise evidently this visit had been made by appointment good evening tom said dumbledore easily will not you sit down thank you said voldemort and he took the seat to which dumbledore had gestured the very seat by the look of it that harry had just vacated in the present i heard that you had become headmaster he said and his voice wa slightly higher and colder than it had been a worthy choice i am glad you approve said dumbledore smiling may i offer you a drink page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that would be welcome said voldemort i have come a long way dumbledore stood and swept over to the cabinet where he now kept the pensieve but which then wa full of bottle having handed voldemort a goblet of wine and poured one for himself he returned to the seat behind his desk so tom to what do i owe the pleasure voldemort did not answer at once but merely sipped his wine they do not call me tom anymore he said these day i am known a i know what you are known a said dumbledore smiling pleasantly but to me i am afraid you will always be tom riddle it is one of the irritating thing about old teacher i am afraid that they never quite forget their charge youthful beginning he raised his glass a though toasting voldemort whose face remained expressionless nevertheless harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly dumbledores refusal to use voldemorts chosen name wa a refusal to allow voldemort to dictate the term of the meeting and harry could tell that voldemort took it a such i am surprised you have remained here so long said voldemort after a short pause i always wondered why a wizard such a yourself never wished to leave school well said dumbledore still smiling to a wizard such a myself there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skill helping hone young page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling mind if i remember correctly you once saw the attraction of teaching too i see it still said voldemort i merely wondered why you who are so often asked for advice by the ministry and who have twice i think been offered the post of minister three time at the last count actually said dumbledore but the ministry never attracted me a a career again something we have in common i think voldemort inclined his head unsmiling and took another sip of wine dumbledore did not break the silence that stretched between them now but waited with a look of pleasant expectancy for voldemort to talk first i have returned he said after a little while later perhaps than professor dippet expected but i have returned nevertheless to request again what he once told me i wa too young to have i have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle to teach i think you must know that i have seen and done much since i left this place i could show and tell your student thing they can gain from no other wizard dumbledore considered voldemort over the top of his own goblet for a while before speaking yes i certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving u he said quietly rumor of your doings have reached your old school tom i should be sorry to believe half of them page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling voldemort s expression remained impassive a he said greatness inspires envy envy engenders spite spite spawn lie you must know this dumbledore you call it greatness what you have been doing do you asked dumbledore delicately certainly said voldemort and his eye seemed to burn red i have experimented i have pushed the boundary of magic further perhaps than they have ever been pushed of some kind of magic dumbledore corrected him quietly of some of others you remain forgive me woefully ignorant for the first time voldemort smiled it wa a taut leer an evil thing more threatening than a look of rage the old argument he said softly but nothing i have seen in the world ha supported your famous pronouncement that love is more powerful than my kind of magic dumbledore perhaps you have been looking in the wrong place suggested dumbledore well then what better place to start my fresh research than here at hogwarts said voldemort will you let me return will you let me share my knowledge with your student i place myself and my talent at your disposal i am yours to command dumbledore raised his eyebrow and what will become of those whom you command what will happen to those who call themselves or so rumor ha it the death eater page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry could tell that voldemort had not expected dumbledore to know this name he saw voldemorts eye flash red again and the slitlike nostril flare my friend he said after a moment pause will carry on without me i am sure i am glad to hear that you consider them friend said dumbledore i wa under the impression that they are more in the order of servant you are mistaken said voldemort then if i were to go to the hog head tonight i would not find a group of them nott rosier mulciber dolohov awaiting your return devoted friend indeed to travel this far with you on a snowy night merely to wish you luck a you attempted to secure a teaching post there could be no doubt that dumbledore s detailed knowledge of those with whom he wa traveling wa even le welcome to voldemort however he rallied almost at once you are omniscient a ever dumbledore oh no merely friendly with the local barman said dumbledore lightly now tom dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat the tip of his finger together in a very characteristic gesture let u speak openly why have you come here tonight surrounded by henchman to request a job we both know you do not want page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling voldemort looked coldly surprised a job i do not want on the contrary dumbledore i want it very much oh you want to come back to hogwarts but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen what is it you are after tom why not try an open request for once voldemort sneered if you do not want to give me a job of course i do not said dumbledore and i do not think for a moment you expected me to nevertheless you came here you asked you must have had a purpose voldemort stood up he looked le like tom riddle than ever his feature thick with rage this is your final word it is said dumbledore also standing then we have nothing more to say to each other no nothing said dumbledore and a great sadness filled his face the time is long gone when i could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crime but i wish i could tom i wish i could for a second harry wa on the verge of shouting a pointless warning he wa sure that voldemorts hand had twitched toward his pocket and his wand but then the moment had passed voldemort had turned away the door wa closing and he wa gone harry felt dumbledore s hand close over his arm again and moment later they were standing together page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling on almost the same spot but there wa no snow building on the window ledge and dumbledores hand wa blackened and deadlooking once more why said harry at once looking up into dumbledores face why did he come back did you ever find out i have idea said dumbledore but no more than that what idea sir i shall tell you harry when you have retrieved that memory from professor slughorn said dumbledore when you have that last piece of the jigsaw everything will i hope be clear to both of u harry wa still burning with curiosity and even though dumbledore had walked to the door and wa holding it open for him he did not move at once wa he after the defense against the dark art job again sir he did not say oh he definitely wanted the defense against the dark art job said dumbledore the aftermath of our little meeting proved that you see we have never been able to keep a defense against the dark art teacher for longer than a year since i refused the post to lord voldemort page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the unknowable room harry wracked his brain over the next week a to how he wa to persuade slughorn to hand over the true memory but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he wa reduced to doing what he did increasingly these day when at a loss poring over his potion book hoping that the prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin a he had done so many time before you will not find anything in there said hermione firmly late on sunday evening do not start hermione said harry if it had not been for the prince ron would not be sitting here now he would if you would just listened to snape in our first year said hermione dismissively harry ignored her he had just found an incantation sectumsempral scrawled in a margin above the intriguing word for enemy and wa itching to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling try it out but thought it best not to in front of hermione instead he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page they were sitting beside the fire in the common room the only other people awake were fellow sixth year there had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their apparition test those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date the twentyfirst of april had the option of signing up for additional practice session which would take place heavily supervised in hogsmeade ron had panicked on reading this notice he had still not managed to apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test hermione who had now achieved apparition twice wa a little more confident but harry who would not be seventeen for another four month could not take the test whether ready or not at least you can apparate though said ron tensely you will have no trouble come july i have only done it once harry reminded him he had finally managed to disappear and rematerialize inside his hoop during their previous lesson having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about apparition ron wa now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for snape that harry and hermione had already completed harry fully expected to receive low mark on his because he had disagreed with snape on the best way to tackle dementors but he did not care slughorns memory wa the most important thing to him now page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tm telling you the stupid prince is not going to be able to help you with this harry said hermione more loudly there is only one way to force someone to do what you want and that is the imperius curse which is illegal yeah i know that thanks said harry not looking up from the book that is why i am looking for something different dumbledore say veritaserum will not do it but there might be something else a potion or a spell you are going about it the wrong way said hermione only you can get the memory dumbledore say that must mean you can persuade slughorn where other people can not it not a question of slipping him a potion anyone could do that how dyou spell belligerent said ron shaking his quill very hard while staring at his parchment it can not be b you m no it is not said hermione pulling ron essay toward her and augury doe not begin o are g either what kind of quill are you using it one of fred and george spellcheck one but i think the charm must be wearing off yes it must said hermione pointing at the title of his essay because we were asked how wed deal with dementors not dugbogs and i do not remember you changing your name to roonil wazlib either ah no said ron staring horrorstruck at the parchment do not say ill have to write the whole thing out again page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling it okay we can fix it said hermione pulling the essay toward her and taking out her wand i love you hermione said ron sinking back in his chair rubbing his eye wearily hermione turned faintly pink but merely said do not let lavender hear you saying that i will not said ron into his hand or maybe i will then she will ditch me why do not you ditch her if you want to finish it asked harry you have not ever chucked anyone have you said ron you and cho just sort of fell apart yeah said harry wish that would happen with me and lavender said ron gloomily watching hermione silently tapping each of his misspelled word with the end of her wand so that they corrected themselves on the page but the more i hint i want to finish it the tighter she hold on it like going out with the giant squid there said hermione some twenty minute later handing back ron essay thanks a million said ron can i borrow your quill for the conclusion harry who had found nothing useful in the half blood prince note so far looked around the three of them were now the only one left in the common room seamus having just gone up to bed cursing snape and his essay the only sound were the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling crackling of the fire and ron scratching out one last paragraph on dementors using hermiones quill harry had just closed the halfblood prince book yawning when crack hermione let out a little shriek ron spilled ink all over his freshly completed essay and harry said kreacher the houseelf bowed low and addressed his own gnarled toe master said he wanted regular report on what the malfoy boy is doing so kreacher ha come to give crack dobby appeared alongside kreacher his teacozy hat askew dobby ha been helping too harry potter he squeaked casting kreacher a resentful look and kreacher ought to tell dobby when he is coming to see harry potter so they can make their report together what is this asked hermione still looking shocked by these sudden appearance what is going on harry harry hesitated before answering because he had not told hermione about setting kreacher and dobby to tail malfoy houseelves were always such a touchy subject with her well they have been following malfoy for me he said page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling night and day croaked kreacher dobby ha not slept for a week harry potter said dobby proudly swaying where he stood hermione looked indignant you have not slept dobby but surely harry you did not tell him not to no of course i did not said harry quickly dobby you can sleep all right but ha either of you found out anything he hastened to ask before hermione could intervene again master malfoy move with a nobility that befits his pure blood croaked kreacher at once his feature recall the fine bone of my mistress and his manner are those of draco malfoy is a bad boy squeaked dobby angrily a bad boy who who he shuddered from the tassel of his tea cozy to the toe of his sock and then ran at the fire a though about to dive into it harry to whom this wa not entirely unexpected caught him around the middle and held him fast for a few second dobby struggled then went limp thank you harry potter he panted dobby still find it difficult to speak ill of his old master harry released him dobby straightened his tea cozy and said defiantly to kreacher but kreacher should know that draco malfoy is not a good master to a houseelf page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yeah we do not need to hear about you being in love with malfoy harry told kreacher let u fast forward to where he actually been going kreacher bowed again looking furious and then said master malfoy eats in the great hall he sleep in a dormitory in the dungeon he attends his class in a variety of dobby you tell me said harry cutting across kreacher ha he been going anywhere he should not have harry potter sir squeaked dobby his great orblike eye shining in the firelight the malfoy boy is breaking no rule that dobby can discover but he is still keen to avoid detection he ha been making regular visit to the seventh floor with a variety of other student who keep watch for him while he enters the room of requirement said harry smacking himself hard on the forehead with advanced potion making hermione and ron stared at him that is where he been sneaking off to that is where he doing whatever he doing and i bet that is why he been disappearing off the map come to think of it i have never seen the room of requirement on there maybe the marauder never knew the room wa there said ron i think it will be part of the magic of the room said hermione if you need it to be unplottable it will be dobby have you managed to get in to have a look at what malfoys doing said harry eagerly page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no harry potter that is impossible said dobby no it not said harry at once malfoy got into our headquarters there last year so ill be able to get in and spy on him no problem but i do not think you will harry said hermione slowly malfoy already knew exactly how we were using the room did not he because that stupid marietta had blabbed he needed the room to become the headquarters of the da so it did but you do not know what the room becomes when malfoy go in there so you do not know what to ask it to transform into there will be a way around that said harry dismissively you have done brilliantly dobby kreachers done well too said hermione kindly but far from looking grateful kreacher averted his huge bloodshot eye and croaked at the ceiling the mudblood is speaking to kreacher kreacher will pretend he can not hear get out of it harry snapped at him and kreacher made one last deep bow and disapparated you would better go and get some sleep too dobby thank you harry potter sir squeaked dobby happily and he too vanished how good this said harry enthusiastically turning to ron and hermione the moment the room wa elffree again we know where malfoys going we have got him cornered now yeah it great said ron glumly who wa attempting to mop up the sodden mass of ink that had recently been an almost completed essay page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hermione pulled it toward her and began siphoning the ink off with her wand but what is all this about him going up there with a variety of student said hermione how many people are in on it you would not think he would trust lot of them to know what he doing yeah that is weird said harry frowning i heard him telling crabbe it wa not crabbes business what he wa doing so what is he telling all these all these harrys voice tailed away he wa staring at the fire god i have been stupid he said quietly it obvious is not it there wa a great vat of it down in the dungeon he could have nicked some any time during that lesson nicked what said ron polyjuice potion he stole some of the polyjuice potion slughorn showed u in our first potion lesson there are not a whole variety of student standing guard for malfoy it just crabbe and goyle a usual yeah it all fit said harry jumping up and starting to pace in front of the fire they are stupid enough to do what they are told even if he will not tell them what he up to but he doe not want them to be seen lurking around outside the room of requirement so he got them taking polyjuice to make them look like other people those two girl i saw him with when he missed quidditch ha crabbe and goyle do you mean to say said hermione in a hushed voice that that little girl whose scale i repaired page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yeah of course said harry loudly staring at her of course malfoy must have been inside the room at the time so she what am i talking about he dropped the scale to tell malfoy not to come out because there wa someone there and there wa that girl who dropped the toadspawn too we have been walking past him all the time and not realizing it he got crabbe and goyle transforming into girl guffawed ron blimey no wonder they do not look too happy these day i am surprised they do not tell him to stuff it well they would not would they if he shown them his dark mark said harry hmmm the dark mark we do not know exists said hermione skeptically rolling up ron dried essay before it could come to any more harm and handing it to him well see said harry confidently yes we will hermione said getting to her foot and stretching but harry before you get all excited i still do not think you will be able to get into the room of requirement without knowing what is there first and i do not think you should forget she heaved her bag onto her shoulder and gave him a very serious look that what you are supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from slughorn good night harry watched her go feeling slightly disgruntled once the door to the girl dormitory had closed behind her he rounded on ron what dyou think page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling wish i could disapparate like a houseelf said ron staring at the spot where dobby had vanished id have that apparition test in the bag harry did not sleep well that night he lay awake for what felt like hour wondering how malfoy wa using the room of requirement and what he harry would see when he went in there the following day for whatever hermione said harry wa sure that if malfoy had been able to see the headquarters of the da he would be able to see malfoy s what could it be a meeting place a hideout a storeroom a workshop harrys mind worked feverishly and his dream when he finally fell asleep were broken and disturbed by image of malfoy who turned into slughorn who turned into snape harry wa in a state of great anticipation over breakfast the following morning he had a free period before defense against the dark art and wa determined to spend it trying to get into the room of requirement hermione wa rather ostentatiously showing no interest in his whispered plan for forcing entry into the room which irritated harry because he thought she might be a lot of help if she wanted to look he said quietly leaning forward and putting a hand on the daily prophet which she had just removed from a post owl to stop her from opening it and vanishing behind it i have not forgotten about slughorn but i have not got a clue how to get that memory off him and until i get a brain wave why should not i find out what malfoys doing i have already told you you need to persuade slughorn said hermione it not a question of tricking him or bewitching him or dumbledore could have done it in a second instead of messing around outside the room of requirement she jerked the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling prophet out from under harrys hand and unfolded it to look at the front page you should go and find slughorn and start appealing to his better nature anyone we know asked ron a hermione scanned the headline yes said hermione causing both harry and ron to gag on their breakfast but it all right he not dead it mundungus he been arrested and sent to azkaban something to do with impersonating an inferius during an attempted burglary and someone called octavius pepper ha vanished oh and how horrible a nineyearold boy ha been arrested for trying to kill his grandparent they think he wa under the imperius curse they finished their breakfast in silence hermione set off immediately for ancient rune ron for the common room where he still had to finish his conclusion on snapes dementor essay and harry for the corridor on the seventh floor and the stretch of wall opposite the tapestry of barnabas the barmy teaching troll to do ballet harry slipped on his invisibility cloak once he had found an empty passage but he need not have bothered when he reached his destination he found it deserted harry wa not sure whether his chance of getting inside the room were better with malfoy inside it or out but at least his first attempt wa not going to be complicated by the presence of crabbe or goyle pretending to be an elevenyearold girl he closed his eye a he approached the place where the room of requirement door wa concealed he knew what he had to do he had become most accomplished at it last year concentrating with all his might he thought i need to see what malfoy s page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling doing in here i need to see what malfoys doing in here i need to see what malfoys doing in here three time he walked past the door then his heart pounding with excitement he opened his eye and faced it but he wa still looking at a stretch of mundanely blank wall he moved forward and gave it an experimental push the stone remained solid and unyielding okay said harry aloud okay i thought the wrong thing he pondered for a moment then set off again eye closed concentrating a hard a he could i need to see the place where malfoy keep coming secretly i need to see the place where malfoy keep coming secretly after three walk past he opened his eye expectantly there wa no door oh come off it he told the wall irritably that wa a clear instruction fine he thought hard for several minute before striding off once more i need you to become the place you become for draco malfoy he did not immediately open his eye when he had finished his patrolling he wa listening hard a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling though he might hear the door pop into existence he heard nothing however except the distant twittering of bird outside he opened his eye there wa still no door harry swore someone screamed he looked around to see a gaggle of first year running back around the corner apparently under the impression that they had just encountered a particularly foulmouthed ghost harry tried every variation of i need to see what draco malfoy is doing inside you that he could think of for a whole hour at the end of which he wa forced to concede that hermione might have had a point the room simply did not want to open for him frustrated and annoyed he set off for defense against the dark art pulling off his invisibility cloak and stuffing it into his bag a he went late again potter said snape coldly a harry hurried into the candlelit classroom ten point from gryffindor harry scowled at snape a he flung himself into the seat beside ron half the class wa still on it foot taking out book and organizing their thing he could not be much later than any of them before we start i want your dementor essay said snape waving his wand carelessly so that twenty five scroll of parchment soared into the air and landed in a neat pile on his desk and i hope for your sake they are better than the tripe i had to endure on resisting the imperius curse now if you will all open your book to page what is it mr finnigan page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling sir said seamus i have been wondering how do you tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost because there wa something in the paper about an inferius no there wa not said snape in a bored voice but sir i heard people talking if you had actually read the article in question mr finnigan you would have known that the socalled inferius wa nothing but a smelly sneak thief by the name of mundungus fletcher i thought snape and mundungus were on the same side muttered harry to ron and hermione should not he be upset mundungus ha been arrest but potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject said snape pointing suddenly at the back of the room his black eye fixed on harry let u ask potter how we would tell the difference between an inferius and a ghost the whole class looked around at harry who hastily tried to recall what dumbledore had told him the night that they had gone to visit slughorn er well ghost are transparent he said oh very good interrupted snape his lip curling yes it is easy to see that nearly six year of magical education have not been wasted on you potter ghost are transparent pansy parkinson let out a highpitched giggle several other people were smirking harry took a deep breath and continued calmly though his inside were page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling boiling yeah ghost are transparent but inferi are dead body are not they so they would be solid a fiveyearold could have told u a much sneered snape the inferius is a corpse that ha been reanimated by a dark wizard spell it is not alive it is merely used like a puppet to do the wizard bidding a ghost a i trust that you are all aware by now is the imprint of a departed soul left upon the earth and of course a potter so wisely tell u transparent well what harry said is the most useful if were trying to tell them apart said ron when we come facetoface with one down a dark alley were going to be having a shufti to see if it solid are not we were not going to be asking excuse me are you the imprint of a departed soul there wa a ripple of laughter instantly quelled by the look snape gave the class another ten point from gryffindor said snape i would expect nothing more sophisticated from you ronald weasley the boy so solid he can not apparate half an inch across a room ivo whispered hermione grabbing harrys arm a he opened his mouth furiously there is no point you will just end up in detention again leave it now open your book to page two hundred and thirteen said snape smirking a little and read the first two paragraph on the cruciatus curse ron wa very subdued all through the class when the bell sounded at the end of the lesson lavender caught up with ron and harry hermione mysteriously melted out of sight a she approached page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and abused snape hotly for his jibe about ron apparition but this seemed to merely irritate ron and he shook her off by making a detour into the boy bathroom with harry snapes right though is not he said ron after staring into a cracked mirror for a minute or two i do not know whether it worth me taking the test i just can not get the hang of apparition you might a well do the extra practice session in hogsmeade and see where they get you said harry reasonably it will be more interesting than trying to get into a stupid hoop anyway then if you are still not you know a good a you would like to be you can postpone the test do it with me over the summ myrtle this is the boy bathroom the ghost of a girl had risen out of the toilet in a cubicle behind them and wa now floating in midair staring at them through thick white round glass oh she said glumly it you two who were you expecting said ron looking at her in the mirror nobody said myrtle picking moodily at a spot on her chin he said he would come back and see me but then you said you would pop in and visit me too she gave harry a reproachful look and i have not seen you for month and month i have learned not to expect too much from boy i thought you lived in that girl bathroom said harry who had been careful to give the place a wide berth for some year now page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i do she said with a sulky little shrug but that doe not mean i can not visit other place i came and saw you in your bath once remember vividly said harry but i thought he liked me she said plaintively maybe if you two left he would come back again we had lot in common i am sure he felt it and she looked hopefully toward the door when you say you had lot in common said ron sounding rather amused now dyou mean he life in an sbend too no said myrtle defiantly her voice echoing loudly around the old tiled bathroom i mean he sensitive people bully him too and he feel lonely and ha not got anybody to talk to and he not afraid to show his feeling and cry there is been a boy in here cry said harry curiously a young boy never you mind said myrtle her small leaky eye fixed on ron who wa now definitely grinning i promised i would not tell anyone and ill take his secret to the not the grave surely said ron with a snort the sewer maybe myrtle gave a howl of rage and dived back into the toilet causing water to slop over the side and onto the floor goading myrtle seemed to have put fresh heart into ron page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you are right he said swinging his schoolbag back over his shoulder ill do the practice session in hogsmeade before i decide about taking the test and so the following weekend ron joined hermione and the rest of the sixth year who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village he missed making trip there and it wa a particularly fine spring day one of the first clear sky they had seen in a long time however he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the room of requirement you would do better said hermione when he confided this plan to ron and her in the entrance hall to go straight to slughorns office and try and get that memory from him i have been trying said harry crossly which wa perfectly true he had lagged behind after every potion lesson that week in an attempt to corner slughorn but the potion master always left the dungeon so fast that harry had not been able to catch him twice harry had gone to his office and knocked but received no reply though on the second occasion he wa sure he had heard the quickly stifled sound of an old gramophone he doe not want to talk to me hermione he can tell i have been trying to get him on his own again and he not going to let it happen well you have just got to keep at it have not you the short queue of people waiting to file past filch who wa doing his usual prodding act with the secrecy sensor moved forward a few step and harry did not answer in case he wa overheard by the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling caretaker he wished ron and hermione both luck then turned and climbed the marble staircase again determined whatever hermione said to devote an hour or two to the room of requirement once out of sight of the entrance hall harry pulled the marauder map and his invisibility cloak from his bag having concealed himself he tapped the map murmured i solemnly swear that i am up to no good and scanned it carefully a it wa sunday morning nearly all the student were inside their various common room the gryffindors in one tower the ravenclaws in another the slytherins in the dungeon and the hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchen here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor there were a few people out in the ground and there alone in the seventhfloor corridor wa gregory goyle there wa no sign of the room of requirement but harry wa not worried about that if goyle wa standing guard outside it the room wa open whether the map wa aware of it or not he therefore sprinted up the stair slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor when he began to creep very slowly toward the very same little girl clutching her heavy brass scale that hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before he waited until he wa right behind her before bending very low and whispering hello you are very pretty are not you goyle gave a highpitched scream of terror threw the scale up into the air and sprinted away vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scale smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor laughing harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which he wa sure draco malfoy wa now standing frozen aware that someone unwelcome wa page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling out there but not daring to make an appearance it gave harry a most agreeable feeling of power a he tried to remember what form of word he had not yet tried yet this hopeful mood did not last long half an hour later having tried many more variation of his request to see what malfoy wa up to the wall wa just a doorless a ever harry felt frustrated beyond belief malfoy might be just foot away from him and there wa still not the tiniest shred of evidence a to what he wa doing in there losing his patience completely harry ran at the wall and kicked it ouch he thought he might have broken his toe a he clutched it and hopped on one foot the invisibility cloak slipped off him harry he spun around onelegged and toppled over there to his utter astonishment wa tonks walking toward him a though she frequently strolled up this corridor what are you doing here he said scrambling to his foot again why did she always have to find him lying on the floor i came to see dumbledore said tonks harry thought she looked terrible thinner than usual her mousecolored hair lank his office is not here said harry it round the other side of the castle behind the gargoyle page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i know said tonks he not there apparently he gone away again ha he said harry putting his bruised foot gingerly back on the floor hey you do not know where he go i suppose no said tonks what did you want to see him about nothing in particular said tonks picking apparently unconsciously at the sleeve of her robe i just thought he might know what is going on i have heard rumor people getting hurt yeah i know it all been in the paper said harry that little kid trying to kill his the prophet often behind the time said tonks who did not seem to be listening to him you have not had any letter from anyone in the order recently no one from the order writes to me anymore said harry not since sirius he saw that her eye had filled with tear i am sorry he muttered awkwardly i mean i miss him a well what said tonks blankly a though she had not heard him well ill see you around harry and she turned abruptly and walked back down the corridor leaving harry to stare after her after a minute or so he pulled the invisibility cloak on again and resumed his effort to get into the room of requirement but his heart wa not in it finally a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hollow feeling in his stomach and the knowledge that ron and hermione would soon be back for lunch made him abandon the attempt and leave the corridor to malfoy who hopefully would be too afraid to leave for some hour to come he found ron and hermione in the great hall already halfway through an early lunch i did it well kind of ron told harry enthusiastically when he caught sight of him i wa supposed to be apparating to outside madam puddifoots tea shop and i overshot it a bit ended up near scrivenshafts but at least i moved good one said harry how did you do hermione oh she wa perfect obviously said ron before hermione could answer perfect deliberation divination and desperation or whatever the hell it is we all went for a quick drink in the three broomstick after and you should have heard twycross going on about her ill be surprised if he doe not pop the question soon and what about you asked hermione ignoring ron have you been up at the room of requirement all this time yep said harry and guess who i ran into up there tonks tonks repeated ron and hermione together looking surprised yeah she said she would come to visit dumbledore if you ask me said ron once harry had finished describing his conversation with tonks she is page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling cracking up a bit losing her nerve after what happened at the ministry it a bit odd said hermione who for some reason looked very concerned she is supposed to be guarding the school why is she suddenly abandoning her post to come and see dumbledore when he not even here i had a thought said harry tentatively he felt strange about voicing it this wa much more hermiones territory than his you do not think she can have been you know in love with sirius hermione stared at him what on earth make you say that i do not know said harry shrugging but she wa nearly cry when i mentioned his name and her patronus is a big fourlegged thing now i wondered whether it had not become you know him it a thought said hermione slowly but i still do not know why she would be bursting into the castle to see dumbledore if that is really why she wa here go back to what i said doe not it said ron who wa now shoveling mashed potato into his mouth she is gone a bit funny lost her nerve woman he said wisely to harry they are easily upset and yet said hermione coming out of her reverie i doubt you would find a woman who sulked for half an hour because madam rosmerta did not laugh at their joke about the hag the healer and the mimbulus mimbletonia ron scowled page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling after the burial patch of bright blue sky were beginning to appear over the castle turret but these sign of approaching summer did not lift harrys mood he had been thwarted both in his attempt to find out what malfoy wa doing and in his effort to start a conversation with slughorn that might lead somehow to slughorn handing over the memory he had apparently suppressed for decade for the last time just forget about malfoy hermione told harry firmly they were sitting with ron in a sunny corner of the courtyard after lunch hermione and ron were both clutching a ministry of magic leaflet common apparition mistake and how to avoid them for they were taking their test that very afternoon but by and large the leaflet had not proved soothing to the nerve page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron gave a start and tried to hide behind hermione a a girl came around the corner it is not lavender said hermione wearily oh good said ron relaxing harry potter said the girl i wa asked to give you this thanks harrys heart sank a he took the small scroll of parchment once the girl wa out of earshot he said dumbledore said we would not be having any more lesson until i got the memory maybe he want to check on how you are doing suggested hermione a harry unrolled the parchment but rather than finding dumbledore s long narrow slanted writing he saw an untidy sprawl very difficult to read due to the presence of large blotch on the parchment where the ink had run dear harry ron and hermione aragog died last night harry and ron you met him and you know how special he wa hermione i know you would have liked him it would mean a lot to me if you would nip down for the burial later this evening i am planning on doing it round dusk that wa his favorite time of day i know you are not supposed to be out that late but you can use the cloak would not ask but i can not face it alone hagrid page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling look at this said harry handing the note to hermione oh for heaven sake she said scanning it quickly and passing it to ron who read it through looking increasingly incredulous he mentaft he said furiously that thing told it mate to eat harry and me told them to help themselves and now hagrid expects u to go down there and cry over it horrible hairy body it not just that said hermione he asking u to leave the castle at night and he know security a million time tighter and how much trouble wed be in if we were caught we have been down to see him by night before said harry yes but for something like this said hermione we have risked a lot to help hagrid out but after all aragogs dead if it were a question of saving him id want to go even le said ron firmly you did not meet him hermione believe me being dead will have improved him a lot harry took the note back and stared down at all the inky blotch all over it tear had clearly fallen thick and fast upon the parchment harry you can not be thinking of going said hermione it such a pointless thing to get detention for harry sighed yeah i know he said i spose hagrid ll have to bury aragog without u page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yes he will said hermione looking relieved look potion will be almost empty this afternoon with u all off doing our test try and soften slughorn up a bit then fiftyseventh time lucky you think said harry bitterly lucky said ron suddenly harry that is it get lucky what dyou mean use your lucky potion ron that is that is it said hermione sounding stunned of course why did not i think of it harry stared at them both felix felicis he said i do not know i wa sort of saving it what for demanded ron incredulously what on earth is more important than this memory harry asked hermione harry did not answer the thought of that little golden bottle had hovered on the edge of his imagination for some time vague and unformulated plan that involved ginny splitting up with dean and ron somehow being happy to see her with a new boyfriend had been fermenting in the depth of his brain unacknowledged except during dream or the twilight time between sleeping and waking harry are you still with u asked hermione wha yeah of course he said pulling himself together well okay if i can not get slughorn to talk page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling this afternoon ill take some felix and have another go this evening that is decided then said hermione briskly getting to her foot and performing a graceful pirouette destination determination deliberation she murmured oh stop that ron begged her i feel sick enough a it is quick hide me it is not lavender said hermione impatiently a another couple of girl appeared in the courtyard and ron dived behind her cool said ron peering over hermiones shoulder to check blimey they do not look happy do they they are the montgomery sister and of course they do not look happy did not you hear what happened to their little brother said hermione i am losing track of what is happening to everyone is relative to be honest said ron well their brother wa attacked by a werewolf the rumor is that their mother refused to help the death eater anyway the boy wa only five and he died in st mungos they could not save him he died repeated harry shocked but surely werewolf do not kill they just turn you into one of them they sometimes kill said ron who looked unusually grave now i have heard of it happening when the werewolf get carried away what wa the werewolf name said harry quickly page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well the rumor is that it wa that fenrir greyback said hermione i knew it the maniac who like attacking kid the one lupin told me about said harry angrily hermione looked at him bleakly harry you have got to get that memory she said it all about stopping voldemort is not it these dreadful thing that are happening are all down to him the bell rang overhead in the castle and both hermione and ron jumped to their foot looking terrified you will do fine harry told them both a they headed toward the entrance hall to meet the rest of the people taking their apparition test good luck and you too said hermione with a significant look a harry headed off to the dungeon there were only three of them in potion that afternoon harry ernie and draco malfoy all too young to apparate just yet said slughorn genially not turned seventeen yet they shook their head ah well said slughorn cheerily a were so few well do something fun i want you all to brew me up something amusing that sound good sir said ernie sycophantically rubbing his hand together malfoy on the other hand did not crack a smile page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what do you mean something amusing he said irritably oh surprise me said slughorn airily malfoy opened his copy of advanced potionmaking with a sulky expression it could not have been plainer that he thought this lesson wa a waste of time undoubtedly harry thought watching him over the top of his own book malfoy wa begrudging the time he could otherwise be spending in the room of requirement wa it his imagination or did malfoy like tonks look thinner certainly he looked paler his skin still had that grayish tinge probably because he so rarely saw daylight these day but there wa no air of smugness excitement or superiority none of the swagger that he had had on the hogwarts express when he had boasted openly of the mission he had been given by voldemort there could be only one conclusion in harrys opinion the mission whatever it wa wa going badly cheered by this thought harry skimmed through his copy of advanced potionmaking and found a heavily corrected halfblood prince version of an elixir to induce euphoria which seemed not only to meet slughorn s instruction but which might harrys heart leapt a the thought struck him put slughorn into such a good mood that he would be prepared to hand over that memory if harry could persuade him to taste some well now this look absolutely wonderful said slughorn an hour and a half later clapping his hand together a he stared down into the sunshine yellow content of harrys cauldron euphoria i take it and what is that i smell mmmm you have added just a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling sprig of peppermint have not you unorthodox but what a stroke of inspiration harry of course that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effect of excessive singing and nosetweaking i really do not know where you get these brain wave my boy unless harry pushed the halfblood prince book deeper into his bag with his foot it just your mother gene coming out in you oh yeah maybe said harry relieved ernie wa looking rather grumpy determined to outshine harry for once he had most rashly invented his own potion which had curdled and formed a kind of purple dumpling at the bottom of his cauldron malfoy wa already packing up sourfaced slughorn had pronounced his hiccuping solution merely passable the bell rang and both ernie and malfoy left at once sir harry began but slughorn immediately glanced over his shoulder when he saw that the room wa empty but for himself and harry he hurried away a fast a he could professor professor do not you want to taste my po called harry desperately but slughorn had gone disappointed harry emptied the cauldron packed up his thing left the dungeon and walked slowly back upstairs to the common room ron and hermione returned in the late afternoon page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry cried hermione a she climbed through the portrait hole harry i passed well done he said and ron he he just failed whispered hermione a ron came slouching into the room looking most morose it wa really unlucky a tiny thing the examiner just spotted that he would left half an eyebrow behind how did it go with slughorn no joy said harry a ron joined them bad luck mate but you will pas next time we can take it together yeah i spose said ron grumpily but half an eyebrow like that matter i know said hermione soothingly it doe seem really harsh they spent most of their dinner roundly abusing the apparition examiner and ron looked fractionally more cheerful by the time they set off back to the common room now discussing the continuing problem of slughorn and the memory so harry you going to use the felix felicis or what ron demanded yeah i spose id better said harry i do not reckon ill need all of it not twelve hour worth it can not take all night ill just take a mouthful two or three hour should do it it a great feeling when you take it said ron reminiscently like you can not do anything wrong page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what are you talking about said hermione laughing you have never taken any yeah but i thought i had did not i said ron a though explaining the obvious same difference really a they had only just seen slughorn enter the great hall and knew that he liked to take time over meal they lingered for a while in the common room the plan being that harry should go to slughorn s office once the teacher had had time to get back there when the sun had sunk to the level of the treetop in the forbidden forest they decided the moment had come and after checking carefully that neville dean and seamus were all in the common room sneaked up to the boy dormitory harry took out the rolledup sock at the bottom of his trunk and extracted the tiny gleaming bottle well here go said harry and he raised the little bottle and took a carefully measured gulp what doe it feel like whispered hermione harry did not answer for a moment then slowly but surely an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him he felt a though he could have done anything anything at all and getting the memory from slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible but positively easy he got to his foot smiling brimming with confidence excellent he said really excellent right i am going down to hagrids page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what said ron and hermione together looking aghast no harry you have got to go and see slughorn remember said hermione no said harry confidently i am going to hagrids i have got a good feeling about going to hagrids you have got a good feeling about burying a giant spider asked ron looking stunned yeah said harry pulling his invisibility cloak out of his bag i feel like it the place to be tonight you know what i mean no said ron and hermione together both looking positively alarmed now this is felix felicis i suppose said hermione anxiously holding up the bottle to the light you have not got another little bottle full of i do not know essence of insanity suggested ron a harry swung his cloak over his shoulder harry laughed and ron and hermione looked even more alarmed trust me he said i know what i am doing or at least he strolled confidently to the door felix doe he pulled the invisibility cloak over his head and set off down the stair ron and hermione hurrying along behind him at the foot of the stair harry slid through the open door page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what were you doing up there with her shrieked lavender brown staring right through harry at ron and hermione emerging together from the boy dormitory harry heard ron spluttering behind him a he darted across the room away from them getting through the portrait hole wa simple a he approached it ginny and dean came through it and harry wa able to slip between them a he did so he brushed accidentally against ginny do not push me please dean she said sounding annoyed you are always doing that i can get through perfectly well on my own the portrait swung closed behind harry but not before he had heard dean make an angry retort his feeling of elation increasing harry strode off through the castle he did not have to creep along for he met nobody on his way but this did not surprise him in the slightest this evening he wa the luckiest person at hogwarts why he knew that going to hagrids wa the right thing to do he had no idea it wa a though the potion wa illuminating a few step of the path at a time he could not see the final destination he could not see where slughorn came in but he knew that he wa going the right way to get that memory when he reached the entrance hall he saw that filch had forgotten to lock the front door beaming harry threw it open and breathed in the smell of clean air and grass for a moment before walking down the step into the dusk it wa when he reached the bottom step that it occurred to him how very pleasant it would be to pas the vegetable patch on his walk to hagrids it wa not strictly on the way but it seemed clear to harry that page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling this wa a whim on which he should act so he directed his foot immediately toward the vegetable patch where he wa pleased but not altogether surprised to find professor slughorn in conversation with professor sprout harry lurked behind a low stone wall feeling at peace with the world and listening to their conversation i do thank you for taking the time pomona slughorn wa saying courteously most authority agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight oh i quite agree said professor sprout warmly that enough for you plenty plenty said slughorn who harry saw wa carrying an armful of leafy plant this should allow for a few leaf for each of my third year and some to spare if anybody overstews them well good evening to you and many thanks again professor sprout headed off into the gathering darkness in the direction of her greenhouse and slughorn directed his step to the spot where harry stood invisible seized with an immediate desire to reveal himself harry pulled off the cloak with a flourish good evening professor merlin beard harry you made me jump said slughorn stopping dead in his track and looking wary how did you get out of the castle i think filch must have forgotten to lock the door said harry cheerfully and wa delighted to see slughorn scowl page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ill be reporting that man he more concerned about litter than proper security if you ask me but why are you out here harry well sir it hagrid said harry who knew that the right thing to do just now wa to tell the truth he pretty upset but you will not tell anyone professor i do not want trouble for him slughorns curiosity wa evidently aroused well i can not promise that he said gruffly but i know that dumbledore trust hagrid to the hilt so i am sure he can not be up to anything very dreadful well it this giant spider he had it for year it lived in the forest it could talk and everything i heard rumor there were acromantulas in the forest said slughorn softly looking over at the mass of black tree it true then yes said harry but this one aragog the first one hagrid ever got it died last night he devastated he want company while he buries it and i said id go touching touching said slughorn absentmindedly his large droopy eye fixed upon the distant light of hagrid s cabin but acromantula venom is very valuable if the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out of course i would not want to do anything insensitive if hagrid is upset but if there wa any way to procure some i mean it almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it alive slughorn seemed to be talking more to himself than harry now page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling seems an awful waste not to collect it might get a hundred galleon a pint to be frank my salary is not large and now harry saw clearly what wa to be done well he said with a most convincing hesitancy well if you wanted to come professor hagrid would probably be really pleased give aragog a better sendoff you know yes of course said slughorn his eye now gleaming with enthusiasm i tell you what harry ill meet you down there with a bottle or two well drink the poor beast well not health but well send it off in style anyway once it buried and ill change my tie this one is a little exuberant for the occasion he bustled back into the castle and harry sped off to hagrid s delighted with himself yeh came croaked hagrid when he opened the door and saw harry emerging from the invisibility cloak in front of him yeah ron and hermione could not though said harry they are really sorry don don matter he would have bin touched yehre here though harry hagrid gave a great sob he had made himself a black armband out of what looked like a rag dipped in boot polish and his eye were puffy red and swollen harry patted him consolingly on the elbow which wa the highest point of hagrid he could easily reach where are we burying him he asked the forest page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling blimey no said hagrid wiping his streaming eye on the bottom of his shirt the other spider won let me anywhere near their web now aragogs gone turn out it wa ony on his order they didn eat me can yeh believe that harry the honest answer wa yes harry recalled with painful ease the scene when he and ron had come facetoface with the acromantulas they had been quite clear that aragog wa the only thing that stopped them from eating hagrid never bin an area o the forest i couldn go before said hagrid shaking his head it wasn easy gettin aragogs body out o there i can tell yeh they usually eat their dead see but i wanted ter give i am a nice burial a proper sendoff he broke into sob again and harry resumed the patting of his elbow saying a he did so for the potion seemed to indicate that it wa the right thing to do professor slughorn met me coming down here hagrid not in trouble are yeh said hagrid looking up alarmed yeh shouldn be outta the castle in the evenin i know it it my fault no no when he heard what i wa doing he said he would like to come and pay his last respect to aragog too said harry he gone to change into something more suitable i think and he said he would bring some bottle so we can drink to aragogs memory did he said hagrid looking both astonished and touched thas thas righ nice of him that is an not turnin yeh in either i have never really had a lot ter do with horace slughorn before cornin ter see old page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling aragog off though eh well he dve liked that aragog would harry thought privately that what aragog would have liked most about slughorn wa the ample amount of edible flesh he provided but he merely moved to the rear window of hagrid s hut where he saw the rather horrible sight of the enormous dead spider lying on it back outside it leg curled and tangled are we going to bury him here hagrid in your garden jus beyond the pumpkin patch i thought said hagrid in a choked voice i have already dug the yeh know grave jus thought wed say a few nice thing over him happy memory yeh know his voice quivered and broke there wa a knock on the door and he turned to answer it blowing his nose on his great spotted handkerchief a he did so slughorn hurried over the threshold several bottle in his arm and wearing a somber black cravat hagrid he said in a deep grave voice so very sorry to hear of your loss thas very nice of yeh said hagrid thanks a lot an thanks fer not givin harry detention neither would not have dreamed of it said slughorn sad night sad night where is the poor creature out here said hagrid in a shaking voice shall we shall we do it then the three of them stepped out into the back garden the moon wa glistening palely through the tree now and it ray mingled with the light spilling from page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hagrids window to illuminate aragogs body lying on the edge of a massive pit beside a tenfoothigh mound of freshly dug earth magnificent said slughorn approaching the spider head where eight milky eye stared blankly at the sky and two huge curved pincer shone motionless in the moonlight harry thought he heard the tinkle of bottle a slughorn bent over the pincer apparently examining the enormous hairy head it not evryone appreciates how beauiful they are said hagrid to slughorn s back tear leaking from the corner of his crinkled eye i didn know yeh were intrested in creature like aragog horace interested my dear hagrid i revere them said slughorn stepping back from the body harry saw the glint of a bottle disappear beneath his cloak though hagrid mopping his eye once more noticed nothing now shall we proceed to the burial hagrid nodded and moved forward he heaved the gigantic spider into his arm and with an enormous grunt rolled it into the dark pit it hit the bottom with a rather horrible crunchy thud hagrid started to cry again of course it difficult for you who knew him best said slughorn who like harry could reach no higher than hagrids elbow but patted it all the same why do not i say a few word he must have got a lot of good quality venom from aragog harry thought for slughorn wore a satisfied smirk a he stepped up to the rim of the pit and said in a slow impressive voice farewell aragog king of arachnid whose long and faithful friendship those page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling who knew you will not forget though your body will decay your spirit lingers on in the quiet webspun place of your forest home may your manyeyed descendant ever flourish and your human friend find solace for the loss they have sustained tha wa tha wa beauiful howled hagrid and he collapsed onto the compost heap cry harder than ever there there said slughorn waving his wand so that the huge pile of earth rose up and then fell with a muffled sort of crash onto the dead spider forming a smooth mound let u get inside and have a drink get on his other side harry that is it up you come hagrid well done they deposited hagrid in a chair at the table fang who had been skulking in his basket during the burial now came padding softly across to them and put his heavy head into harrys lap a usual slughorn uncorked one of the bottle of wine he had brought i have had it all tested for poison he assured harry pouring most of the first bottle into one of hagrid s bucket sized mug and handing it to hagrid had a houseelf taste every bottle after what happened to your poor friend rupert harry saw in his mind eye the expression on hermiones face if she ever heard about this abuse of houseelves and decided never to mention it to her one for harry said slughorn dividing a second bottle between two mug and one for me well he raised his mug high to aragog aragog said harry and hagrid together page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling both slughorn and hagrid drank deeply harry however with the way ahead illuminated for him by felix felicis knew that he must not drink so he merely pretended to take a gulp and then set the mug back on the table before him i had him from an egg yeh know said hagrid morosely tiny little thing he wa when he hatched bout the size of a pekinese sweet said slughorn used ter keep him in a cupboard up at the school until well hagrid s face darkened and harry knew why tom riddle had contrived to have hagrid thrown out of school blamed for opening the chamber of secret slughorn however did not seem to be listening he wa looking up at the ceiling from which a number of brass pot hung and also a long silky skein of bright white hair that is never unicorn hair hagrid oh yeah said hagrid indifferently get pulled out of their tail they catch it on branch an stuff in the forest yeh know but my dear chap do you know how much that is worth i use it fer bindin on bandage an stuff if a creature get injured said hagrid shrugging it dead useful very strong see slughorn took another deep draught from his mug his eye moving carefully around the cabin now looking harry knew for more treasure that he might page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling be able to convert into a plentiful supply of oak matured mead crystalized pineapple and velvet smoking jacket he refilled hagrids mug and his own and questioned him about the creature that lived in the forest these day and how hagrid wa able to look after them all hagrid becoming expansive under the influence of the drink and slughorn s flattering interest stopped mopping his eye and entered happily into a long explanation of bowtruckle husbandry the felix felicis gave harry a little nudge at this point and he noticed that the supply of drink that slughorn had brought wa running out fast harry had not yet managed to bring off the refilling charm without saying the incantation aloud but the idea that he might not be able to do it tonight wa laughable indeed harry grinned to himself a unnoticed by either hagrid or slughorn now swapping tale of the illegal trade in dragon egg he pointed his wand under the table at the emptying bottle and they immediately began to refill after an hour or so hagrid and slughorn began making extravagant toast to hogwarts to dumbledore to elfmade wine and to harry potter bellowed hagrid slopping some of his fourteenth bucket of wine down his chin a he drained it yes indeed cried slughorn a little thickly parry otter the chosen boy who well something of that sort he mumbled and drained his mug too not long after this hagrid became tearful again and pressed the whole unicorn tail upon slughorn who pocketed it with cry of to friendship to generosity to ten galleon a hair page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and for a while after that hagrid and slughorn were sitting side by side arm around each other singing a slow sad song about a dying wizard called odo aaargh the good die young muttered hagrid slumping low onto the table a little crosseyed while slughorn continued to warble the refrain me dad wa no age ter go nor were yer mum an dad harry great fat tear oozed out of the corner of hagrid s crinkled eye again he grasped harrys arm and shook it be wiz and witchard o their age i never knew terrible thing terrible thing and odo the hero they bore him back home to the place that he would known a a lad sang slughorn plaintively they laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two which wa sad terrible hagrid grunted and his great shaggy head rolled sideways onto his arm and he fell asleep snoring deeply sorry said slughorn with a hiccup can not carry a tune to save my life hagrid wa not talking about your singing said harry quietly he wa talking about my mum and dad dying oh said slughorn repressing a large belch oh dear yes that wa wa terrible indeed terrible terrible page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he looked quite at a loss for what to say and resorted to refilling their mug i do not do not suppose you remember it harry he asked awkwardly no well i wa only one when they died said harry his eye on the flame of the candle flickering in hagrids heavy snore but i have found out pretty much what happened since my dad died first did you know that i i did not said slughorn in a hushed voice yeah voldemort murdered him and then stepped over his body toward my mum said harry slughorn gave a great shudder but he did not seem able to tear his horrified gaze away from harrys face he told her to get out of the way said harry remorselessly he told me she need not have died he only wanted me she could have run oh dear breathed slughorn she could have she need not that is awful it is is not it said harry in a voice barely more than a whisper but she did not move dad wa already dead but she did not want me to go too she tried to plead with voldemort but he just laughed that is enough said slughorn suddenly raising a shaking hand really my dear boy enough i am an old man i do not need to hear i do not want to hear i forgot lied harry felix felicis leading him on you liked her did not you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling liked her said slughorn his eye brimming with tear once more i do not imagine anyone who met her would not have liked her very brave very funny it wa the most horrible thing but you will not help her son said harry she gave me her life but you will not give me a memory hagrids rumbling snore filled the cabin harry looked steadily into slughorn s tearfilled eye the potion master seemed unable to look away do not say that he whispered it is not a question if it were to help you of course but no purpose can be served it can said harry clearly dumbledore need information i need information he knew he wa safe felix wa telling him that slughorn would remember nothing of this in the morning looking slughorn straight in the eye harry leaned forward a little i am the chosen one i have to kill him i need that memory slughorn turned paler than ever his shiny forehead gleamed with sweat you are the chosen one of course i am said harry calmly but then my dear boy you are asking a great deal you are asking me in fact to aid you in your attempt to destroy page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you do not want to get rid of the wizard who killed lily evans harry harry of course i do but you are scared hell find out you helped me slughorn said nothing he looked terrified be brave like my mother professor slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking finger to his mouth he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby i am not proud he whispered through his finger i am ashamed of what of what that memory show i think i may have done great damage that day you would cancel out anything you did by giving me the memory said harry it would be a very brave and noble thing to do hagrid twitched in his sleep and snored on slughorn and harry stared at each other over the guttering candle there wa a long long silence but felix felicis told harry not to break it to wait then very slowly slughorn put his hand in his pocket and pulled out his wand he put his other hand inside his cloak and took out a small empty bottle still looking into harrys eye slughorn touched the tip of his wand to his temple and withdrew it so that a long silver thread of memory came away too clinging to the wand tip longer and longer the memory stretched until it broke and swung silvery bright from the wand slughorn lowered it into the bottle where it coiled then spread page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling swirling like gas he corked the bottle with a trembling hand and then passed it across the table to harry thank you very much professor you are a good boy said professor slughorn tear trickling down his fat cheek into his walrus mustache and you have got her eye just do not think too badly of me once you have seen it and he too put his head on his arm gave a deep sigh and fell asleep page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling horcruxes harry could feel the felix felicis wearing off a he crept back into the castle the front door had remained unlocked for him but on the third floor he met peeve and only narrowly avoided detection by diving sideways through one of his shortcut by the time he got up to the portrait of the fat lady and pulled off his invisibility cloak he wa not surprised to find her in a most unhelpful mood what sort of time do you call this i am really sorry i had to go out for something important well the password changed at midnight so you will just have to sleep in the corridor will not you you are joking said harry why did it have to change at midnight page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling that is the way it is said the fat lady if you are angry go and take it up with the headmaster he the one who is tightened security fantastic said harry bitterly looking around at the hard floor really brilliant yeah i would go and take it up with dumbledore if he wa here because he the one who wanted me to he is here said a voice behind harry professor dumbledore returned to the school an hour ago nearly headless nick wa gliding toward harry his head wobbling a usual upon his ruff i had it from the bloody baron who saw him arrive said nick he appeared according to the baron to be in good spirit though a little tired of course where is he said harry his heart leaping oh groaning and clanking up on the astronomy tower it a favorite pastime of his not the bloody baron dumbledore oh in his office said nick i believe from what the baron said that he had business to attend to before turning in yeah he ha said harry excitement blazing in his chest at the prospect of telling dumbledore he had secured the memory he wheeled about and sprinted off again ignoring the fat lady who wa calling after him come back all right i lied i wa annoyed you woke me up the password still tapeworm page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but harry wa already hurtling back along the corridor and within minute he wa saying toffee eclair to dumbledores gargoyle which leapt aside permitting harry entrance onto the spiral staircase enter said dumbledore when harry knocked he sounded exhausted harry pushed open the door there wa dumbledores office looking the same a ever but with black star strewn sky beyond the window good gracious harry said dumbledore in surprise to what do i owe this very late pleasure sir i have got it i have got the memory from slughorn harry pulled out the tiny glass bottle and showed it to dumbledore for a moment or two the headmaster looked stunned then his face split in a wide smile harry this is spectacular news very well done indeed i knew you could do it all thought of the lateness of the hour apparently forgotten he hurried around his desk took the bottle with slughorns memory in his uninjured hand and strode over to the cabinet where he kept the pensieve and now said dumbledore placing the stone basin upon his desk and emptying the content of the bottle into it now at last we shall see harry quickly harry bowed obediently over the pensieve and felt his foot leave the office floor once again he fell through darkness and landed in horace slughorns office many year before page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there wa the much younger slughorn with his thick shiny strawcolored hair and his gingeryblond mustache sitting again in the comfortable winged armchair in his office his foot resting upon a velvet pouffe a small glass of wine in one hand the other rummaging in a box of crystalized pineapple and there were the halfdozen teenage boy sitting around slughorn with tom riddle in the midst of them marvolos goldandblack ring gleaming on his finger dumbledore landed beside harry just a riddle asked sir is it true that professor merrythought is retiring tom tom if i knew i could not tell you said slughorn wagging his finger reprovingly at riddle though winking at the same time i must say id like to know where you get your information boy more knowledgeable than half the staff you are riddle smiled the other boy laughed and cast him admiring look what with your uncanny ability to know thing you should not and your careful flattery of the people who matter thank you for the pineapple by the way you are quite right it is my favorite several of the boy tittered again i confidently expect you to rise to minister of magic within twenty year fifteen if you keep sending me pineapple i have excellent contact at the ministry tom riddle merely smiled a the others laughed again harry noticed that he wa by no mean the eldest of the group of boy but that they all seemed to look to him a their leader page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i do not know that politics would suit me sir he said when the laughter had died away i do not have the right kind of background for one thing a couple of the boy around him smirked at each other harry wa sure they were enjoying a private joke undoubtedly about what they knew or suspected regarding their gang leader famous ancestor nonsense said slughorn briskly could not be plainer you come from decent wizarding stock ability like yours no you will go far tom i have never been wrong about a student yet the small golden clock standing upon slughorn s desk chimed eleven of the clock behind him and he looked around good gracious is it that time already you would better get going boy or well all be in trouble lestrange i want your essay by tomorrow or it detention same go for you avery one by one the boy filed out of the room slughorn heaved himself out of his armchair and carried his empty glass over to his desk a movement behind him made him look around riddle wa still standing there look sharp tom you do not want to be caught out of bed out of hour and you a prefect sir i wanted to ask you something ask away then mboy ask away sir i wondered what you know about about horcruxes page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling slughorn stared at him his thick finger absentmindedly caressing the stem of his wine glass project for defense against the dark art is it but harry could tell that slughorn knew perfectly well that this wa not schoolwork not exactly sir said riddle i came across the term while reading and i did not fully understand it no well you would be hardpushed to find a book at hogwarts that will give you detail on horcruxes tom that is very dark stuff very dark indeed said slughorn but you obviously know all about them sir i mean a wizard like you sorry i mean if you can not tell me obviously i just knew if anyone could tell me you could so i just thought id ask it wa very well done thought harry the hesitancy the casual tone the careful flattery none of it overdone he harry had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work he could tell that riddle wanted the information very very much perhaps had been working toward this moment for week well said slughorn not looking at riddle but fiddling with the ribbon on top of his box of crystalized pineapple well it can not hurt to give you an overview of course just so that you understand the term a horcrux is the word used for an object in which a person ha concealed part of their soul i do not quite understand how that work though sir said riddle page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling his voice wa carefully controlled but harry could sense his excitement well you split your soul you see said slughorn and hide part of it in an object outside the body then even if one body is attacked or destroyed one can not die for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged but of course existence in such a form slughorn s face crumpled and harry found himself remembering word he had heard nearly two year before i wa ripped from my body i wa le than spirit le than the meanest ghost but still i wa alive few would want it tom very few death would be preferable but riddle hunger wa now apparent his expression wa greedy he could no longer hide his longing how do you split your soul well said slughorn uncomfortably you must understand that the soul is supposed to remain intact and whole splitting it is an act of violation it is against nature but how do you do it by an act of evil the supreme act of evil by committing murder killing rip the soul apart the wizard intent upon creating a horcrux would use the damage to his advantage he would encase the torn portion encase but how page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there is a spell do not ask me i do not know said slughorn shaking his head like an old elephant bothered by mosquito do i look a though i have tried it do i look like a killer no sir of course not said riddle quickly i am sorry i did not mean to offend not at all not at all not offended said slughorn gruffly it natural to feel some curiosity about these thing wizard of a certain caliber have always been drawn to that aspect of magic yes sir said riddle what i do not understand though just out of curiosity i mean would one horcrux be much use can you only split your soul once would not it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more piece i mean for instance is not seven the most powerfully magical number would not seven merlin beard tom yelped slughorn seven is not it bad enough to think of killing one person and in any case bad enough to divide the soul but to rip it into seven piece slughorn looked deeply troubled now he wa gazing at riddle a though he had never seen him plainly before and harry could tell that he wa regretting entering into the conversation at all of course he muttered this is all hypothetical what were discussing is not it all academic yes sir of course said riddle quickly but all the same tom keep it quiet what i have told that is to say what we have discussed people would not like to think we have been chatting about page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling horcruxes it a banned subject at hogwarts you know dumbledores particularly fierce about it i will not say a word sir said riddle and he left but not before harry had glimpsed his face which wa full of that same wild happiness it had worn when he had first found out that he wa a wizard the sort of happiness that did not enhance his handsome feature but made them somehow le human thank you harry said dumbledore quietly let u go when harry landed back on the office floor dumbledore wa already sitting down behind his desk harry sat too and waited for dumbledore to speak i have been hoping for this piece of evidence for a very long time said dumbledore at last it confirms the theory on which i have been working it tell me that i am right and also how very far there is still to go harry suddenly noticed that every single one of the old headmaster and headmistress in the portrait around the wall wa awake and listening in on their conversation a corpulent rednosed wizard had actually taken out an ear trumpet well harry said dumbledore i am sure you understood the significance of what we just heard at the same age a you are now give or take a few month tom riddle wa doing all he could to find out how to make himself immortal you think he succeeded then sir asked harry he made a horcrux and that is why he did not die when page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he attacked me he had a horcrux hidden somewhere a bit of his soul wa safe a bit or more said dumbledore you heard voldemort what he particularly wanted from horace wa an opinion on what would happen to the wizard who created more than one horcrux what would happen to the wizard so determined to evade death that he would be prepared to murder many time rip his soul repeatedly so a to store it in many separately concealed horcruxes no book would have given him that information a far a i know a far i am sure a voldemort knew no wizard had ever done more than tear his soul in two dumbledore paused for a moment marshaling his thought and then said four year ago i received what i considered certain proof that voldemort had split his soul where asked harry how you handed it to me harry said dumbledore the diary riddle diary the one giving instruction on how to reopen the chamber of secret i do not understand sir said harry well although i did not see the riddle who came out of the diary what you described to me wa a phenomenon i had never witnessed a mere memory starting to act and think for itself a mere memory sapping the life out of the girl into whose hand it had fallen no something much more sinister had lived inside that book a fragment of soul i wa almost sure of it the diary had been a horcrux but this raised a many question a it answered page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling what intrigued and alarmed me most wa that that diary had been intended a a weapon a much a a safeguard i still do not understand said harry well it worked a a horcrux is supposed to work in other word the fragment of soul concealed inside it wa kept safe and had undoubtedly played it part in preventing the death of it owner but there could be no doubt that riddle really wanted that diary read wanted the piece of his soul to inhabit or posse somebody else so that slytherins monster would be unleashed again well he did not want his hard work to be wasted said harry he wanted people to know he wa slytherins heir because he could not take credit at the time quite correct said dumbledore nodding but do not you see harry that if he intended the diary to be passed to or planted on some future hogwarts student he wa being remarkably blase about that precious fragment of his soul concealed within it the point of a horcrux is a professor slughorn explained to keep part of the self hidden and safe not to fling it into somebody el path and run the risk that they might destroy it a indeed happened that particular fragment of soul is no more you saw to that the careless way in which voldemort regarded this horcrux seemed most ominous to me it suggested that he must have made or been planning to make more horcruxes so that the loss of his first would not be so detrimental i did not wish to believe it but nothing else seemed to make sense page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling then you told me two year later that on the night that voldemort returned to his body he made a most illuminating and alarming statement to his death eater who have gone further than anybody along the path that lead to immortality that wa what you told me he said further than anybody and i thought i knew what that meant though the death eater did not he wa referring to his horcruxes horcruxes in the plural harry which i do not believe any other wizard ha ever had yet it fitted lord voldemort ha seemed to grow le human with the passing year and the transformation he ha undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul wa mutilated beyond the realm of what we might call usual evil so he made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people said harry why could not he make a sorcerer stone or steal one if he wa so interested in immortality well we know that he tried to do just that five year ago said dumbledore but there are several reason why i think a sorcerer stone would appeal le than horcruxes to lord voldemort while the elixir of life doe indeed extend life it must be drunk regularly for all eternity if the drinker is to maintain their immortality therefore voldemort would be entirely dependent on the elixir and if it ran out or wa contaminated or if the stone wa stolen he would die just like any other man voldemort like to operate alone remember i believe that he would have found the thought of being dependent even on the elixir intolerable of course he wa prepared to drink it if it would take him out of the horrible partlife to which he wa condemned after attacking you but only to regain a body thereafter i am convinced he intended to continue to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling rely on his horcruxes he would need nothing more if only he could regain a human form he wa already immortal you see or a close to immortal a any man can be but now harry armed with this information the crucial memory you have succeeded in procuring for u we are closer to the secret of finishing lord voldemort than anyone ha ever been before you heard him harry would not it be better make you stronger to have your soul in more piece is not seven the most powerfully magical number is not seven the most powerfully magical number yes i think the idea of a sevenpart soul would greatly appeal to lord voldemort he made seven horcruxes said harry horror struck while several of the portrait on the wall made similar noise of shock and outrage but they could be anywhere in the world hidden buried or invisible i am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem said dumbledore calmly but firstly no harry not seven horcruxes six the seventh part of his soul however maimed resides inside his regenerated body that wa the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many year during his exile without that he ha no self at all that seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill voldemort must attack the piece that life in his body but the six horcruxes then said harry a little desperately how are we supposed to find them you are forgetting you have already destroyed one of them and i have destroyed another page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you have said harry eagerly yes indeed said dumbledore and he raised his blackened burnedlooking hand the ring harry marvolos ring and a terrible curse there wa upon it too had it not been forgive me the lack of seemly modesty for my own prodigious skill and for professor snapes timely action when i returned to hogwarts desperately injured i might not have lived to tell the tale however a withered hand doe not seem an unreasonable exchange for a seventh of voldemorts soul the ring is no longer a horcrux but how did you find it well a you now know for many year i have made it my business to discover a much a i can about voldemorts past life i have traveled widely visiting those place he once knew i stumbled across the ring hidden in the ruin of the gaunts house it seems that once voldemort had succeeded in sealing a piece of his soul inside it he did not want to wear it anymore he hid it protected by many powerful enchantment in the shack where his ancestor had once lived morfin having been carted off to azkaban of course never guessing that i might one day take the trouble to visit the ruin or that i might be keeping an eye open for trace of magical concealment however we should not congratulate ourselves too heartily you destroyed the diary and i the ring but if we are right in our theory of a sevenpart soul four horcruxes remain and they could be anything said harry they could be old tin can or i do not know empty potion bottle page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you are thinking of portkeys harry which must be ordinary object easy to overlook but would lord voldemort use tin can or old potion bottle to guard his own precious soul you are forgetting what i have showed you lord voldemort liked to collect trophy and he preferred object with a powerful magical history his pride his belief in his own superiority his determination to carve for himself a startling place in magical history these thing suggest to me that voldemort would have chosen his horcruxes with some care favoring object worthy of the honor the diary wa not that special the diary a you have said yourself wa proof that he wa the heir of slytherin i am sure that voldemort considered it of stupendous importance so the other horcruxes said harry do you think you know what they are sir i can only guess said dumbledore for the reason i have already given i believe that lord voldemort would prefer object that in themselves have a certain grandeur i have therefore trawled back through voldemorts past to see if i can find evidence that such artifact have disappeared around him the locket said harry loudly hufflepuffs cup yes said dumbledore smiling i would be prepared to bet perhaps not my other hand but a couple of finger that they became horcruxes three and four the remaining two assuming again that he created a total of six are more of a problem but i will hazard a guess that having secured object from hufflepuff and slytherin he set out to track down object owned by gryffindor or ravenclaw four object from the four founder would i am sure have page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling exerted a powerful pull over voldemorts imagination i can not answer for whether he ever managed to find anything of ravenclaws i am confident however that the only known relic of gryffindor remains safe dumbledore pointed his blackened finger to the wall behind him where a rubyencrusted sword reposed within a glass case do you think that is why he really wanted to come back to hogwarts sir said harry to try and find something from one of the other founder my thought precisely said dumbledore but unfortunately that doe not advance u much further for he wa turned away or so i believe without the chance to search the school i am forced to conclude that he never fulfilled his ambition of collecting four founder object he definitely had two he may have found three that is the best we can do for now even if he got something of ravenclaws or of gryffindors that leaf a sixth horcrux said harry counting on his finger unless he got both i do not think so said dumbledore i think i know what the sixth horcrux is i wonder what you will say when i confess that i have been curious for a while about the behavior of the snake nagini the snake said harry startled you can use animal a horcruxes well it is inadvisable to do so said dumbledore because to confide a part of your soul to something that can think and move for itself is obviously a very risky business however if my calculation are correct voldemort wa still at least one horcrux short page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling of his goal of six when he entered your parent house with the intention of killing you he seems to have reserved the process of making horcruxes for particularly significant death you would certainly have been that he believed that in killing you he wa destroying the danger the prophecy had outlined he believed he wa making himself invincible i am sure that he wa intending to make his final horcrux with your death a we know he failed after an interval of some year however he used nagini to kill an old muggle man and it might then have occurred to him to turn her into his last horcrux she underline the slytherin connection which enhances lord voldemorts mystique i think he is perhaps a fond of her a he can be of anything he certainly like to keep her close and he seems to have an unusual amount of control over her even for a parselmouth so said harry the diary gone the ring gone the cup the locket and the snake are still intact and you think there might be a horcrux that wa once ravenclaws or gryffindors an admirably succinct and accurate summary yes said dumbledore bowing his head so are you still looking for them sir is that where you have been going when you have been leaving the school correct said dumbledore i have been looking for a very long time i think perhaps i may be close to finding another one there are hopeful sign and if you do said harry quickly can i come with you and help get rid of it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore looked at harry very intently for a moment before saying yes i think so i can said harry thoroughly taken aback oh yes said dumbledore smiling slightly i think you have earned that right harry felt his heart lift it wa very good not to hear word of caution and protection for once the headmaster and headmistress around the wall seemed le impressed by dumbledores decision harry saw a few of them shaking their head and phineas nigellus actually snorted doe voldemort know when a horcrux is destroyed sir can he feel it harry asked ignoring the portrait a very interesting question harry i believe not i believe that voldemort is now so immersed in evil and these crucial part of himself have been detached for so long he doe not feel a we do perhaps at the point of death he might be aware of his loss but he wa not aware for instance that the diary had been destroyed until he forced the truth out of lucius malfoy when voldemort discovered that the diary had been mutilated and robbed of all it power i am told that his anger wa terrible to behold but i thought he meant lucius malfoy to smuggle it into hogwarts yes he did year ago when he wa sure he would be able to create more horcruxes but still lucius wa supposed to wait for voldemorts sayso and he never received it for voldemort vanished shortly after giving him the diary page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no doubt he thought that lucius would not dare do anything with the horcrux other than guard it carefully but he wa counting too much upon luciuss fear of a master who had been gone for year and whom lucius believed dead of course lucius did not know what the diary really wa i understand that voldemort had told him the diary would cause the chamber of secret to reopen because it wa cleverly enchanted had lucius known he held a portion of his master soul in his hand he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own end by planting the diary upon arthur weasleys daughter he hoped to discredit arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke ah poor lucius what with voldemort s fury about the fact that he threw away the horcrux for his own gain and the fiasco at the ministry last year i would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in azkaban at the moment harry sat in thought for a moment then asked so if all of his horcruxes are destroyed voldemort could be killed yes i think so said dumbledore without his horcruxes voldemort will be a mortal man with a maimed and diminished soul never forget though that while his soul may be damaged beyond repair his brain and his magical power remain intact it will take uncommon skill and power to kill a wizard like voldemort even without his horcruxes but i have not got uncommon skill and power said harry before he could stop himself yes you have said dumbledore firmly you have a power that voldemort ha never had you can page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i know said harry impatiently i can love it wa only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding big deal yes harry you can love said dumbledore who looked a though he knew perfectly well what harry had just refrained from saying which given everything that ha happened to you is a great and remarkable thing you are still too young to understand how unusual you are harry so when the prophecy say that ill have power the dark lord know not it just mean love asked harry feeling a little let down yes just love said dumbledore but harry never forget that what the prophecy say is only significant because voldemort made it so i told you this at the end of last year voldemort singled you out a the person who would be most dangerous to him and in doing so he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him but it come to the same no it doe not said dumbledore sounding impatient now pointing at harry with his black withered hand he said you are setting too much store by the prophecy but spluttered harry but you said the prophecy mean if voldemort had never heard of the prophecy would it have been fulfilled would it have meant anything of course not do you think every prophecy in the hall of prophecy ha been fulfilled page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but said harry bewildered but last year you said one of u would have to kill the other harry harry only because voldemort made a grave error and acted on professor trelawneys word if voldemort had never murdered your father would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge of course not if he had not forced your mother to die for you would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate of course not harry do not you see voldemort himself created his worst enemy just a tyrant everywhere do have you any idea how much tyrant fear the people they oppress all of them realize that one day amongst their many victim there is sure to be one who rise against them and strike back voldemort is no different always he wa on the lookout for the one who would challenge him he heard the prophecy and he leapt into action with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him he handed him uniquely deadly weapon but it is essential that you understand this said dumbledore standing up and striding about the room his glittering robe swooshing in his wake harry had never seen him so agitated by attempting to kill you voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me and gave him the tool for the job it is voldemort s fault that you were able to see into his thought his ambition that you even understand the snakelike language in which he give order and yet harry despite your privileged insight into voldemorts world which incidentally is a gift any death eater would kill to have you have never been seduced by the dark art never even for a second shown the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling slightest desire to become one of voldemorts follower of course i have not said harry indignantly he killed my mum and dad you are protected in short by your ability to love said dumbledore loudly the only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like voldemorts in spite of all the temptation you have endured all the suffering you remain pure of heart just a pure a you were at the age of eleven when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart desire and it showed you only the way to thwart lord voldemort and not immortality or rich harry have you any idea how few wizard could have seen what you saw in that mirror voldemort should have known then what he wa dealing with but he did not but he know it now you have flitted into lord voldemorts mind without damage to yourself but he can not posse you without enduring mortal agony a he discovered in the ministry i do not think he understands why harry but then he wa in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole but sir said harry making valiant effort not to sound argumentative it all come to the same thing doe not it i have got to try and kill him or got to said dumbledore of course you have got to but not because of the prophecy because you yourself will never rest until you have tried we both know it imagine please just for a moment that you had never heard that prophecy how would you feel about voldemort now think page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry watched dumbledore striding up and down in front of him and thought he thought of his mother his father and sirius he thought of cedric diggory he thought of all the terrible deed he knew lord voldemort had done a flame seemed to leap inside his chest searing his throat id want him finished said harry quietly and id want to do it of course you would cried dumbledore you see the prophecy doe not mean you have to do anything but the prophecy caused lord voldemort to mark you a his equal in other word you are free to choose your way quite free to turn your back on the prophecy but voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy he will continue to hunt you which make it certain really that that one of u is going to end up killing the other said harry yes but he understood at last what dumbledore had been trying to tell him it wa he thought the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high some people perhaps would say that there wa little to choose between the two way but dumbledore knew and so do i thought harry with a rush of fierce pride and so did my parent that there wa all the difference in the world page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling sectumsempra exhausted but delighted with his night work harry told ron and hermione everything that had happened during next morning charm lesson having first cast the muffliato spell upon those nearest them they were both satisfyingly impressed by the way he had wheedled the memory out of slughorn and positively awed when he told them about voldemorts horcruxes and dumbledores promise to take harry along should he find another one wow said ron when harry had finally finished telling them everything ron wa waving his wand very vaguely in the direction of the ceiling without paying the slightest bit of attention to what he wa doing wow you are actually going to go with dumbledore and try and destroy wow ron you are making it snow said hermione patiently grabbing his wrist and redirecting his wand away from the ceiling from which sure enough large white flake had started to fall lavender brown page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry noticed glared at hermione from a neighboring table through very red eye and hermione immediately let go of ron arm oh yeah said ron looking down at his shoulder in vague surprise sorry look like we have all got horrible dandruff now he brushed some of the fake snow off hermione s shoulder lavender burst into tear ron looked immensely guilty and turned his back on her we split up he told harry out of the corner of his mouth last night when she saw me coming out of the dormitory with hermione obviously she could not see you so she thought it had just been the two of u ah said harry well you do not mind it over do you no ron admitted it wa pretty bad while she wa yelling but at least i did not have to finish it coward said hermione though she looked amused well it wa a bad night for romance all around ginny and dean split up too harry harry thought there wa a rather knowing look in her eye a she told him that but she could not possibly know that his inside were suddenly dancing the conga keeping his face a immobile and his voice a indifferent a he could he asked how come oh something really silly she said he wa always trying to help her through the portrait hole like she could not climb in herself but they have been a bit rocky for age page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry glanced over at dean on the other side of the classroom he certainly looked unhappy of course this put you in a bit of a dilemma doe not it said hermione what dyou mean said harry quickly the quidditch team said hermione if ginny and dean are not speaking oh oh yeah said harry flitwick said ron in a warning tone the tiny little charm master wa bobbing his way toward them and hermione wa the only one who had managed to turn vinegar into wine her glass flask wa full of deep crimson liquid whereas the content of harrys and ron were still murky brown now now boy squeaked professor flitwick reproachfully a little le talk a little more action let me see you try together they raised their wand concentrating with all their might and pointed them at their flask harrys vinegar turned to ice ron flask exploded yes for homework said professor flitwick reemerging from under the table and pulling shard of glass out of the top of his hat practice they had one of their rare joint free period after charm and walked back to the common room together ron seemed to be positively lighthearted about the end of his relationship with lavender and hermione seemed cheery too though when asked what she wa grinning about she simply said it a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling nice day neither of them seemed to have noticed that a fierce battle wa raging inside harrys brain she is ron sister but she is ditched dean she is still ron sister i am his best mate that will make it worse if i talked to him first he would hit you what if i do not care he your best mate harry barely noticed that they were climbing through the portrait hole into the sunny common room and only vaguely registered the small group of seventh year clustered together there until hermione cried katie you are back are you okay harry stared it wa indeed katie bell looking completely healthy and surrounded by her jubilant friend i am really well she said happily they let me out of st mungos on monday i had a couple of day at home with mum and dad and then came back here this morning leanne wa just telling me about mclaggen and the last match harry yeah said harry well now you are back and ron fit well have a decent chance of thrashing page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ravenclaw which mean we could still be in the running for the cup listen katie he had to put the question to her at once his curiosity even drove ginny temporarily from his brain he dropped his voice a katies friend started gathering up their thing apparently they were late for transfiguration that necklace can you remember who gave it to you now no said katie shaking her head ruefully everyone is been asking me but i have not got a clue the last thing i remember wa walking into the lady in the three broomstick you definitely went into the bathroom then said hermione well i know i pushed open the door said katie so i suppose whoever imperiused me wa standing just behind it after that my memory a blank until about two week ago in st mungos listen id better go i would not put it past mcgonagall to give me line even if it is my first day back she caught up her bag and book and hurried after her friend leaving harry ron and hermione to sit down at a window table and ponder what she had told them so it must have been a girl or a woman who gave katie the necklace said hermione to be in the lady bathroom or someone who looked like a girl or a woman said harry do not forget there wa a cauldron full of page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling polyjuice potion at hogwarts we know some of it got stolen in his mind eye he watched a parade of crabbes and goyles prance past all transformed into girl i think i am going to take another swig of felix said harry and have a go at the room of requirement again that would be a complete waste of potion said hermione flatly putting down the copy of spellmans syllabary she had just taken out of her bag luck can only get you so far harry the situation with slughorn wa different you always had the ability to persuade him you just needed to tweak the circumstance a bit luck is not enough to get you through a powerful enchantment though do not go wasting the rest of that potion you will need all the luck you can get if dumbledore take you along with him she dropped her voice to a whisper could not we make some more ron asked harry ignoring hermione it would be great to have a stock of it have a look in the book harry pulled his copy of advanced potionmaking out of his bag and looked up felix felicis blimey it seriously complicated he said running an eye down the list of ingredient and it take six month you have got to let it stew typical said ron harry wa about to put his book away again when he noticed the corner of a page folded down turning to it he saw the sectumsempra spell captioned for enemy that he had marked a few week page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling previously he had still not found out what it did mainly because he did not want to test it around hermione but he wa considering trying it out on mclaggen next time he came up behind him unawares the only person who wa not particularly pleased to see katie bell back at school wa dean thomas because he would no longer be required to fill her place a chaser he took the blow stoically enough when harry told him merely grunting and shrugging but harry had the distinct feeling a he walked away that dean and seamus were muttering mutinously behind his back the following fortnight saw the best quidditch practice harry had known a captain his team wa so pleased to be rid of mclaggen so glad to have katie back at last that they were flying extremely well ginny did not seem at all upset about the breakup with dean on the contrary she wa the life and soul of the team her imitation of ron anxiously bobbing up and down in front of the goal post a the quaffle sped toward him or of harry bellowing order at mclaggen before being knocked out cold kept them all highly amused harry laughing with the others wa glad to have an innocent reason to look at ginny he had received several more bludger injury during practice because he had not been keeping his eye on the snitch the battle still raged inside his head ginny or ron sometimes he thought that the postlavender ron might not mind too much if he asked ginny out but then he remembered ron expression when he had seen her kissing dean and wa sure that ron would page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling consider it base treachery if harry so much a held her hand yet harry could not help himself talking to ginny laughing with her walking back from practice with her however much his conscience ached he found himself wondering how best to get her on her own it would have been ideal if slughorn had given another of his little party for ron would not be around but unfortunately slughorn seemed to have given them up once or twice harry considered asking for hermiones help but he did not think he could stand seeing the smug look on her face he thought he caught it sometimes when hermione spotted him staring at ginny or laughing at her joke and to complicate matter he had the nagging worry that if he did not do it somebody else wa sure to ask ginny out soon he and ron were at least agreed on the fact that she wa too popular for her own good all in all the temptation to take another gulp of felix felicis wa becoming stronger by the day for surely this wa a case for a hermione put it tweaking the circumstance the balmy day slid gently through may and ron seemed to be there at harrys shoulder every time he saw ginny harry found himself longing for a stroke of luck that would somehow because ron to realize that nothing would make him happier than his best friend and his sister falling for each other and to leave them alone together for longer than a few second there seemed no chance of either while the final quidditch game of the season wa looming ron wanted to talk tactic with harry all the time and had little thought for anything else ron wa not unique in this respect interest in the gryffindorravenclaw game wa running extremely high throughout the school for the match would decide the championship which wa still wide open page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling if gryffindor beat ravenclaw by a margin of three hundred point a tall order and yet harry had never known his team to fly better then they would win the championship if they won by le than three hundred point they would come second to ravenclaw if they lost by a hundred point they would be third behind hufflepuff and if they lost by more than a hundred they would be in fourth place and nobody harry thought would ever ever let him forget that it had been he who had captained gryffindor to their first bottomofthetable defeat in two century the runup to this crucial match had all the usual feature member of rival house attempting to intimidate opposing team in the corridor unpleasant chant about individual player being rehearsed loudly a they passed the team member themselves either swaggering around enjoying all the attention or else dashing into bathroom between class to throw up somehow the game had become inextricably linked in harrys mind with success or failure in his plan for ginny he could not help feeling that if they won by more than three hundred point the scene of euphoria and a nice loud after match party might be just a good a a hearty swig of felix felicis in the midst of all his preoccupation harry had not forgotten his other ambition finding out what malfoy wa up to in the room of requirement he wa still checking the marauder map and a he wa unable to locate malfoy on it deduced that malfoy wa still spending plenty of time within the room although harry wa losing hope that he would ever succeed in getting inside the room of requirement he attempted it whenever he wa in the vicinity but no matter how he reworded his request the wall remained firmly doorless page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling a few day before the match against ravenclaw harry found himself walking down to dinner alone from the common room ron having rushed off into a nearby bathroom to throw up yet again and hermione having dashed off to see professor vector about a mistake she thought she might have made in her last arithmancy essay more out of habit than anything harry made his usual detour along the seventhfloor corridor checking the marauder map a he went for a moment he could not find malfoy anywhere and assumed he must indeed be inside the room of requirement again but then he saw malfoys tiny labeled dot standing in a boy bathroom on the floor below accompanied not by crabbe or goyle but by moaning myrtle harry only stopped staring at this unlikely coupling when he walked right into a suit of armor the loud crash brought him out of his reverie hurrying from the scene lest filch turn up he dashed down the marble staircase and along the passageway below outside the bathroom he pressed his ear against the door he could not hear anything he very quietly pushed the door open draco malfoy wa standing with his back to the door his hand clutching either side of the sink his white blond head bowed do not crooned moaning myrtle voice from one of the cubicle do not tell me what is wrong i can help you no one can help me said malfoy his whole body wa shaking i can not do it i can not it will not work and unless i do it soon he say hell kill me and harry realized with a shock so huge it seemed to root him to the spot that malfoy wa cry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling actually cry tear streaming down his pale face into the grimy basin malfoy gasped and gulped and then with a great shudder looked up into the cracked mirror and saw harry staring at him over his shoulder malfoy wheeled around drawing his wand instinctively harry pulled out his own malfoys hex missed harry by inch shattering the lamp on the wall beside him harry threw himself sideways thought levicorpus and flicked his wand but malfoy blocked the jinx and raised his wand for another no no stop it squealed moaning myrtle her voice echoing loudly around the tiled room stop stop there wa a loud bang and the bin behind harry exploded harry attempted a leglocker curse that backfired off the wall behind malfoys ear and smashed the cistern beneath moaning myrtle who screamed loudly water poured everywhere and harry slipped a malfoy his face contorted cried cruci sectumsempral bellowed harry from the floor waving his wand wildly blood spurted from malfoys face and chest a though he had been slashed with an invisible sword he staggered backward and collapsed onto the waterlogged floor with a great splash his wand falling from his limp right hand no gasped harry slipping and staggering harry got to his foot and plunged toward malfoy whose face wa now shining scarlet his white hand scrabbling at his blood soaked chest page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no i did not harry did not know what he wa saying he fell to his knee beside malfoy who wa shaking uncontrollably in a pool of his own blood moaning myrtle let out a deafening scream murder murder in the bathroom murder the door banged open behind harry and he looked up terrified snape had burst into the room his face livid pushing harry roughly aside he knelt over malfoy drew his wand and traced it over the deep wound harrys curse had made muttering an incantation that sounded almost like song the flow of blood seemed to ease snape wiped the residue from malfoys face and repeated his spell now the wound seemed to be knitting harry wa still watching horrified by what he had done barely aware that he too wa soaked in blood and water moaning myrtle wa still sobbing and wailing overhead when snape had performed his countercurse for the third time he halflifted malfoy into a standing position you need the hospital wing there may be a certain amount of scarring but if you take dittany immediately we might avoid even that come he supported malfoy across the bathroom turning at the door to say in a voice of cold fury and you potter you wait here for me it did not occur to harry for a second to disobey he stood up slowly shaking and looked down at the wet floor there were bloodstain floating like crimson flower across it surface he could not even find it in himself to tell moaning myrtle to be quiet a she page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling continued to wail and sob with increasingly evident enjoyment snape returned ten minute later he stepped into the bathroom and closed the door behind him go he said to myrtle and she swooped back into her toilet at once leaving a ringing silence behind her i did not mean it to happen said harry at once his voice echoed in the cold watery space i did not know what that spell did but snape ignored this apparently i underestimated you potter he said quietly who would have thought you knew such dark magic who taught you that spell i read about it somewhere where it wa a library book harry invented wildly i can not remember what it wa call liar said snape harrys throat went dry he knew what snape wa going to do and he had never been able to prevent it the bathroom seemed to shimmer before his eye he struggled to block out all thought but try a he might the halfblood prince copy of advanced potionmaking swam hazily to the forefront of his mind and then he wa staring at snape again in the midst of this wrecked soaked bathroom he stared into page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling snapes black eye hoping against hope that snape had not seen what he feared but bring me your schoolbag said snape softly and all of your schoolbook all of them bring them to me here now there wa no point arguing harry turned at once and splashed out of the bathroom once in the corridor he broke into a run toward gryffindor tower most people were walking the other way they gaped at him drenched in water and blood but he answered none of the question fired at him a he ran past he felt stunned it wa a though a beloved pet had turned suddenly savage what had the prince been thinking to copy such a spell into his book and what would happen when snape saw it would he tell slughorn harrys stomach churned how harry had been achieving such good result in potion all year would he confiscate or destroy the book that had taught harry so much the book that had become a kind of guide and friend harry could not let it happen he could not where ve you why are you soaking is that blood ron wa standing at the top of the stair looking bewildered at the sight of harry i need your book harry panted your potion book quick give it to me but what about the halfblood ill explain later page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ron pulled his copy of advanced potionmaking out of his bag and handed it over harry sprinted off past him and back to the common room here he seized his schoolbag ignoring the amazed look of several people who had already finished their dinner threw himself back out of the portrait hole and hurtled off along the seventhfloor corridor he skidded to a halt beside the tapestry of dancing troll closed his eye and began to walk i need a place to hide my book i need a place to hide my book i need a place to hide my book three time he walked up and down in front of the stretch of blank wall when he opened his eye there it wa at last the door to the room of requirement harry wrenched it open flung himself inside and slammed it shut he gasped despite his haste his panic his fear of what awaited him back in the bathroom he could not help but be overawed by what he wa looking at he wa standing in a room the size of a large cathedral whose high window were sending shaft of light down upon what looked like a city with towering wall built of what harry knew must be object hidden by generation of hogwarts inhabitant there were alleyway and road bordered by teetering pile of broken and damaged furniture stowed away perhaps to hide the evidence of mishandled magic or else hidden by castleproud houseelves there were thousand and thousand of book no doubt banned or graffitied or stolen there were winged catapult and fanged frisbee some still with enough life in them to hover halfheartedly over the mountain of other forbidden item there were chipped bottle of congealed potion hat jewel cloak there were what looked like dragon eggshell corked bottle page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling whose content still shimmered evilly several rusting sword and a heavy bloodstained axe harry hurried forward into one of the many alleyway between all this hidden treasure he turned right past an enormous stuffed troll ran on a short way took a left at the broken vanishing cabinet in which montague had got lost the previous year finally pausing beside a large cupboard that seemed to have had acid thrown at it blistered surface he opened one of the cupboard creaking door it had already been used a a hiding place for something in a cage that had long since died it skeleton had five leg he stuffed the halfblood prince book behind the cage and slammed the door he paused for a moment his heart thumping horribly gazing around at all the clutter would he be able to find this spot again amidst all this junk seizing the chipped bust of an ugly old warlock from on top of a nearby crate he stood it on top of the cupboard where the book wa now hidden perched a dusty old wig and a tarnished tiara on the statue head to make it more distinctive then sprinted back through the alleyway of hidden junk a fast a he could go back to the door back out onto the corridor where he slammed the door behind him and it turned at once back into stone harry ran flatout toward the bathroom on the floor below cramming ron copy of advanced potion making into his bag a he did so a minute later he wa back in front of snape who held out his hand wordlessly for harrys schoolbag harry handed it over panting a searing pain in his chest and waited one by one snape extracted harrys book and examined them finally the only book left wa the potion book which he looked at very carefully before speaking page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling this is your copy of advanced potionmaking is it potter yes said harry still breathing hard you are quite sure of that are you potter yes said harry with a touch more defiance this is the copy of advanced potionmaking that you purchased from flourish and blotts yes said harry firmly then why asked snape doe it have the name roonil wazlib written inside the front cover harrys heart missed a beat that is my nickname he said your nickname repeated snape yeah that is what my friend call me said harry i understand what a nickname is said snape the cold black eye were boring once more into harrys he tried not to look into them close your mind close your mind but he had never learned how to do it properly do you know what i think potter said snape very quietly i think that you are a liar and a cheat and that you deserve detention with me every saturday until the end of term what do you think potter i i do not agree sir said harry still refusing to look into snape s eye page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well we shall see how you feel after your detention said snape ten of the clock saturday morning potter my office but sir said harry looking up desperately quidditch the last match of the ten of the clock whispered snape with a smile that showed his yellow teeth poor gryffindor fourth place this year i fear and he left the bathroom without another word leaving harry to stare into the cracked mirror feeling sicker he wa sure than ron had ever felt in his life i will not say i told you so said hermione an hour later in the common room leave it hermione said ron angrily harry had never made it to dinner he had no appetite at all he had just finished telling ron hermione and ginny what had happened not that there seemed to have been much need the news had traveled very fast apparently moaning myrtle had taken it upon herself to pop up in every bathroom in the castle to tell the story malfoy had already been visited in the hospital wing by pansy parkinson who had lost no time in vilifying harry far and wide and snape had told the staff precisely what had happened harry had already been called out of the common room to endure fifteen highly unpleasant minute in the company of professor mcgonagall who had told him he wa lucky not to have been expelled and that she supported wholeheartedly snape s punishment of detention every saturday until the end of term page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i told you there wa something wrong with that prince person hermione said evidently unable to stop herself and i wa right wa not i no i do not think you were said harry stubbornly he wa having a bad enough time without hermione lecturing him the look on the gryffindor team face when he had told them he would not be able to play on saturday had been the worst punishment of all he could feel ginnys eye on him now but did not meet them he did not want to see disappointment or anger there he had just told her that she would be playing seeker on saturday and that dean would be rejoining the team a chaser in her place perhaps if they won ginny and dean would make up during the postmatch euphoria the thought went through harry like an icy knife harry said hermione how can you still stick up for that book when that spell will you stop harping on about the book snapped harry the prince only copied it out it not like he wa advising anyone to use it for all we know he wa making a note of something that had been used against him i do not believe this said hermione you are actually defending i am not defending what i did said harry quickly i wish i had not done it and not just because i have got about a dozen detention you know i would not have used a spell like that not even on malfoy but you can not blame the prince he had not written try this out it really good he wa just making note for himself wa not he not for anyone else page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling are you telling me said hermione that you are going to go back and get the book yeah i am said harry forcefully listen without the prince id never have won the felix felicis id never have known how to save ron from poisoning id never have got a reputation for potion brilliance you do not deserve said hermione nastily give it a rest hermione said ginny and harry wa so amazed so grateful he looked up by the sound of it malfoy wa trying to use an unforgivable curse you should be glad harry had something good up his sleeve well of course i am glad harry wa not cursed said hermione clearly stung but you can not call that sectumsempra spell good ginny look where it landed him and id have thought seeing what this ha done to your chance in the match oh do not start acting a though you understand quidditch snapped ginny you will only embarrass yourself harry and ron stared hermione and ginny who had always got on together very well were now sitting with their arm folded glaring in opposite direction ron looked nervously at harry then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it harry however little though he knew he deserved it felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening his lightheartedness wa shortlived there were slytherin taunt to be endured next day not to mention much anger from fellow gryffindors who page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling were most unhappy that their captain had got himself banned from the final match of the season by saturday morning whatever he might have told hermione harry would have gladly exchanged all the felix felicis in the world to be walking down to the quidditch pitch with ron ginny and the others it wa almost unbearable to turn away from the mass of student streaming out into the sunshine all of them wearing rosette and hat and brandishing banner and scarf to descend the stone step into the dungeon and walk until the distant sound of the crowd were quite obliterated knowing that he would not be able to hear a word of commentary or a cheer or groan ah potter said snape when harry had knocked on his door and entered the unpleasantly familiar office that snape despite teaching floor above now had not vacated it wa a dimly lit a ever and the same slimy dead object were suspended in colored potion all around the wall ominously there were many cobwebbed box piled on a table where harry wa clearly supposed to sit they had an aura of tedious hard and pointless work about them mr filch ha been looking for someone to clear out these old file said snape softly they are the record of other hogwarts wrongdoer and their punishment where the ink ha grown faint or the card have suffered damage from mouse we would like you to copy out the crime and punishment afresh and making sure that they are in alphabetical order replace them in the box you will not use magic right professor said harry with a much contempt a he could put into the last three syllable i thought you could start said snape a malicious smile on his lip with box one thousand and page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling twelve to one thousand and fiftysix you will find some familiar name in there which should add interest to the task here you see he pulled out a card from one of the topmost box with a flourish and read james potter and sirius black apprehended using an illegal hex upon bertram aubrey aubreys head twice normal size double detention snape sneered it must be such a comfort to think that though they are gone a record of their great achievement remains harry felt the familiar boiling sensation in the pit of his stomach biting his tongue to prevent himself retaliating he sat down in front of the box and pulled one toward him it wa a harry had anticipated useless boring work punctuated a snape had clearly planned with the regular jolt in the stomach that meant he had just read his father or sirius name usually coupled together in various petty misdeed occasionally accompanied by those of remus lupin and peter pettigrew and while he copied out all their various offense and punishment he wondered what wa going on outside where the match would have just started ginny playing seeker against cho harry glanced again and again at the large clock ticking on the wall it seemed to be moving half a fast a a regular clock perhaps snape had bewitched it to go extra slowly he could not have been here for only half an hour an hour an hour and a half harrys stomach started rumbling when the clock showed half past twelve snape who had not spoken at all since setting harry his task finally looked up at ten past one page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i think that will do he said coldly mark the place you have reached you will continue at ten of the clock next saturday yes sir harry stuffed a bent card into the box at random and hurried out of the door before snape could change his mind racing back up the stone step straining his ear to hear a sound from the pitch but all wa quiet it wa over then he hesitated outside the crowded great hall then ran up the marble staircase whether gryffindor had won or lost the team usually celebrated or commiserated in their own common room quid agis he said tentatively to the fat lady wondering what he would find inside her expression wa unreadable a she replied you will see and she swung forward a roar of celebration erupted from the hole behind her harry gaped a people began to scream at the sight of him several hand pulled him into the room we won yelled ron bounding into sight and brandishing the silver cup at harry we won four hundred and fifty to a hundred and forty we won harry looked around there wa ginny running toward him she had a hard blazing look in her face a she threw her arm around him and without thinking without planning it without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching harry kissed her page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling after several long moment or it might have been half an hour or possibly several sunlit day they broke apart the room had gone very quiet then several people wolfwhistled and there wa an outbreak of nervous giggling harry looked over the top of ginnys head to see dean thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and romilda vane looking a though she might throw something hermione wa beaming but harrys eye sought ron at last he found him still clutching the cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head for a fraction of a second they looked at each other then ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that harry understood to mean well if you must the creature in his chest roaring in triumph he grinned down at ginny and gestured wordlessly out of the portrait hole a long walk in the ground seemed indicated during which if they had time they might discus the match page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the seer overheard the fact that harry potter wa going out with ginny weasley seemed to interest a great number of people most of them girl yet harry found himself newly and happily impervious to gossip over the next few week after all it made a very nice change to be talked about because of something that wa making him happier than he could remember being for a very long time rather than because he had been involved in horrific scene of dark magic you would think people had better thing to gossip about said ginny a she sat on the common room floor leaning against harrys leg and reading the daily prophet three dementor attack in a week and all romilda vane doe is ask me if it true you have got a hippogriff tattooed across your chest ron and hermione both roared with laughter harry ignored them what did you tell her page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i told her it a hungarian horntail said ginny turning a page of the newspaper idly much more macho thanks said harry grinning and what did you tell her ron got a pygmy puff but i did not say where ron scowled a hermione rolled around laughing watch it he said pointing warningly at harry and ginny just because i have given my permission doe not mean i can not withdraw it your permission scoffed ginny since when did you give me permission to do anything anyway you said yourself you would rather it wa harry than michael or dean yeah i would said ron grudgingly and just a long a you do not start snogging each other in public you filthy hypocrite what about you and lavender thrashing around like a pair of eel all over the place demanded ginny but ron tolerance wa not to be tested much a they moved into june for harry and ginnys time together wa becoming increasingly restricted ginnys owl were approaching and she wa therefore forced to study for hour into the night on one such evening when ginny had retired to the library and harry wa sitting beside the window in the common room supposedly finishing his herbology homework but in reality reliving a particularly happy hour he had spent down by the lake with ginny at lunchtime hermione dropped into page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the seat between him and ron with an unpleasantly purposeful look on her face i want to talk to you harry what about said harry suspiciously only the previous day hermione had told him off for distracting ginny when she ought to be working hard for her examination the socalled halfblood prince oh not again he groaned will you please drop it he had not dared to return to the room of requirement to retrieve his book and his performance in potion wa suffering accordingly though slughorn who approved of ginny had jocularly attributed this to harry being lovesick but harry wa sure that snape had not yet given up hope of laying hand on the prince book and wa determined to leave it where it wa while snape remained on the lookout i am not dropping it said hermione firmly until you have heard me out now i have been trying to find out a bit about who might make a hobby of inventing dark spell he did not make a hobby of it he he who say it a he we have been through this said harry crossly prince hermione princev right said hermione red patch blazing in her cheek a she pulled a very old piece of newsprint out page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling of her pocket and slammed it down on the table in front of harry look at that look at the picture harry picked up the crumbling piece of paper and stared at the moving photograph yellowed with age ron leaned over for a look too the picture showed a skinny girl of around fifteen she wa not pretty she looked simultaneously cross and sullen with heavy brow and a long pallid face underneath the photograph wa the caption eileen prince captain of the hogwarts gobstones team so said harry scanning the short news item to which the picture belonged it wa a rather dull story about interschool competition her name wa eileen prince prince harry they looked at each other and harry realized what hermione wa trying to say he burst out laughing no way what you think she wa the halfblood oh come on well why not harry there are not any real prince in the wizarding world it either a nickname a made up title somebody is given themselves or it could be their actual name could not it no listen if say her father wa a wizard whose surname wa prince and her mother wa a muggle then that would make her a halfblood prince yeah very ingenious hermione but it would maybe she wa proud of being half a prince page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling listen hermione i can tell it not a girl i can just tell the truth is that you do not think a girl would have been clever enough said hermione angrily how can i have hung round with you for five year and not think girl are clever said harry stung by this it the way he writes i just know the prince wa a bloke i can tell this girl ha not got anything to do with it where did you get this anyway the library said hermione predictably there is a whole collection of old prophet up there well i am going to find out more about eileen prince if i can enjoy yourself said harry irritably i will said hermione and the first place ill look she shot at him a she reached the portrait hole is record of old potion award harry scowled after her for a moment then continued his contemplation of the darkening sky she is just never got over you outperforming her in potion said ron returning to his copy of a thousand magical herb and fungi you do not think i am mad wanting that book back do you course not said ron robustly he wa a genius the prince anyway without his bezoar tip he drew his finger significantly across his own throat i would not be here to discus it would i i mean i am not saying that spell you used on malfoy wa great nor am i said harry quickly page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but he healed all right did not he back on his foot in no time yeah said harry this wa perfectly true although his conscience squirmed slightly all the same thanks to snape you still got detention with snape this saturday ron continued yeah and the saturday after that and the saturday after that sighed harry and he hinting now that if i do not get all the box done by the end of term well carry on next year he wa finding these detention particularly irksome because they cut into the already limited time he could have been spending with ginny indeed he had frequently wondered lately whether snape did not know this for he wa keeping harry later and later every time while making pointed aside about harry having to miss the good weather and the varied opportunity it offered harry wa shaken from these bitter reflection by the appearance at his side of jimmy peakes who wa holding out a scroll of parchment thanks jimmy hey it from dumbledore said harry excitedly unrolling the parchment and scanning it he want me to go to his office a quick a i can they stared at each other blimey whispered ron you do not reckon he ha not found page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling better go and see had not i said harry jumping to his foot he hurried out of the common room and along the seventh floor a fast a he could passing nobody but peeve who swooped past in the opposite direction throwing bit of chalk at harry in a routine sort of way and cackling loudly a he dodged harrys defensive jinx once peeve had vanished there wa silence in the corridor with only fifteen minute left until curfew most people had already returned to their common room and then harry heard a scream and a crash he stopped in his track listening how dare you aaaaargh the noise wa coming from a corridor nearby harry sprinted toward it his wand at the ready hurtled around another corner and saw professor trelawney sprawled upon the floor her head covered in one of her many shawl several sherry bottle lying beside her one broken professor harry hurried forward and helped professor trelawney to her foot some of her glittering bead had become entangled with her glass she hiccuped loudly patted her hair and pulled herself up on harrys helping arm what happened professor you may well ask she said shrilly i wa strolling along brooding upon certain dark portent i happen to have glimpsed page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but harry wa not paying much attention he had just noticed where they were standing there on the right wa the tapestry of dancing troll and on the left that smoothly impenetrable stretch of stone wall that concealed professor were you trying to get into the room of requirement omen i have been vouchsafed what she looked suddenly shifty the room of requirement repeated harry were you trying to get in there i well i did not know student knew about not all of them do said harry but what happened you screamed it sounded a though you were hurt i well said professor trelawney drawing her shawl around her defensively and staring down at him with her vastly magnified eye i wished to ah deposit certain um personal item in the room and she muttered something about nasty accusation right said harry glancing down at the sherry bottle but you could not get in and hide them he found this very odd the room had opened for him after all when he had wanted to hide the halfblood prince book oh i got in all right said professor trelawney glaring at the wall but there wa somebody already in there page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling somebody in who demanded harry who wa in there i have no idea said professor trelawney looking slightly taken aback at the urgency in harrys voice i walked into the room and i heard a voice which ha never happened before in all my year of hiding of using the room i mean a voice saying what i do not know that it wa saying anything said professor trelawney it wa whooping whooping gleefully she said nodding harry stared at her wa it male or female i would hazard a guess at male said professor trelawney and it sounded happy very happy said professor trelawney sniffily a though it wa celebrating most definitely and then and then i called out who is there you could not have found out who it wa without asking harry asked her slightly frustrated page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the inner eye said professor trelawney with dignity straightening her shawl and many strand of glittering bead wa fixed upon matter well outside the mundane realm of whooping voice right said harry hastily he had heard about professor trelawneys inner eye all too often before and did the voice say who wa there no it did not she said everything went pitch black and the next thing i knew i wa being hurled headfirst out of the room and you did not see that coming said harry unable to help himself no i did not a i say it wa pitch she stopped and glared at him suspiciously i think you would better tell professor dumbledore said harry he ought to know malfoys celebrating i mean that someone threw you out of the room to his surprise professor trelawney drew herself up at this suggestion looking haughty the headmaster ha intimated that he would prefer fewer visit from me she said coldly i am not one to press my company upon those who do not value it if dumbledore chooses to ignore the warning the card show her bony hand closed suddenly around harrys wrist again and again no matter how i lay them out and she pulled a card dramatically from underneath her shawl the lightningstruck tower she whispered calamity disaster coming nearer all the time right said harry again well i still think you should tell dumbledore about this voice and page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling everything going dark and being thrown out of the room you think so professor trelawney seemed to consider the matter for a moment but harry could tell that she liked the idea of retelling her little adventure i am going to see him right now said harry i have got a meeting with him we could go together oh well in that case said professor trelawney with a smile she bent down scooped up her sherry bottle and dumped them unceremoniously in a large blueandwhite vase standing in a nearby niche i miss having you in my class harry she said soulfully a they set off together you were never much of a seer but you were a wonderful object harry did not reply he had loathed being the object of professor trelawneys continual prediction of doom i am afraid she went on that the nag i am sorry the centaur know nothing of cartomancy i asked him one seer to another had he not too sensed the distant vibration of coming catastrophe but he seemed to find me almost comical yes comical her voice rose rather hysterically and harry caught a powerful whiff of sherry even though the bottle had been left behind perhaps the horse ha heard people say that i have not inherited my greatgreatgrandmothers gift those rumor have been bandied about by the jealous for year you know what i say to such people harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling would dumbledore have let me teach at this great school put so much trust in me all these year had i not proved myself to him harry mumbled something indistinct i well remember my first interview with dumbledore went on professor trelawney in throaty tone he wa deeply impressed of course deeply impressed i wa staying at the hog head which i do not advise incidentally bedbug dear boy but fund were low dumbledore did me the courtesy of calling upon me in my room he questioned me i must confess that at first i thought he seemed illdisposed toward divination and i remember i wa starting to feel a little odd i had not eaten much that day but then and now harry wa paying attention properly for the first time for he knew what had happened then professor trelawney had made the prophecy that had altered the course of his whole life the prophecy about him and voldemort but then we were rudely interrupted by severus snape what yes there wa a commotion outside the door and it flew open and there wa that rather uncouth barman standing with snape who wa waffling about having come the wrong way up the stair although i am afraid that i myself rather thought he had been apprehended eavesdropping on my interview with dumbledore you see he himself wa seeking a job at the time and no doubt hoped to pick up tip well after that you know dumbledore seemed much more disposed to give me a job and i could not help page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling thinking harry that it wa because he appreciated the stark contrast between my own unassuming manner and quiet talent compared to the pushing thrusting young man who wa prepared to listen at keyhole harry dear she looked back over her shoulder having only just realized that harry wa no longer with her he had stopped walking and they were now ten foot from each other harry she repeated uncertainly perhaps his face wa white to make her look so concerned and frightened harry wa standing stock still a wave of shock crashed over him wave after wave obliterating everything except the information that had been kept from him for so long it wa snape who had overheard the prophecy it wa snape who had carried the news of the prophecy to voldemort snape and peter pettigrew together had sent voldemort hunting after lily and james and their son nothing else mattered to harry just now harry said professor trelawney again harry i thought we were going to see the headmaster together you stay here said harry through numb lip but dear i wa going to tell him how i wa assaulted in the room of you stay here harry repeated angrily page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she looked alarmed a he ran past her around the corner into dumbledores corridor where the lone gargoyle stood sentry harry shouted the password at the gargoyle and ran up the moving spiral staircase three step at a time he did not knock upon dumbledores door he hammered and the calm voice answered enter after harry had already flung himself into the room fawkes the phoenix looked around his bright black eye gleaming with reflected gold from the sunset beyond the window dumbledore wa standing at the window looking out at the ground a long black traveling cloak in his arm well harry i promised that you could come with me for a moment or two harry did not understand the conversation with trelawney had driven everything else out of his head and his brain seemed to be moving very slowly come with you only if you wish it of course if i and then harry remembered why he had been eager to come to dumbledores office in the first place you have found one you have found a horcrux i believe so rage and resentment fought shock and excitement for several moment harry could not speak it is natural to be afraid said dumbledore page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tm not scared said harry at once and it wa perfectly true fear wa one emotion he wa not feeling at all which horcrux is it where is it i am not sure which it is though i think we can rule out the snake but i believe it to be hidden in a cave on the coast many mile from here a cave i have been trying to locate for a very long time the cave in which tom riddle once terrorized two child from his orphanage on their annual trip you remember yes said harry how is it protected i do not know i have suspicion that may be entirely wrong dumbledore hesitated then said harry i promised you that you could come with me and i stand by that promise but it would be very wrong of me not to warn you that this will be exceedingly dangerous i am coming said harry almost before dumbledore had finished speaking boiling with anger at snape his desire to do something desperate and risky had increased tenfold in the last few minute this seemed to show on harrys face for dumbledore moved away from the window and looked more closely at harry a slight crease between his silver eyebrow what ha happened to you nothing lied harry promptly what ha upset you i am not upset harry you were never a good occlumens the word wa the spark that ignited harrys fury page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling snape he said very loudly and fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them snapes what is happened he told voldemort about the prophecy it wa him he listened outside the door trelawney told me dumbledores expression did not change but harry thought his face whitened under the bloody tinge cast by the setting sun for a long moment dumbledore said nothing when did you find out about this he asked at last just now said harry who wa refraining from yelling with enormous difficulty and then suddenly he could not stop himself and you let him teach here and he told voldemort to go after my mum and dad breathing hard a though he wa fighting harry turned away from dumbledore who still had not moved a muscle and paced up and down the study rubbing his knuckle in his hand and exercising every last bit of restraint to prevent himself knocking thing over he wanted to rage and storm at dumbledore but he also wanted to go with him to try and destroy the horcrux he wanted to tell him that he wa a foolish old man for trusting snape but he wa terrified that dumbledore would not take him along unless he mastered his anger harry said dumbledore quietly please listen to me it wa a difficult to stop his relentless pacing a to refrain from shouting harry paused biting his lip and looked into dumbledores lined face professor snape made a terrible page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling do not tell me it wa a mistake sir he wa listening at the door please let me finish dumbledore waited until harry had nodded curtly then went on professor snape made a terrible mistake he wa still in lord voldemorts employ on the night he heard the first half of professor trelawneys prophecy naturally he hastened to tell his master what he had heard for it concerned his master most deeply but he did not know he had no possible way of knowing which boy voldemort would hunt from then onward or that the parent he would destroy in his murderous quest were people that professor snape knew that they were your mother and father harry let out a yell of mirthless laughter he hated my dad like he hated sirius have not you noticed professor how the people snape hate tend to end up dead you have no idea of the remorse professor snape felt when he realized how lord voldemort had interpreted the prophecy harry i believe it to be the greatest regret of his life and the reason that he returned but he a very good occlumens is not he sir said harry whose voice wa shaking with the effort of keeping it steady and is not voldemort convinced that snapes on his side even now professor how can you be sure snapes on our side dumbledore did not speak for a moment he looked a though he wa trying to make up his mind about something at last he said i am sure i trust severus snape completely page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry breathed deeply for a few moment in an effort to steady himself it did not work well i do not he said a loudly a before he up to something with draco malfoy right now right under your nose and you still we have discussed this harry said dumbledore and now he sounded stern again i have told you my view you are leaving the school tonight and ill bet you have not even considered that snape and malfoy might decide to to what asked dumbledore his eyebrow raised what is it that you suspect them of doing precisely i they are up to something said harry and his hand curled into fist a he said it professor trelawney wa just in the room of requirement trying to hide her sherry bottle and she heard malfoy whooping celebrating he trying to mend something dangerous in there and if you ask me he fixed it at last and you are about to just walk out of school without enough said dumbledore he said it quite calmly and yet harry fell silent at once he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line do you think that i have once left the school unprotected during my absence this year i have not tonight when i leave there will again be additional protection in place please do not suggest that i do not take the safety of my student seriously harry i did not mumbled harry a little abashed but dumbledore cut across him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i do not wish to discus the matter any further harry bit back his retort scared that he had gone too far that he had ruined his chance of accompanying dumbledore but dumbledore went on do you wish to come with me tonight yes said harry at once very well then listen dumbledore drew himself up to his full height i take you with me on one condition that you obey any command i might give you at once and without question of course be sure to understand me harry i mean that you must follow even such order a run hide or go back do i have your word i yes of course if i tell you to hide you will do so yes if i tell you to flee you will obey yes if i tell you to leave me and save yourself you will do a i tell you harry they looked at each other for a moment page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yes sir very good then i wish you to go and fetch your invisibility cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minute time dumbledore turned back to look out of the fiery window the sun wa now a ruby red glare along the horizon harry walked quickly from the office and down the spiral staircase his mind wa oddly clear all of a sudden he knew what to do ron and hermione were sitting together in the common room when he came back what doe he want hermione said at once harry are you okay she added anxiously i am fine said harry shortly racing past them he dashed up the stair and into his dormitory where he flung open his trunk and pulled out the marauder map and a pair of balledup sock then he sped back down the stair and into the common room skidding to a halt where ron and hermione sat looking stunned i have got to be quick harry panted dumbledore think i am getting my invisibility cloak listen quickly he told them where he wa going and why he did not pause either for hermione s gasp of horror or for ron hasty question they could work out the finer detail for themselves later so you see what this mean harry finished at a gallop dumbledore will not be here tonight so malfoys going to have another clear shot at whatever he up to no listen to me he hissed angrily a both ron and hermione showed every sign of interrupting i know it wa malfoy celebrating in the room of page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling requirement here he shoved the marauder map into hermiones hand you have got to watch him and you have got to watch snape too use anyone else who you can rustle up from the da hermione those contact galleon will still work right dumbledore say he put extra protection in the school but if snape s involved hell know what dumbledore s protection is and how to avoid it but he will not be expecting you lot to be on the watch will he harry began hermione her eye huge with fear i have not got time to argue said harry curtly take this a well he thrust the sock into ron hand thanks said ron er why do i need sock you need what is wrapped in them it the felix felicis share it between yourselves and ginny too say goodbye to her for me id better go dumbledore s waiting no said hermione a ron unwrapped the tiny little bottle of golden potion looking awestruck we do not want it you take it who know what you are going to be facing ill be fine ill be with dumbledore said harry i want to know you lot are okay do not look like that hermione ill see you later and he wa off hurrying back through the portrait hole and toward the entrance hall dumbledore wa waiting beside the oaken front door he turned a harry came skidding out onto the page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling topmost stone step panting hard a searing stitch in his side i would like you to wear your cloak please said dumbledore and he waited until harry had thrown it on before saying very good shall we go dumbledore set off at once down the stone step his own traveling cloak barely stirring in the still summer air harry hurried alongside him under the invisibility cloak still panting and sweating rather a lot but what will people think when they see you leaving professor harry asked his mind on malfoy and snape that i am off into hogsmeade for a drink said dumbledore lightly i sometimes offer rosmerta my custom or else visit the hog head or i appear to it is a good a way a any of disguising one true destination they made their way down the drive in the gathering twilight the air wa full of the smell of warm grass lake water and wood smoke from hagrids cabin it wa difficult to believe that they were heading for anything dangerous or frightening professor said harry quietly a the gate at the bottom of the drive came into view will we be apparating yes said dumbledore you can apparate now i believe yes said harry but i have not got a license page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he felt it best to be honest what if he spoiled everything by turning up a hundred mile from where he wa supposed to go no matter said dumbledore i can assist you again they turned out of the gate into the twilit deserted lane to hogsmeade darkness descended fast a they walked and by the time they reached the high street night wa falling in earnest light twinkled from window over shop and a they neared the three broomstick they heard raucous shouting and stay out shouted madam rosmerta forcibly ejecting a grubbylooking wizard oh hello albus you are out late good evening rosmerta good evening forgive me i am off to the hog head no offense but i feel like a quieter atmosphere tonight a minute later they turned the corner into the side street where the hog head sign creaked a little though there wa no breeze in contrast to the three broomstick the pub appeared to be completely empty it will not be necessary for u to enter muttered dumbledore glancing around a long a nobody see u go now place your hand upon my arm harry there is no need to grip too hard i am merely guiding you on the count of three one two three harry turned at once there wa that horrible sensation that he wa being squeezed through a thick rubber tube he could not draw breath every part of him wa being compressed almost past endurance page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and then just when he thought he must suffocate the invisible band seemed to burst open and he wa standing in cool darkness breathing in lungfuls of fresh salty air page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the cave harry could smell salt and hear rushing wave a light chilly breeze ruffled his hair a he looked out at moonlit sea and starstrewn sky he wa standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock water foaming and churning below him he glanced over his shoulder a towering cliff stood behind them a sheer drop black and faceless a few large chunk of rock such a the one upon which harry and dumbledore were standing looked a though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past it wa a bleak harsh view the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand what do you think asked dumbledore he might have been asking harrys opinion on whether it wa a good site for a picnic they brought the kid from the orphanage here asked harry who could not imagine a le cozy spot for a day trip page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling not here precisely said dumbledore there is a village of sort about halfway along the cliff behind u i believe the orphan were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the wave no i think it wa only ever tom riddle and his youthful victim who visited this spot no muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineer and boat can not approach the cliff the water around them are too dangerous i imagine that riddle climbed down magic would have served better than rope and he brought two small child with him probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them i think the journey alone would have done it do not you harry looked up at the cliff again and felt goose bump but his final destination and ours lie a little farther on come dumbledore beckoned harry to the very edge of the rock where a series of jagged niche made foothold leading down to boulder that lay halfsubmerged in water and closer to the cliff it wa a treacherous descent and dumbledore hampered slightly by his withered hand moved slowly the lower rock were slippery with seawater harry could feel fleck of cold salt spray hitting his face lumos said dumbledore a he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face a thousand fleck of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few foot below where he crouched the black wall of rock beside him wa illuminated too you see said dumbledore quietly holding his wand a little higher harry saw a fissure in the cliff into which dark water wa swirling page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you will not object to getting a little wet no said harry then take off your invisibility cloak there is no need for it now and let u take the plunge and with the sudden agility of a much younger man dumbledore slid from the boulder landed in the sea and began to swim with a perfect breaststroke toward the dark slit in the rock face his lit wand held in his teeth harry pulled off his cloak stuffed it into his pocket and followed the water wa icy harrys waterlogged clothes billowed around him and weighed him down taking deep breath that filled his nostril with the tang of salt and seaweed he struck out for the shimmering shrinking light now moving deeper into the cliff the fissure soon opened into a dark tunnel that harry could tell would be filled with water at high tide the slimy wall were barely three foot apart and glimmered like wet tar in the passing light of dumbledore s wand a little way in the passageway curved to the left and harry saw that it extended far into the cliff he continued to swim in dumbledore s wake the tip of his benumbed finger brushing the rough wet rock then he saw dumbledore rising out of the water ahead his silver hair and dark robe gleaming when harry reached the spot he found step that led into a large cave he clambered up them water streaming from his soaking clothes and emerged shivering uncontrollably into the still and freezing air page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore wa standing in the middle of the cave his wand held high a he turned slowly on the spot examining the wall and ceiling yes this is the place said dumbledore how can you tell harry spoke in a whisper it ha known magic said dumbledore simply harry could not tell whether the shiver he wa experiencing were due to his spinedeep coldness or to the same awareness of enchantment he watched a dumbledore continued to revolve on the spot evidently concentrating on thing harry could not see this is merely the antechamber the entrance hall said dumbledore after a moment or two we need to penetrate the inner place now it is lord voldemorts obstacle that stand in our way rather than those nature made dumbledore approached the wall of the cave and caressed it with his blackened fingertip murmuring word in a strange tongue that harry did not understand twice dumbledore walked right around the cave touching a much of the rough rock a he could occasionally pausing running his finger backward and forward over a particular spot until finally he stopped his hand pressed flat against the wall here he said we go on through here the entrance is concealed harry did not ask how dumbledore knew he had never seen a wizard work thing out like this simply by looking and touching but harry had long since page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling learned that bang and smoke were more often the mark of ineptitude than expertise dumbledore stepped back from the cave wall and pointed his wand at the rock for a moment an arched outline appeared there blazing white a though there wa a powerful light behind the crack you have ddone it said harry through chattering teeth but before the word had left his lip the outline had gone leaving the rock a bare and solid a ever dumbledore looked around harry i am so sorry i forgot he said he now pointed his wand at harry and at once harrys clothes were a warm and dry a if they had been hanging in front of a blazing fire thank you said harry gratefully but dumbledore had already turned his attention back to the solid cave wall he did not try any more magic but simply stood there staring at it intently a though something extremely interesting wa written on it harry stayed quite still he did not want to break dumbledores concentration then after two solid minute dumbledore said quietly oh surely not so crude what is it professor i rather think said dumbledore putting his uninjured hand inside his robe and drawing out a short silver knife of the kind harry used to chop potion ingredient that we are required to make payment to pas payment said harry you have got to give the door something page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling yes said dumbledore blood if i am not much mistaken blood i said it wa crude said dumbledore who sounded disdainful even disappointed a though voldemort had fallen short of the standard dumbledore expected the idea a i am sure you will have gathered is that your enemy must weaken him or herself to enter once again lord voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible thing than physical injury yeah but still if you can avoid it said harry who had experienced enough pain not to be keen for more sometimes however it is unavoidable said dumbledore shaking back the sleeve of his robe and exposing the forearm of his injured hand professor protested harry hurrying forward a dumbledore raised his knife ill do it i am he did not know what he wa going to say younger fitter but dumbledore merely smiled there wa a flash of silver and a spurt of scarlet the rock face wa peppered with dark glistening drop you are very kind harry said dumbledore now passing the tip of his wand over the deep cut he had made in his own arm so that it healed instantly just a snape had healed malfoys wound but your blood is worth more than mine ah that seems to have done the trick doe not it the blazing silver outline of an arch had appeared in the wall once more and this time it did not fade away the bloodspattered rock within it simply page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling vanished leaving an opening into what seemed total darkness after me i think said dumbledore and he walked through the archway with harry on his heel lighting his own wand hastily a he went an eerie sight met their eye they were standing on the edge of a great black lake so vast that harry could not make out the distant bank in a cavern so high that the ceiling too wa out of sight a misty greenish light shone far away in what looked like the middle of the lake it wa reflected in the completely still water below the greenish glow and the light from the two wand were the only thing that broke the otherwise velvety blackness though their ray did not penetrate a far a harry would have expected the darkness wa somehow denser than normal darkness let u walk said dumbledore quietly be very careful not to step into the water stay close to me he set off around the edge of the lake and harry followed close behind him their footstep made echoing slapping sound on the narrow rim of rock that surrounded the water on and on they walked but the view did not vary on one side of them the rough cavern wall on the other the boundless expanse of smooth glassy blackness in the very middle of which wa that mysterious greenish glow harry found the place and the silence oppressive unnerving professor he said finally do you think the horcrux is here oh yes said dumbledore yes i am sure it is the question is how do we get to it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling we could not we could not just try a summoning charm harry said sure that it wa a stupid suggestion but he wa much keener than he wa prepared to admit on getting out of this place a soon a possible certainly we could said dumbledore stopping so suddenly that harry almost walked into him why do not you do it me oh okay harry had not expected this but cleared his throat and said loudly wand aloft accio horcruxl with a noise like an explosion something very large and pale erupted out of the dark water some twenty foot away before harry could see what it wa it had vanished again with a crashing splash that made great deep ripple on the mirrored surface harry leapt backward in shock and hit the wall his heart wa still thundering a he turned to dumbledore what wa that something i think that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the horcrux harry looked back at the water the surface of the lake wa once more shining black glass the ripple had vanished unnaturally fast harrys heart however wa still pounding did you think that would happen sir i thought something would happen if we made an obvious attempt to get our hand on the horcrux that wa a very good idea harry much the simplest way of finding out what we are facing page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but we do not know what the thing wa said harry looking at the sinisterly smooth water what the thing are you mean said dumbledore i doubt very much that there is only one of them shall we walk on professor yes harry do you think were going to have to go into the lake into it only if we are very unfortunate you do not think the horcrux is at the bottom oh no i think the horcrux is in the middle and dumbledore pointed toward the misty green light in the center of the lake so were going to have to cross the lake to get to it yes i think so harry did not say anything his thought were all of water monster of giant serpent of demon kelpy and sprite aha said dumbledore and he stopped again this time harry really did walk into him for a moment he toppled on the edge of the dark water and dumbledores uninjured hand closed tightly around his upper arm pulling him back so sorry harry i should have given warning stand back against the wall please i think i have found the place page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry had no idea what dumbledore meant this patch of dark bank wa exactly like every other bit a far a he could tell but dumbledore seemed to have detected something special about it this time he wa running his hand not over the rocky wall but through the thin air a though expecting to find and grip something invisible oho said dumbledore happily second later his hand had closed in midair upon something harry could not see dumbledore moved closer to the water harry watched nervously a the tip of dumbledore s buckled shoe found the utmost edge of the rock rim keeping his hand clenched in midair dumbledore raised his wand with the other and tapped his fist with the point immediately a thick coppery green chain appeared out of thin air extending from the depth of the water into dumbledore s clenched hand dumbledore tapped the chain which began to slide through his fist like a snake coiling itself on the ground with a clinking sound that echoed noisily off the rocky wall pulling something from the depth of the black water harry gasped a the ghostly prow of a tiny boat broke the surface glowing a green a the chain and floated with barely a ripple toward the place on the bank where harry and dumbledore stood how did you know that wa there harry asked in astonishment magic always leaf trace said dumbledore a the boat hit the bank with a gentle bump sometimes very distinctive trace i taught tom riddle i know his style is is this boat safe page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling oh yes i think so voldemort needed to create a mean to cross the lake without attracting the wrath of those creature he had placed within it in case he ever wanted to visit or remove his horcrux so the thing in the water will not do anything to u if we cross in voldemorts boat i think we must resign ourselves to the fact that they will at some point realize we are not lord voldemort thus far however we have done well they have allowed u to raise the boat but why have they let u asked harry who could not shake off the vision of tentacle rising out of the dark water the moment they were out of sight of the bank voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat said dumbledore i think he would have been prepared to risk what wa to his mind the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it knowing that he had set other obstacle ahead that only he would be able to penetrate we shall see whether he is right harry looked down into the boat it really wa very small it doe not look like it wa built for two people will it hold both of u will we be too heavy together dumbledore chuckled voldemort will not have cared about the weight but about the amount of magical power that crossed his lake i rather think an enchantment will have been page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling placed upon this boat so that only one wizard at a time will be able to sail in it but then i do not think you will count harry you are underage and unqualified voldemort would never have expected a sixteenyearold to reach this place i think it unlikely that your power will register compared to mine these word did nothing to raise harrys morale perhaps dumbledore knew it for he added voldemorts mistake harry voldemorts mistake age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimate youth now you first this time and be careful not to touch the water dumbledore stood aside and harry climbed carefully into the boat dumbledore stepped in too coiling the chain onto the floor they were crammed in together harry could not comfortably sit but crouched his knee jutting over the edge of the boat which began to move at once there wa no sound other than the silken rustle of the boat prow cleaving the water it moved without their help a though an invisible rope wa pulling it onward toward the light in the center soon they could no longer see the wall of the cavern they might have been at sea except that there were no wave harry looked down and saw the reflected gold of his wandlight sparkling and glittering on the black water a they passed the boat wa carving deep ripple upon the glassy surface groove in the dark mirror and then harry saw it marble white floating inch below the surface page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling professor he said and his startled voice echoed loudly over the silent water harry i think i saw a hand in the water a human hand yes i am sure you did said dumbledore calmly harry stared down into the water looking for the vanished hand and a sick feeling rose in his throat so that thing that jumped out of the water but harry had his answer before dumbledore could reply the wandlight had slid over a fresh patch of water and showed him this time a dead man lying faceup inch beneath the surface his open eye misted a though with cobweb his hair and his robe swirling around him like smoke there are body in here said harry and his voice sounded much higher than usual and most unlike his own yes said dumbledore placidly but we do not need to worry about them at the moment at the moment harry repeated tearing his gaze from the water to look at dumbledore not while they are merely drifting peacefully below u said dumbledore there is nothing to be feared from a body harry any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness lord voldemort who of course secretly fear both disagrees but once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom it is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness nothing more page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry said nothing he did not want to argue but he found the idea that there were body floating around them and beneath them horrible and what wa more he did not believe that they were not dangerous but one of them jumped he said trying to make his voice a level and calm a dumbledore s when i tried to summon the horcrux a body leapt out of the lake yes said dumbledore i am sure that once we take the horcrux we shall find them le peaceable however like many creature that dwell in cold and darkness they fear light and warmth which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise fire harry dumbledore added with a smile in response to harrys bewildered expression oh right said harry quickly he turned his head to look at the greenish glow toward which the boat wa still inexorably sailing he could not pretend now that he wa not scared the great black lake teeming with the dead it seemed hour and hour ago that he had met professor trelawney that he had given ron and hermione felix felicis he suddenly wished he had said a better goodbye to them and he had not seen ginny at all nearly there said dumbledore cheerfully sure enough the greenish light seemed to be growing larger at last and within minute the boat had come to a halt bumping gently into something that harry could not see at first but when he raised his illuminated wand he saw that they had reached a small island of smooth rock in the center of the lake careful not to touch the water said dumbledore again a harry climbed out of the boat page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the island wa no larger than dumbledore s office an expanse of flat dark stone on which stood nothing but the source of that greenish light which looked much brighter when viewed close to harry squinted at it at first he thought it wa a lamp of some kind but then he saw that the light wa coming from a stone basin rather like the pensieve which wa set on top of a pedestal dumbledore approached the basin and harry followed side by side they looked down into it the basin wa full of an emerald liquid emitting that phosphorescent glow what is it asked harry quietly i am not sure said dumbledore something more worrisome than blood and body however dumbledore pushed back the sleeve of his robe over his blackened hand and stretched out the tip of his burned finger toward the surface of the potion sir no do not touch i can not touch said dumbledore smiling faintly see i can not approach any nearer than this you try staring harry put his hand into the basin and attempted to touch the potion he met an invisible barrier that prevented him coming within an inch of it no matter how hard he pushed his finger encountered nothing but what seemed to be solid and inflexible air out of the way please harry said dumbledore he raised his wand and made complicated movement over the surface of the potion murmuring page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling soundlessly nothing happened except perhaps that the potion glowed a little brighter harry remained silent while dumbledore worked but after a while dumbledore withdrew his wand and harry felt it wa safe to talk again you think the horcrux is in there sir oh yes dumbledore peered more closely into the basin harry saw his face reflected upside down in the smooth surface of the green potion but how to reach it this potion can not be penetrated by hand vanished parted scooped up or siphoned away nor can it be transfigured charmed or otherwise made to change it nature almost absentmindedly dumbledore raised his wand again twirled it once in midair and then caught the crystal goblet that he had conjured out of nowhere i can only conclude that this potion is supposed to be drunk what said harry no yes i think so only by drinking it can i empty the basin and see what lie in it depth but what if what if it kill you oh i doubt that it would work like that said dumbledore easily lord voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island harry could not believe it wa this more of dumbledore s insane determination to see good in everyone page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling sir said harry trying to keep his voice reasonable sir this is voldemort were i am sorry harry i should have said he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island dumbledore corrected himself he would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defense and most importantly of all why they were so intent upon emptying the basin do not forget that lord voldemort belief that he alone know about his horcruxes harry made to speak again but this time dumbledore raised his hand for silence frowning slightly at the emerald liquid evidently thinking hard undoubtedly he said finally this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the horcrux it might paralyze me because me to forget what i am here for create so much pain i am distracted or render me incapable in some other way this being the case harry it will be your job to make sure i keep drinking even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth you understand their eye met over the basin each pale face lit with that strange green light harry did not speak wa this why he had been invited along so that he could forcefeed dumbledore a potion that might cause him unendurable pain you remember said dumbledore the condition on which i brought you with me harry hesitated looking into the blue eye that had turned green in the reflected light of the basin but what if page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you swore did you not to follow any command i gave you yes but i warned you did i not that there might be danger yes said harry but well then said dumbledore shaking back his sleeve once more and raising the empty goblet you have my order why can not i drink the potion instead asked harry desperately because i am much older much cleverer and much le valuable said dumbledore once and for all harry do i have your word that you will do all in your power to make me keep drinking could not do i have it but your word harry i all right but before harry could make any further protest dumbledore lowered the crystal goblet into the potion for a split second harry hoped that he would not be able to touch the potion with the goblet but the crystal sank into the surface a nothing else had when the glass wa full to the brim dumbledore lifted it to his mouth page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling your good health harry and he drained the goblet harry watched terrified his hand gripping the rim of the basin so hard that his fingertip were numb professor he said anxiously a dumbledore lowered the empty glass how do you feel dumbledore shook his head his eye closed harry wondered whether he wa in pain dumbledore plunged the glass blindly back into the basin refilled it and drank once more in silence dumbledore drank three gobletsful of the potion then halfway through the fourth goblet he staggered and fell forward against the basin his eye were still closed his breathing heavy professor dumbledore said harry his voice strained can you hear me dumbledore did not answer his face wa twitching a though he wa deeply asleep but dreaming a horrible dream his grip on the goblet wa slackening the potion wa about to spill from it harry reached forward and grasped the crystal cup holding it steady professor can you hear me he repeated loudly his voice echoing around the cavern dumbledore panted and then spoke in a voice harry did not recognize for he had never heard dumbledore frightened like this i do not want do not make me page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry stared into the whitened face he knew so well at the crooked nose and halfmoon spectacle and did not know what to do do not like want to stop moaned dumbledore you you can not stop professor said harry you have got to keep drinking remember you told me you had to keep drinking here hating himself repulsed by what he wa doing harry forced the goblet back toward dumbledore s mouth and tipped it so that dumbledore drank the remainder of the potion inside no he groaned a harry lowered the goblet back into the basin and refilled it for him i do not want to i do not want to let me go it all right professor said harry his hand shaking it all right i am here make it stop make it stop moaned dumbledore yes yes this will make it stop lied harry he tipped the content of the goblet into dumbledore s open mouth dumbledore screamed the noise echoed all around the vast chamber across the dead black water no no no no i can not i can not do not make me i do not want to it all right professor it all right said harry loudly his hand shaking so badly he could hardly scoop up the sixth gobletful of potion the basin wa now half empty nothing happening to you you are page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling safe it is not real i swear it is not real take this now take this and obediently dumbledore drank a though it wa an antidote harry offered him but upon draining the goblet he sank to his knee shaking uncontrollably it all my fault all my fault he sobbed please make it stop i know i did wrong oh please make it stop and ill never never again this will make it stop professor harry said his voice cracking a he tipped the seventh glass of potion into dumbledores mouth dumbledore began to cower a though invisible torturer surrounded him his flailing hand almost knocked the refilled goblet from harrys trembling hand a he moaned do not hurt them do not hurt them please please it my fault hurt me instead here drink this drink this you will be all right said harry desperately and once again dumbledore obeyed him opening his mouth even a he kept his eye tight shut and shook from head to foot and now he fell forward screaming again hammering his fist upon the ground while harry filled the ninth goblet please please please no not that not that ill do anything just drink professor just drink dumbledore drank like a child dying of thirst but when he had finished he yelled again a though his inside were on fire no more please no more page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry scooped up a tenth gobletful of potion and felt the crystal scrape the bottom of the basin were nearly there professor drink this drink it he supported dumbledores shoulder and again dumbledore drained the glass then harry wa on his foot once more refilling the goblet a dumbledore began to scream in more anguish than ever i want to die i want to die make it stop make it stop i want to die drink this professor drink this dumbledore drank and no sooner had he finished than he yelled kill me this this one will gasped harry just drink this it will be over all over dumbledore gulped at the goblet drained every last drop and then with a great rattling gasp rolled over onto his face no shouted harry who had stood to refill the goblet again instead he dropped the cup into the basin flung himself down beside dumbledore and heaved him over onto his back dumbledores glass were askew his mouth agape his eye closed no said harry shaking dumbledore no you are not dead you said it wa not poison wake up wake up rennervatel he cried his wand pointing at dumbledores chest there wa a flash of red light but nothing happened renneruate sir please dumbledores eyelid flickered harrys heart leapt sir are you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling water croaked dumbledore water panted harry yes he leapt to his foot and seized the goblet he had dropped in the basin he barely registered the golden locket lying curled beneath it aguamenti he shouted jabbing the goblet with his wand the goblet filled with clear water harry dropped to his knee beside dumbledore raised his head and brought the glass to his lip but it wa empty dumbledore groaned and began to pant but i had some wait aguamentiv said harry again pointing his wand at the goblet once more for a second clear water gleamed within it but a he approached dumbledore s mouth the water vanished again sir i am trying i am trying said harry desperately but he did not think that dumbledore could hear him he had rolled onto his side and wa drawing great rattling breath that sounded agonizing aguamenti aguamenti a guamentp the goblet filled and emptied once more and now dumbledore s breathing wa fading his brain whirling in panic harry knew instinctively the only way left to get water because voldemort had planned it so he flung himself over to the edge of the rock and plunged the goblet into the lake bringing it up full to the brim of icy water that did not vanish page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling sir here harry yelled and lunging forward he tipped the water clumsily over dumbledores face it wa the best he could do for the icy feeling on his arm not holding the cup wa not the lingering chill of the water a slimy white hand had gripped his wrist and the creature to whom it belonged wa pulling him slowly backward across the rock the surface of the lake wa no longer mirrorsmooth it wa churning and everywhere harry looked white head and hand were emerging from the dark water men and woman and child with sunken sightless eye were moving toward the rock an army of the dead rising from the black water petrificus totalusl yelled harry struggling to cling to the smooth soaked surface of the island a he pointed his wand at the inferius that had his arm it released him falling backward into the water with a splash he scrambled to his foot but many more inferi were already climbing onto the rock their bony hand clawing at it slippery surface their blank frosted eye upon him trailing waterlogged rag sunken face leering petrificus totalusl harry bellowed again backing away a he swiped his wand through the air six or seven of them crumpled but more were coming toward him impedimental incarcerousl a few of them stumbled one or two of them bound in rope but those climbing onto the rock behind them merely stepped over or on the fallen body still slashing at the air with his wand harry yelled sectumsempral sectumsempral but though gash appeared in their sodden rag and their icy skin they had no blood to spill they walked on unfeeling their shrunken hand outstretched page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling toward him and a he backed away still farther he felt arm enclose him from behind thin fleshless arm cold a death and his foot left the ground a they lifted him and began to carry him slowly and surely back to the water and he knew there would be no release that he would be drowned and become one more dead guardian of a fragment of voldemorts shattered soul but then through the darkness fire erupted crimson and gold a ring of fire that surrounded the rock so that the inferi holding harry so tightly stumbled and faltered they did not dare pas through the flame to get to the water they dropped harry he hit the ground slipped on the rock and fell grazing his arm but scrambled back up raising his wand and staring around dumbledore wa on his foot again pale a any of the surrounding inferi but taller than any too the fire dancing in his eye his wand wa raised like a torch and from it tip emanated the flame like a vast lasso encircling them all with warmth the inferi bumped into each other attempting blindly to escape the fire in which they were enclosed dumbledore scooped the locket from the bottom of the stone basin and stowed it inside his robe wordlessly he gestured to harry to come to his side distracted by the flame the inferi seemed unaware that their quarry wa leaving a dumbledore led harry back to the boat the ring of fire moving with them around them the bewildered inferi accompanying them to the water edge where they slipped gratefully back into their dark water page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry who wa shaking all over thought for a moment that dumbledore might not be able to climb into the boat he staggered a little a he attempted it all his effort seemed to be going into maintaining the ring of protective flame around them harry seized him and helped him back to his seat once they were both safely jammed inside again the boat began to move back across the black water away from the rock still encircled by that ring of fire and it seemed that the inferi swarming below them did not dare resurface sir panted harry sir i forgot about fire they were coming at me and i panicked quite understandable murmured dumbledore harry wa alarmed to hear how faint his voice wa they reached the bank with a little bump and harry leapt out then turned quickly to help dumbledore the moment that dumbledore reached the bank he let his wand hand fall the ring of fire vanished but the inferi did not emerge again from the water the little boat sank into the water once more clanking and tinkling it chain slithered back into the lake too dumbledore gave a great sigh and leaned against the cavern wall i am weak he said do not worry sir said harry at once anxious about dumbledore s extreme pallor and by his air of exhaustion do not worry ill get u back lean on me sir and pulling dumbledore s uninjured arm around his shoulder harry guided his headmaster back around the lake bearing most of his weight page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the protection wa after all welldesigned said dumbledore faintly one alone could not have done it you did well very well harry do not talk now said harry fearing how slurred dumbledores voice had become how much his foot dragged save your energy sir well soon be out of here the archway will have sealed again my knife there is no need i got cut on the rock said harry firmly just tell me where here harry wiped his grazed forearm upon the stone having received it tribute of blood the archway reopened instantly they crossed the outer cave and harry helped dumbledore back into the icy seawater that filled the crevice in the cliff it going to be all right sir harry said over and over again more worried by dumbledores silence than he had been by his weakened voice were nearly there i can apparate u both back do not worry i am not worried harry said dumbledore his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water i am with you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the lightningstruck tower once back under the starry sky harry heaved dumbledore onto the top of the nearest boulder and then to his foot sodden and shivering dumbledores weight still upon him harry concentrated harder than he had ever done upon his destination hogsmeade closing his eye gripping dumbledores arm a tightly a he could he stepped forward into that feeling of horrible compression he knew it had worked before he opened his eye the smell of salt the sea breeze had gone he and dumbledore were shivering and dripping in the middle of the dark high street in hogsmeade for one horrible moment harrys imagination showed him more inferi creeping toward him around the side of shop but he blinked and saw that nothing wa stirring all wa still the darkness complete but for a few streetlamps and lit upper window page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling we did it professor harry whispered with difficulty he suddenly realized that he had a searing stitch in his chest we did it we got the horcrux dumbledore staggered against him for a moment harry thought that his inexpert apparition had thrown dumbledore off balance then he saw his face paler and damper than ever in the distant light of a streetlamp sir are you all right i have been better said dumbledore weakly though the corner of his mouth twitched that potion wa no health drink and to harrys horror dumbledore sank onto the ground sir it okay sir you are going to be all right do not worry he looked around desperately for help but there wa nobody to be seen and all he could think wa that he must somehow get dumbledore quickly to the hospital wing we need to get you up to the school sir madam pomfrey no said dumbledore it is professor snape whom i need but i do not think i can walk very far just yet right sir listen i am going to knock on a door find a place you can stay then i can run and get madam page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling severus said dumbledore clearly i need severus all right then snape but i am going to have to leave you for a moment so i can before harry could make a move however he heard running footstep his heart leapt somebody had seen somebody knew they needed help and looking around he saw madam rosmerta scurrying down the dark street toward them on highheeled fluffy slipper wearing a silk dressing gown embroidered with dragon i saw you apparate a i wa pulling my bedroom curtain thank goodness thank goodness i could not think what to but what is wrong with albus she came to a halt panting and stared down wide eyed at dumbledore he hurt said harry madam rosmerta can he come into the three broomstick while i go up to the school and get help for him you can not go up there alone do not you realize have not you seen if you help me support him said harry not listening to her i think we can get him inside what ha happened asked dumbledore rosmerta what is wrong the the dark mark albus and she pointed into the sky in the direction of hogwarts dread flooded harry at the sound of the word he turned and looked page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling there it wa hanging in the sky above the school the blazing green skull with a serpent tongue the mark death eater left behind whenever they had entered a building wherever they had murdered when did it appear asked dumbledore and his hand clenched painfully upon harrys shoulder a he struggled to his foot must have been minute ago it wa not there when i put the cat out but when i got upstairs we need to return to the castle at once said dumbledore rosmerta and though he staggered a little he seemed wholly in command of the situation we need transport broom i have got a couple behind the bar she said looking very frightened shall i run and fetch no harry can do it harry raised his wand at once accio rosmertas broomsl a second later they heard a loud bang a the front door of the pub burst open two broom had shot out into the street and were racing each other to harrys side where they stopped dead quivering slightly at waist height rosmerta please send a message to the ministry said dumbledore a he mounted the broom nearest him it might be that nobody within hogwarts ha yet realized anything is wrong harry put on your invisibility cloak page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry pulled his cloak out of his pocket and threw it over himself before mounting his broom madam rosmerta wa already tottering back toward her pub a harry and dumbledore kicked off from the ground and rose up into the air a they sped toward the castle harry glanced sideways at dumbledore ready to grab him should he fall but the sight of the dark mark seemed to have acted upon dumbledore like a stimulant he wa bent low over his broom his eye fixed upon the mark his long silver hair and beard flying behind him on the night air and harry too looked ahead at the skull and fear swelled inside him like a venomous bubble compressing his lung driving all other discomfort from his mind how long had they been away had ron hermione and ginnys luck run out by now wa it one of them who had caused the mark to be set over the school or wa it neville or luna or some other member of the da and if it wa he wa the one who had told them to patrol the corridor he had asked them to leave the safety of their bed would he be responsible again for the death of a friend a they flew over the dark twisting lane down which they had walked earlier harry heard over the whistling of the night air in his ear dumbledore muttering in some strange language again he thought he understood why a he felt his broom shudder when they flew over the boundary wall into the ground dumbledore wa undoing the enchantment he himself had set around the castle so they could enter at speed the dark mark wa glittering directly above the astronomy tower the highest of the castle did that mean the death had occurred there page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore had already crossed the crenellated rampart and wa dismounting harry landed next to him second later and looked around the rampart were deserted the door to the spiral staircase that led back into the castle wa closed there wa no sign of a struggle of a fight to the death of a body what doe it mean harry asked dumbledore looking up at the green skull with it serpent tongue glinting evilly above them is it the real mark ha someone definitely been professor in the dim green glow from the mark harry saw dumbledore clutching at his chest with his blackened hand go and wake severus said dumbledore faintly but clearly tell him what ha happened and bring him to me do nothing else speak to nobody else and do not remove your cloak i shall wait here but you swore to obey me harry go harry hurried over to the door leading to the spiral staircase but his hand had only just closed upon the iron ring of the door when he heard running footstep on the other side he looked around at dumbledore who gestured him to retreat harry backed away drawing his wand a he did so the door burst open and somebody erupted through it and shouted expelliarmus harrys body became instantly rigid and immobile and he felt himself fall back against the tower wall page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling propped like an unsteady statue unable to move or speak he could not understand how it had happened expelliarmus wa not a freezing charm then by the light of the mark he saw dumbledore s wand flying in an arc over the edge of the rampart and understood dumbledore had wordlessly immobilized harry and the second he had taken to perform the spell had cost him the chance of defending himself standing against the rampart very white in the face dumbledore still showed no sign of panic or distress he merely looked across at his disarmer and said good evening draco malfoy stepped forward glancing around quickly to check that he and dumbledore were alone his eye fell upon the second broom who else is here a question i might ask you or are you acting alone harry saw malfoys pale eye shift back to dumbledore in the greenish glare of the mark no he said i have got backup there are death eater here in your school tonight well well said dumbledore a though malfoy wa showing him an ambitious homework project very good indeed you found a way to let them in did you yeah said malfoy who wa panting right under your nose and you never realized page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling ingenious said dumbledore yet forgive me where are they now you seem unsupported they met some of your guard they are having a fight down below they will not be long i came on ahead i i have got a job to do well then you must get on and do it my dear boy said dumbledore softly there wa silence harry stood imprisoned within his own invisible paralyzed body staring at the two of them his ear straining to hear sound of the death eater distant fight and in front of him draco malfoy did nothing but stare at albus dumbledore who incredibly smiled draco draco you are not a killer how do you know said malfoy at once he seemed to realize how childish the word had sounded harry saw him flush in the mark greenish light you do not know what i am capable of said malfoy more forcefully you do not know what i have done oh yes i do said dumbledore mildly you almost killed katie bell and ronald weasley you have been trying with increasing desperation to kill me all year forgive me draco but they have been feeble attempt so feeble to be honest that i wonder whether your heart ha been really in it it ha been in it said malfoy vehemently i have been working on it all year and tonight page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling somewhere in the depth of the castle below harry heard a muffled yell malfoy stiffened and glanced over his shoulder somebody is putting up a good fight said dumbledore conversationally but you were saying yes you have managed to introduce death eater into my school which i admit i thought impossible how did you do it but malfoy said nothing he wa still listening to whatever wa happening below and seemed almost a paralyzed a harry wa perhaps you ought to get on with the job alone suggested dumbledore what if your backup ha been thwarted by my guard a you have perhaps realized there are member of the order of the phoenix here tonight too and after all you do not really need help i have no wand at the moment i can not defend myself malfoy merely stared at him i see said dumbledore kindly when malfoy neither moved nor spoke you are afraid to act until they join you i am not afraid snarled malfoy though he still made no move to hurt dumbledore it you who should be scared but why i do not think you will kill me draco killing is not nearly a easy a the innocent believe so tell me while we wait for your friend how did you smuggle them in here it seems to have taken you a long time to work out how to do it page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling malfoy looked a though he wa fighting down the urge to shout or to vomit he gulped and took several deep breath glaring at dumbledore his wand pointing directly at the latter heart then a though he could not help himself he said i had to mend that broken vanishing cabinet that no one used for year the one montague got lost in last year aaaah dumbledores sigh wa half a groan he closed his eye for a moment that wa clever there is a pair i take it in borgin and burke said malfoy and they make a kind of passage between them montague told me that when he wa stuck in the hogwarts one he wa trapped in limbo but sometimes he could hear what wa going on at school and sometimes what wa going on in the shop a if the cabinet wa traveling between them but he could not make anyone hear him in the end he managed to apparate out even though he would never passed his test he nearly died doing it everyone thought it wa a really good story but i wa the only one who realized what it meant even borgin did not know i wa the one who realized there could be a way into hogwarts through the cabinet if i fixed the broken one very good murmured dumbledore so the death eater were able to pas from borgin and burke into the school to help you a clever plan a very clever plan and a you say right under my nose yeah said malfoy who bizarrely seemed to draw courage and comfort from dumbledores praise yeah it wa but there were time dumbledore went on were not there when you were not sure you would succeed in mending the cabinet and you resorted to crude and page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling badly judged measure such a sending me a cursed necklace that wa bound to reach the wrong hand poisoning mead there wa only the slightest chance i might drink yeah well you still did not realize who wa behind that stuff did you sneered malfoy a dumbledore slid a little down the rampart the strength in his leg apparently fading and harry struggled fruitlessly mutely against the enchantment binding him a a matter of fact i did said dumbledore i wa sure it wa you why did not you stop me then malfoy demanded i tried draco professor snape ha been keeping watch over you on my order he ha not been doing your order he promised my mother of course that is what he would tell you draco but he a double agent you stupid old man he is not working for you you just think he is we must agree to differ on that draco it so happens that i trust professor snape well you are losing your grip then sneered malfoy he been offering me plenty of help wanting all the glory for himself wanting a bit of the action what are you doing did you do the necklace that wa stupid it could have blown everything but i have not told him what i have been doing in the room of requirement he going to wake up tomorrow and it will page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling all be over and he will not be the dark lord favorite anymore hell be nothing compared to me nothing very gratifying said dumbledore mildly we all like appreciation for our own hard work of course but you must have had an accomplice all the same someone in hogsmeade someone who wa able to slip katie the the aaaah dumbledore closed his eye again and nodded a though he wa about to fall asleep of course rosmerta how long ha she been under the imperius curse got there at last have you malfoy taunted there wa another yell from below rather louder than the last malfoy looked nervously over his shoulder again then back at dumbledore who went on so poor rosmerta wa forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pas that necklace to any hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied and the poisoned mead well naturally rosmerta wa able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to slughorn believing that it wa to be my christmas present yes very neat very neat poor mr filch would not of course think to check a bottle of rosmertas tell me how have you been communicating with rosmerta i thought we had all method of communication in and out of the school monitored enchanted coin said malfoy a though he wa compelled to keep talking though his wand hand wa shaking badly i had one and she had the other and i could send her message is not that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves dumbledore s army page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling used last year asked dumbledore his voice wa light and conversational but harry saw him slip an inch lower down the wall a he said it yeah i got the idea from them said malfoy with a twisted smile i got the idea of poisoning the mead from the mudblood granger a well i heard her talking in the library about filch not recognizing potion please do not use that offensive word in front of me said dumbledore malfoy gave a harsh laugh you care about me saying mudblood when i am about to kill you yes i do said dumbledore and harry saw his foot slide a little on the floor a he struggled to remain upright but a for being about to kill me draco you have had several long minute now we are quite alone i am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me and still you have not acted malfoys mouth contorted involuntarily a though he had tasted something very bitter now about tonight dumbledore went on i am a little puzzled about how it happened you knew that i had left the school but of course he answered his own question rosmerta saw me leaving she tipped you off using your ingenious coin i am sure that is right said malfoy but she said you were just going for a drink you would be back page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well i certainly did have a drink and i came back after a fashion mumbled dumbledore so you decided to spring a trap for me we decided to put the dark mark over the tower and get you to hurry up here to see who would been killed said malfoy and it worked well yes and no said dumbledore but am i to take it then that nobody ha been murdered someone is dead said malfoy and his voice seemed to go up an octave a he said it one of your people i do not know who it wa dark i stepped over the body i wa supposed to be waiting up here when you got back only your phoenix lot got in the way yes they do that said dumbledore there wa a bang and shout from below louder than ever it sounded a though people were fighting on the actual spiral staircase that led to where dumbledore malfoy and harry stood and harrys heart thundered unheard in his invisible chest someone wa dead malfoy had stepped over the body but who wa it there is little time one way or another said dumbledore so let u discus your option draco my option said malfoy loudly i am standing here with a wand i am about to kill you my dear boy let u have no more pretense about that if you were going to kill me you would have done it when you first disarmed me you would not have stopped for this pleasant chat about way and mean page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i have not got any option said malfoy and he wa suddenly white a dumbledore i have got to do it hell kill me hell kill my whole family i appreciate the difficulty of your position said dumbledore why else do you think i have not confronted you before now because i knew that you would have been murdered if lord voldemort realized that i suspected you malfoy winced at the sound of the name i did not dare speak to you of the mission with which i knew you had been entrusted in case he used legilimency against you continued dumbledore but now at last we can speak plainly to each other no harm ha been done you have hurt nobody though you are very lucky that your unintentional victim survived i can help you draco no you can not said malfoy his wand hand shaking very badly indeed nobody can he told me to do it or hell kill me i have got no choice come over to the right side draco and we can hide you more completely than you can possibly imagine what is more i can send member of the order to your mother tonight to hide her likewise your father is safe at the moment in azkaban when the time come we can protect him too come over to the right side draco you are not a killer malfoy stared at dumbledore but i got this far did not i he said slowly they thought id die in the attempt but i am here and you are in my power i am the one with the wand you are at my mercy page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no draco said dumbledore quietly it is my mercy and not yours that matter now malfoy did not speak his mouth wa open his wand hand still trembling harry thought he saw it drop by a fraction but suddenly footstep were thundering up the stair and a second later malfoy wa buffeted out of the way a four people in black robe burst through the door onto the rampart still paralyzed his eye staring unblinkingly harry gazed in terror upon four stranger it seemed the death eater had won the fight below a lumpylooking man with an odd lopsided leer gave a wheezy giggle dumbledore cornered he said and he turned to a stocky little woman who looked a though she could be his sister and who wa grinning eagerly dumbledore wandless dumbledore alone well done draco well done good evening amycus said dumbledore calmly a though welcoming the man to a tea party and you have brought alecto too charming the woman gave an angry little titter think your little jokesll help you on your deathbed then she jeered joke no no these are manner replied dumbledore do it said the stranger standing nearest to harry a big rangy man with matted gray hair and whisker whose black death eater robe looked uncomfortably tight he had a voice like none that page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry had ever heard a rasping bark of a voice harry could smell a powerful mixture of dirt sweat and unmistakably of blood coming from him his filthy hand had long yellowish nail is that you fenrir asked dumbledore that is right rasped the other pleased to see me dumbledore no i can not say that i am greyback grinned showing pointed teeth blood trickled down his chin and he licked his lip slowly obscenely but you know how much i like kid dumbledore am i to take it that you are attacking even without the full moon now this is most unusual you have developed a taste for human flesh that can not be satisfied once a month that is right said fenrir greyback shock you that doe it dumbledore frightens you well i can not pretend it doe not disgust me a little said dumbledore and yes i am a little shocked that draco here invited you of all people into the school where his friend live i did not breathed malfoy he wa not looking at fenrir he did not seem to want to even glance at him i did not know he wa going to come i would not want to miss a trip to hogwarts dumbledore rasped greyback not when there are throat to be ripped out delicious delicious page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and he raised a yellow fingernail and picked at his front teeth leering at dumbledore i could do you for afters dumbledore no said the fourth death eater sharply he had a heavy brutallooking face we have got order draco got to do it now draco and quickly malfoy wa showing le resolution than ever he looked terrified a he stared into dumbledore s face which wa even paler and rather lower than usual a he had slid so far down the rampart wall he not long for this world anyway if you ask me said the lopsided man to the accompaniment of his sister wheezing giggle look at him what is happened to you then dumby oh weaker resistance slower reflex amycus said dumbledore old age in short one day perhaps it will happen to you if you are lucky what is that mean then what is that mean yelled the death eater suddenly violent always the same were not yeh dumby talking and doing nothing nothing i do not even know why the dark lord bothering to kill yer come on draco do it but at that moment there were renewed sound of scuffling from below and a voice shouted they have blocked the stair reductol reductol harrys heart leapt so these four had not eliminated all opposition but merely broken through the fight to the top of the tower and by the sound of it created a barrier behind them now draco quickly said the brutalfaced man angrily page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but malfoys hand wa shaking so badly that he could barely aim ill do it snarled fenrir moving toward dumbledore with his hand outstretched his teeth bared i said no shouted the brutalfaced man there wa a flash of light and the werewolf wa blasted out of the way he hit the rampart and staggered looking furious harrys heart wa hammering so hard it seemed impossible that nobody could hear him standing there imprisoned by dumbledore s spell if he could only move he could aim a curse from under the cloak draco do it or stand aside so one of u screeched the woman but at that precise moment the door to the rampart burst open once more and there stood snape his wand clutched in his hand a his black eye swept the scene from dumbledore slumped against the wall to the four death eater including the enraged werewolf and malfoy we have got a problem snape said the lumpy amycus whose eye and wand were fixed alike upon dumbledore the boy doe not seem able but somebody else had spoken snapes name quite softly severus the sound frightened harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening for the first time dumbledore wa pleading snape said nothing but walked forward and pushed malfoy roughly out of the way the three death eater page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling fell back without a word even the werewolf seemed cowed snape gazed for a moment at dumbledore and there wa revulsion and hatred etched in the harsh line of his face severus please snape raised his wand and pointed it directly at dumbledore avada kedavrav a jet of green light shot from the end of snapes wand and hit dumbledore squarely in the chest harrys scream of horror never left him silent and unmoving he wa forced to watch a dumbledore wa blasted into the air for a split second he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull and then he fell slowly backward like a great rag doll over the battlement and out of sight page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling flight of the prince harry felt a though he too were hurtling through space it had not happened it could not have happened out of here quickly said snape he seized malfoy by the scruff of the neck and forced him through the door ahead of the rest greyback and the squat brother and sister followed the latter both panting excitedly a they vanished through the door harry realized he could move again what wa now holding him paralyzed against the wall wa not magic but horror and shock he threw the invisibility cloak aside a the brutalfaced death eater last to leave the tower top wa disappearing through the door petrificus totalusl the death eater buckled a though hit in the back with something solid and fell to the ground rigid a a waxwork but he had barely hit the floor when harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling wa clambering over him and running down the darkened staircase terror tore at harrys heart he had to get to dumbledore and he had to catch snape somehow the two thing were linked he could reverse what had happened if he had them both together dumbledore could not have died he leapt the last ten step of the spiral staircase and stopped where he landed his wand raised the dimly lit corridor wa full of dust half the ceiling seemed to have fallen in and a battle wa raging before him but even a he attempted to make out who wa fighting whom he heard the hated voice shout it over time to go and saw snape disappearing around the corner at the far end of the corridor he and malfoy seemed to have forced their way through the fight unscathed a harry plunged after them one of the fighter detached themselves from the fray and flew at him it wa the werewolf fenrir he wa on top of harry before harry could raise his wand harry fell backward with filthy matted hair in his face the stench of sweat and blood filling his nose and mouth hot greedy breath at his throat petrificus totalusl harry felt fenrir collapse against him with a stupendous effort he pushed the werewolf off and onto the floor a a jet of green light came flying toward him he ducked and ran headfirst into the fight his foot met something squashy and slippery on the floor and he stumbled there were two body lying there lying facedown in a pool of blood but there wa no time to investigate harry now saw red hair flying like flame in front of him ginny wa locked in combat with the lumpy death eater amycus who wa throwing hex after hex at her while page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she dodged them amycus wa giggling enjoying the sport crucio crucio you can not dance forever pretty impedimenta yelled harry his jinx hit amycus in the chest he gave a piglike squeal of pain wa lifted off his foot and slammed into the opposite wall slid down it and fell out of sight behind ron professor mcgonagall and lupin each of whom wa battling a separate death eater beyond them harry saw tonks fighting an enormous blond wizard who wa sending curse flying in all direction so that they ricocheted off the wall around them cracking stone shattering the nearest window harry where did you come from ginny cried but there wa no time to answer her he put his head down and sprinted forward narrowly avoiding a blast that erupted over his head showering them all in bit of wall snape must not escape he must catch up with snape take that shouted professor mcgonagall and harry glimpsed the female death eater alecto sprinting away down the corridor with her arm over her head her brother right behind her he launched himself after them but his foot caught on something and next moment he wa lying across someone is leg looking around he saw nevilles pale round face flat against the floor neville are you mall right muttered neville who wa clutching his stomach harry snape n malfoy ran past page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i know i am on it said harry aiming a hex from the floor at the enormous blond death eater who wa causing most of the chaos the man gave a howl of pain a the spell hit him in the face he wheeled around staggered and then pounded away after the brother and sister harry scrambled up from the floor and began to sprint along the corridor ignoring the bang issuing from behind him the yell of the others to come back and the mute call of the figure on the ground whose fate he did not yet know he skidded around the corner his trainer slippery with blood snape had an immense head start wa it possible that he had already entered the cabinet in the room of requirement or had the order made step to secure it to prevent the death eater retreating that way he could hear nothing but his own pounding foot his own hammering heart a he sprinted along the next empty corridor but then spotted a bloody footprint that showed at least one of the fleeing death eater wa heading toward the front door perhaps the room of requirement wa indeed blocked he skidded around another corner and a curse flew past him he dived behind a suit of armor that exploded he saw the brother and sister running down the marble staircase ahead and aimed jinx at them but merely hit several bewigged witch in a portrait on the landing who ran screeching into neighboring painting a he leapt the wreckage of armor harry heard more shout and scream other people within the castle seemed to have awoken he pelted toward a shortcut hoping to overtake the brother and sister and close in on snape and malfoy who must surely have reached the ground by now remembering to leap the vanishing step halfway down the concealed staircase he burst through a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tapestry at the bottom and out into a corridor where a number of bewildered and pajamaclad hufflepuffs stood harry we heard a noise and someone said something about the dark mark began ernie macmillan out of the way yelled harry knocking two boy aside a he sprinted toward the landing and down the remainder of the marble staircase the oak front door had been blasted open there were smear of blood on the flagstone and several terrified student stood huddled against the wall one or two still cowering with their arm over their face the giant gryffindor hourglass had been hit by a curse and the ruby within were still falling with a loud rattle onto the flagstone below harry flew across the entrance hall and out into the dark ground he could just make out three figure racing across the lawn heading for the gate beyond which they could disapparate by the look of them the huge blond death eater and some way ahead of him snape and malfoy the cold night air ripped at harrys lung a he tore after them he saw a flash of light in the distance that momentarily silhouetted his quarry he did not know what it wa but continued to run not yet near enough to get a good aim with a curse another flash shout retaliatory jet of light and harry understood hagrid had emerged from his cabin and wa trying to stop the death eater escaping and though every breath seemed to shred his lung and the stitch in his chest wa like fire harry sped up a an unbidden voice in his head said not hagrid not hagrid too page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling something caught harry hard in the small of the back and he fell forward his face smacking the ground blood pouring out of both nostril he knew even a he rolled over his wand ready that the brother and sister he had overtaken using his shortcut were closing in behind him impedimenta he yelled a he rolled over again crouching close to the dark ground and miraculously his jinx hit one of them who stumbled and fell tripping up the other harry leapt to his foot and sprinted on after snape and now he saw the vast outline of hagrid illuminated by the light of the crescent moon revealed suddenly behind cloud the blond death eater wa aiming curse after curse at the gamekeeper but hagrids immense strength and the toughened skin he had inherited from his giantess mother seemed to be protecting him snape and malfoy however were still running they would soon be beyond the gate able to disapparate harry tore past hagrid and his opponent took aim at snapes back and yelled stupefy he missed the jet of red light soared past snapes head snape shouted run draco and turned twenty yard apart he and harry looked at each other before raising their wand simultaneously cruc but snape parried the curse knocking harry backward off his foot before he could complete it harry rolled over and scrambled back up again a the huge death eater behind him yelled incendiol harry heard an explosive bang and a dancing orange light spilled over all of them hagrids house wa on fire page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling fang in there yer evil hagrid bellowed cruc yelled harry for the second time aiming for the figure ahead illuminated in the dancing firelight but snape blocked the spell again harry could see him sneering no unforgivable curse from you potter he shouted over the rushing of the flame hagrids yell and the wild yelping of the trapped fang you have not got the nerve or the ability incarc harry roared but snape deflected the spell with an almost lazy flick of his arm fight back harry screamed at him fight back you cowardly coward did you call me potter shouted snape your father would never attack me unless it wa four on one what would you call him i wonder stupe blocked again and again and again until you learn to keep your mouth shut and your mind closed potter sneered snape deflecting the curse once more now come he shouted at the huge death eater behind harry it is time to be gone before the ministry turn up impedi but before he could finish this jinx excruciating pain hit harry he keeled over in the grass someone wa screaming he would surely die of this agony snape wa going to torture him to death or madness page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling no roared snapes voice and the pain stopped a suddenly a it had started harry lay curled on the dark grass clutching his wand and panting somewhere overhead snape wa shouting have you forgotten our order potter belongs to the dark lord we are to leave him go go and harry felt the ground shudder under his face a the brother and sister and the enormous death eater obeyed running toward the gate harry uttered an inarticulate yell of rage in that instant he cared not whether he lived or died pushing himself to his foot again he staggered blindly toward snape the man he now hated a much a he hated voldemort himself sectum snape flicked his wand and the curse wa repelled yet again but harry wa mere foot away now and he could see snapes face clearly at last he wa no longer sneering or jeering the blazing flame showed a face full of rage mustering all his power of concentration harry thought levi no potter screamed snape there wa a loud bang and harry wa soaring backward hitting the ground hard again and this time his wand flew out of his hand he could hear hagrid yelling and fang howling a snape closed in and looked down on him where he lay wandless and defenseless a dumbledore had been snapes pale face illuminated by the flaming cabin wa suffused with hatred just a it had been before he had cursed dumbledore you dare use my own spell against me potter it wa i who invented them i the halfblood prince and you would turn my invention on me like your filthy father would you i do not think so no page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry had dived for his wand snape shot a hex at it and it flew foot away into the darkness and out of sight kill me then panted harry who felt no fear at all but only rage and contempt kill me like you killed him you coward do not screamed snape and his face wa suddenly demented inhuman a though he wa in a much pain a the yelping howling dog stuck in the burning house behind them call me coward and he slashed at the air harry felt a whitehot whiplike something hit him across the face and wa slammed backward into the ground spot of light burst in front of his eye and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body then he heard a rush of wing above him and something enormous obscured the star buckbeak had flown at snape who staggered backward a the razorsharp claw slashed at him a harry raised himself into a sitting position his head still swimming from it last contact with the ground he saw snape running a hard a he could the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching a harry had never heard him screech harry struggled to his foot looking around groggily for his wand hoping to give chase again but even a his finger fumbled in the grass discarding twig he knew it would be too late and sure enough by the time he had located his wand he turned only to see the hippogriff circling the gate snape had managed to disapparate just beyond the school boundary hagrid muttered harry still dazed looking around hagrid page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling he stumbled toward the burning house a an enormous figure emerged from out of the flame carrying fang on his back with a cry of thankfulness harry sank to his knee he wa shaking in every limb his body ached all over and his breath came in painful stab yeh all righ harry yeh all righ speak ter me harry hagrids huge hairy face wa swimming above harry blocking out the star harry could smell burnt wood and dog hair he put out a hand and felt fang reassuringly warm and alive body quivering beside him i am all right panted harry are you course i am take moren that ter finish me hagrid put his hand under harrys arm and raised him up with such force that harrys foot momentarily left the ground before hagrid set him upright again he could see blood trickling down hagrids cheek from a deep cut under one eye which wa swelling rapidly we should put out your house said harry the charm aguamenti knew it wa summat like that mumbled hagrid and he raised a smoldering pink flowery umbrella and said aguamenti a jet of water flew out of the umbrella tip harry raised his wand arm which felt like lead and murmured aguamenti too together he and hagrid poured water on the house until the last flame wa extinguished page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling snot too bad said hagrid hopefully a few minute later looking at the smoking wreck nothin dumbledore won be able to put righ harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name in the silence and the stillness horror rose inside him hagrid i wa bindin up a couple o bowtruckle leg when i heard them cornin said hagrid sadly still staring at his wrecked cabin they will have bin burnt ter twig poor little thing hagrid but what happened harry i jus saw them death eater runnin down from the castle but what the ruddy hell wa snape doin with them where is he gone wa he chasin them he harry cleared his throat it wa dry from panic and the smoke hagrid he killed killed said hagrid loudly staring down at harry snape killed what are yeh on abou harry dumbledore said harry snape killed dumbledore hagrid simply looked at him the little of his face that could be seen completely blank uncomprehending dumbledore wha harry he dead snape killed him page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling don say that said hagrid roughly snape kill dumbledore don be stupid harry whas made yeh say tha i saw it happen yeh couldn have i saw it hagrid hagrid shook his head his expression wa disbelieving but sympathetic and harry knew that hagrid thought he had sustained a blow to the head that he wa confused perhaps by the aftereffect of a jinx what musta happened wa dumbledore musta told snape ter go with them death eater hagrid said confidently i suppose he got to keep his cover look let u get yeh back up ter the school come on harry harry did not attempt to argue or explain he wa still shaking uncontrollably hagrid would find out soon enough too soon a they directed their step back toward the castle harry saw that many of it window were lit now he could imagine clearly the scene inside a people moved from room to room telling each other that death eater had got in that the mark wa shining over hogwarts that somebody must have been killed the oak front door stood open ahead of them light flooding out onto the drive and the lawn slowly uncertainly dressinggowned people were creeping down the step looking around nervously for some sign of the death eater who had fled into the night harrys eye however were fixed upon the ground at the foot of the tallest tower he imagined that he page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling could see a black huddled mass lying in the grass there though he wa really too far away to see anything of the sort even a he stared wordlessly at the place where he thought dumbledore s body must lie however he saw people beginning to move toward it what are they all lookin at said hagrid a he and harry approached the castle front fang keeping a close a he could to their ankle whas tha lyin on the grass hagrid added sharply heading now toward the foot of the astronomy tower where a small crowd wa congregating see it harry righ at the foot o the tower under where the mark blimey yeh don think someone got thrown hagrid fell silent the thought apparently too horrible to express aloud harry walked alongside him feeling the ache and pain in his face and his leg where the various hex of the last half hour had hit him though in an oddly detached way a though somebody near him wa suffering them what wa real and inescapable wa the awful pressing feeling in his chest he and hagrid moved dreamlike through the murmuring crowd to the very front where the dumbstruck student and teacher had left a gap harry heard hagrid s moan of pain and shock but he did not stop he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him he had known there wa no hope from the moment that the full bodybind curse dumbledore had placed upon him lifted known that it could have happened only because it caster wa dead but there wa still no preparation for seeing him here spreadeagled broken the greatest wizard harry had ever or would ever meet page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledores eye were closed but for the strange angle of his arm and leg he might have been sleeping harry reached out straightened the half moon spectacle upon the crooked nose and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth that never again would dumbledore speak to him never again could he help the crowd murmured behind harry after what seemed like a long time he became aware that he wa kneeling upon something hard and looked down the locket they had managed to steal so many hour before had fallen out of dumbledores pocket it had opened perhaps due to the force with which it hit the ground and although he could not feel more shock or horror or sadness than he felt already harry knew a he picked it up that there wa something wrong he turned the locket over in his hand this wa neither a large a the locket he remembered seeing in the pensieve nor were there any marking upon it no sign of the ornate s that wa supposed to be slytherins mark moreover there wa nothing inside but for a scrap of folded parchment wedged tightly into the place where a portrait should have been automatically without really thinking about what he wa doing harry pulled out the fragment of parchment opened it and read by the light of the many wand that had now been lit behind him to the dark lord i know i will be dead long before you read this page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but i want you to know that it wa i who discovered your secret i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it a soon a i can i face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more rab harry neither knew nor cared what the message meant only one thing mattered this wa not a horcrux dumbledore had weakened himself by drinking that terrible potion for nothing harry crumpled the parchment in his hand and his eye burned with tear a behind him fang began to howl page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling z the phoenix lament cmere harry no yeh can stay here harry come on now no he did not want to leave dumbledores side he did not want to move anywhere hagrids hand on his shoulder wa trembling then another voice said harry come on a much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and wa pulling him upward he obeyed it pressure without really thinking about it only a he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize from a trace of flowery scent on the air that it wa ginny who wa leading him back into the castle incomprehensible voice battered him sob and shout and wail stabbed the night but harry and ginny walked on back up the step into the entrance page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hall face swam on the edge of harrys vision people were peering at him whispering wondering and gryffindor ruby glistened on the floor like drop of blood a they made their way toward the marble staircase were going to the hospital wing said ginny i am not hurt said harry it mcgonagalls order said ginny everyone is up there ron and hermione and lupin and everyone fear stirred in harrys chest again he had forgotten the inert figure he had left behind ginny who else is dead do not worry none of u but the dark mark malfoy said he stepped over a body he stepped over bill but it all right he alive there wa something in her voice however that harry knew boded ill are you sure of course i am sure he a a bit of a mess that is all greyback attacked him madam pomfrey say he will not will not look the same anymore ginny s voice trembled a little we do not really know what the aftereffect will be i mean greyback being a werewolf but not transformed at the time page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but the others there were other body on the ground neville and professor flitwick are both hurt but madam pomfrey say they will be all right and a death eater dead he got hit by a killing curse that huge blond one wa firing off everywhere harry if we had not had your felix potion i think wed all have been killed but everything seemed to just miss u they had reached the hospital wing pushing open the door harry saw neville lying apparently asleep in a bed near the door ron hermione luna tonks and lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward at the sound of the door opening they all looked up hermione ran to harry and hugged him lupin moved forward too looking anxious are you all right harry i am fine how is bill nobody answered harry looked over hermiones shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on bill pillow so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque madam pomfrey wa dabbing at his wound with some harshsmelling green ointment harry remembered how snape had mended malfoys sectumsempra wound so easily with his wand can not you fix them with a charm or something he asked the matron no charm will work on these said madam pomfrey i have tried everything i know but there is no cure for werewolf bite page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling but he wa not bitten at the full moon said ron who wa gazing down into his brother face a though he could somehow force him to mend just by staring greyback had not transformed so surely bill will not be a a real he looked uncertainly at lupin no i do not think that bill will be a true werewolf said lupin but that doe not mean that there will not be some contamination those are cursed wound they are unlikely ever to heal fully and and bill might have some wolfish characteristic from now on dumbledore might know something that would work though ron said where is he bill fought those maniac on dumbledores order dumbledore owes him he can not leave him in this state ron dumbledores dead said ginny no lupin looked wildly from ginny to harry a though hoping the latter might contradict her but when harry did not lupin collapsed into a chair beside bill bed his hand over his face harry had never seen lupin lose control before he felt a though he wa intruding upon something private indecent he turned away and caught ron eye instead exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what ginny had said how did he die whispered tonks how did it happen snape killed him said harry i wa there i saw it we arrived back on the astronomy tower because that is where the mark wa dumbledore wa ill he wa weak but i think he realized it wa a trap when page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling we heard footstep running up the stair he immobilized me i could not do anything i wa under the invisibility cloak and then malfoy came through the door and disarmed him hermione clapped her hand to her mouth and ron groaned luna mouth trembled more death eater arrived and then snape and snape did it the avada kedavra harry could not go on madam pomfrey burst into tear nobody paid her any attention except ginny who whispered shh listen gulping madam pomfrey pressed her finger to her mouth her eye wide somewhere out in the darkness a phoenix wa singing in a way harry had never heard before a stricken lament of terrible beauty and harry felt a he had felt about phoenix song before that the music wa inside him not without it wa his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the ground and through the castle window how long they all stood there listening he did not know nor why it seemed to ease their pain a little to listen to the sound of their mourning but it felt like a long time later that the hospital door opened again and professor mcgonagall entered the ward like all the rest she bore mark of the recent battle there were graz on her face and her robe were ripped molly and arthur are on their way she said and the spell of the music wa broken everyone roused themselves a though coming out of trance turning again to look at bill or else to rub their own eye shake their head harry what happened according page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling to hagrid you were with professor dumbledore when he when it happened he say professor snape wa involved in some snape killed dumbledore said harry she stared at him for a moment then swayed alarmingly madam pomfrey who seemed to have pulled herself together ran forward conjuring a chair from thin air which she pushed under mcgonagall snape repeated mcgonagall faintly falling into the chair we all wondered but he trusted always snape i can not believe it snape wa a highly accomplished occlumens said lupin his voice uncharacteristically harsh we always knew that but dumbledore swore he wa on our side whispered tonks i always thought dumbledore must know something about snape that we did not he always hinted that he had an ironclad reason for trusting snape muttered professor mcgonagall now dabbing at the corner of her leaking eye with a tartan edged handkerchief i mean with snape s history of course people were bound to wonder but dumbledore told me explicitly that snape s repentance wa absolutely genuine would not hear a word against him id love to know what snape told him to convince him said tonks i know said harry and they all turned to look at him snape passed voldemort the information that made voldemort hunt down my mum and dad then snape told dumbledore he had not realized what he page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling wa doing he wa really sorry he would done it sorry that they were dead they all stared at him and dumbledore believed that said lupin incredulously dumbledore believed snape wa sorry james wa dead snape hated james and he did not think my mother wa worth a damn either said harry because she wa muggleborn mudblood he called her nobody asked how harry knew this all of them seemed to be lost in horrified shock trying to digest the monstrous truth of what had happened this is all my fault said professor mcgonagall suddenly she looked disoriented twisting her wet handkerchief in her hand my fault i sent filius to fetch snape tonight i actually sent for him to come and help u if i had not alerted snape to what wa going on he might never have joined force with the death eater i do not think he knew they were there before filius told him i do not think he knew they were coming it is not your fault minerva said lupin firmly we all wanted more help we were glad to think snape wa on his way so when he arrived at the fight he joined in on the death eater side asked harry who wanted every detail of snape s duplicity and infamy feverishly collecting more reason to hate him to swear vengeance i do not know exactly how it happened said professor mcgonagall distractedly it all so confusing page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore had told u that he would be leaving the school for a few hour and that we were to patrol the corridor just in case remus bill and nymphadora were to join u and so we patrolled all seemed quiet every secret passageway out of the school wa covered we knew nobody could fly in there were powerful enchantment on every entrance into the castle i still do not know how the death eater can possibly have entered i do said harry and he explained briefly about the pair of vanishing cabinet and the magical pathway they formed so they got in through the room of requirement almost against his will he glanced from ron to hermione both of whom looked devastated i messed up harry said ron bleakly we did like you told u we checked the marauder map and we could not see malfoy on it so we thought he must be in the room of requirement so me ginny and neville went to keep watch on it but malfoy got past u he came out of the room about an hour after we started keeping watch said ginny he wa on his own clutching that awful shriveled arm his hand of glory said ron give light only to the holder remember anyway ginny went on he must have been checking whether the coast wa clear to let the death eater out because the moment he saw u he threw something into the air and it all went pitchblack peruvian instant darkness powder said ron bitterly fred and george i am going to be having a page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling word with them about who they let buy their product we tried everything lumos incendio said ginny nothing would penetrate the darkness all we could do wa grope our way out of the corridor again and meanwhile we could hear people rushing past u obviously malfoy could see because of that hand thing and wa guiding them but we did not dare use any curse or anything in case we hit each other and by the time wed reached a corridor that wa light they would gone luckily said lupin hoarsely ron ginny and neville ran into u almost immediately and told u what had happened we found the death eater minute later heading in the direction of the astronomy tower malfoy obviously had not expected more people to be on the watch he seemed to have exhausted his supply of darkness powder at any rate a fight broke out they scattered and we gave chase one of them gibbon broke away and headed up the tower stair to set off the mark asked harry he must have done yes they must have arranged that before they left the room of requirement said lupin but i do not think gibbon liked the idea of waiting up there alone for dumbledore because he came running back downstairs to rejoin the fight and wa hit by a killing curse that just missed me so if ron wa watching the room of requirement with ginny and neville said harry turning to hermione were you outside snapes office yes whispered hermione her eye sparkling with tear with luna we hung page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling around for age outside it and nothing happened we did not know what wa going on upstairs ron had taken the map it wa nearly midnight when professor flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeon he wa shouting about death eater in the castle i do not think he really registered that luna and i were there at all he just burst his way into snapes office and we heard him saying that snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw u and and what harry urged her i wa so stupid harry said hermione in a high pitched whisper he said professor flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he while he went to help fight the death eater she covered her face in shame and continued to talk into her finger so that her voice wa muffled we went into his office to see if we could help professor flitwick and found him unconscious on the floor and oh it so obvious now snape must have stupefied flitwick but we did not realize harry we did not realize we just let snape go it not your fault said lupin firmly hermione had you not obeyed snape and got out of the way he probably would have killed you and luna so then he came upstairs said harry who wa watching snape running up the marble staircase in his mind eye his black robe billowing behind him a ever pulling his wand from under his cloak a he ascended and he found the place where you were all fighting page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling we were in trouble we were losing said tonks in a low voice gibbon wa down but the rest of the death eater seemed ready to fight to the death neville had been hurt bill had been savaged by greyback it wa all dark curse flying everywhere the malfoy boy had vanished he must have slipped past up the stair then more of them ran after him but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air none of u could break through said ron and that massive death eater wa still firing off jinx all over the place they were bouncing off the wall and barely missing u and then snape wa there said tonks and then he wa not i saw him running toward u but that huge death eater jinx just missed me right afterward and i ducked and lost track of thing said ginny i saw him run straight through the cursed barrier a though it wa not there said lupin i tried to follow him but wa thrown back just like neville he must have known a spell we did not whispered mcgonagall after all he wa the defense against the dark art teacher i just assumed that he wa in a hurry to chase after the death eater who would escaped up to the tower he wa said harry savagely but to help them not to stop them and ill bet you had to have a dark mark to get through that barrier so what happened when he came back down page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling well the big death eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in and also broke the curse blocking the stair said lupin we all ran forward those of u who were still standing anyway and then snape and the boy emerged out of the dust obviously none of u attacked them we just let them pas said tonks in a hollow voice we thought they were being chased by the death eater and next thing the other death eater and greyback were back and we were fighting again i thought i heard snape shout something but i do not know what he shouted it over said harry he would done what he would meant to do they all fell silent fawkes lament wa still echoing over the dark ground outside a the music reverberated upon the air unbidden unwelcome thought slunk into harrys mind had they taken dumbledores body from the foot of the tower yet what would happen to it next where would it rest he clenched his fist tightly in his pocket he could feel the small cold lump of the fake horcrux against the knuckle of his right hand the door of the hospital wing burst open making them all jump mr and mr weasley were striding up the ward fleur just behind them her beautiful face terrified molly arthur said professor mcgonagall jumping up and hurrying to greet them i am so sorry bill whispered mr weasley darting past professor mcgonagall a she caught sight of bill mangled face oh bill page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling lupin and tonks had got up hastily and retreated so that mr and mr weasley could get nearer to the bed mr weasley bent over her son and pressed her lip to his bloody forehead you said greyback attacked him mr weasley asked professor mcgonagall distractedly but he had not transformed so what doe that mean what will happen to bill we do not yet know said professor mcgonagall looking helplessly at lupin there will probably be some contamination arthur said lupin it is an odd case possibly unique we do not know what his behavior might be like when he awakens mr weasley took the nastysmelling ointment from madam pomfrey and began dabbing at bill wound and dumbledore said mr weasley minerva is it true is he really a professor mcgonagall nodded harry felt ginny move beside him and looked at her her slightly narrowed eye were fixed upon fleur who wa gazing down at bill with a frozen expression on her face dumbledore gone whispered mr weasley but mr weasley had eye only for her eldest son she began to sob tear falling onto bill mutilated face of course it doe not matter how he look it not rreally important but he wa a very handsome little bboy always very handsome and he wa g going to be married page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling and what do you mean by zat said fleur suddenly and loudly what do you mean e wa going to be married mr weasley raised her tearstained face looking startled well only that you theenk bill will not wish to marry me anymore demanded fleur you theenk because of these bite he will not love me no that is not what i because e will said fleur drawing herself up to her full height and throwing back her long mane of silver hair it would take more zan a werewolf to stop bill loving me well yes i am sure said mr weasley but i thought perhaps given how how he you thought i would not weesh to marry him or peraps you hoped said fleur her nostril flaring what do i care how he look i am goodlooking enough for both of u i theenk all these scar show is zat my husband is brave and i shall do zat she added fiercely pushing mr weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her mr weasley fell back against her husband and watched fleur mopping up bill wound with a most curious expression upon her face nobody said anything harry did not dare move like everybody else he wa waiting for the explosion our greatauntie muriel said mr weasley after a long pause ha a very beautiful tiara goblinmade which i am sure i could persuade her to lend you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling for the wedding she is very fond of bill you know and it would look lovely with your hair thank you said fleur stiffly i am sure zat will be lovely and then harry did not quite see how it happened both woman were cry and hugging each other completely bewildered wondering whether the world had gone mad he turned around ron looked a stunned a he felt and ginny and hermione were exchanging startled look you see said a strained voice tonks wa glaring at lupin she still want to marry him even though he been bitten she doe not care it different said lupin barely moving his lip and looking suddenly tense bill will not be a full werewolf the case are completely but i do not care either i do not care said tonks seizing the front of lupin robe and shaking them i have told you a million time and the meaning of tonkss patronus and her mouse colored hair and the reason she had come running to find dumbledore when she had heard a rumor someone had been attacked by greyback all suddenly became clear to harry it had not been sirius that tonks had fallen in love with after all and i have told you a million time said lupin refusing to meet her eye staring at the floor that i am too old for you too poor too dangerous i have said all along you are taking a ridiculous line on this remus said mr weasley over fleurs shoulder a she patted her on the back page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i am not being ridiculous said lupin steadily tonks deserves somebody young and whole but she want you said mr weasley with a small smile and after all remus young and whole men do not necessarily remain so he gestured sadly at his son lying between them this is not the moment to discus it said lupin avoiding everybodys eye a he looked around distractedly dumbledore is dead dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there wa a little more love in the world said professor mcgonagall curtly just a the hospital door opened again and hagrid walked in the little of his face that wa not obscured by hair or beard wa soaking and swollen he wa shaking with tear a vast spotted handkerchief in his hand i have i have done it professor he choked mmoved him professor sprout got the kid back in bed professor flitwicks lyin down but he say hell be all righ in a jiffy an professor slughorn say the ministry bin informed thank you hagrid said professor mcgonagall standing up at once and turning to look at the group around bill bed i shall have to see the ministry when they get here hagrid please tell the head of house slughorn can represent slytherin that i want to see them in my office forthwith i would like you to join u too a hagrid nodded turned and shuffled out of the room again she looked down at harry before i meet page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling them i would like a quick word with you harry if you will come with me harry stood up murmured see you in a bit to ron hermione and ginny and followed professor mcgonagall back down the ward the corridor outside were deserted and the only sound wa the distant phoenix song it wa several minute before harry became aware that they were not heading for professor mcgonagalls office but for dumbledores and another few second before he realized that of course she had been deputy headmistress apparently she wa now headmistress so the room behind the gargoyle wa now hers in silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office he did not know what he had expected that the room would be draped in black perhaps or even that dumbledores body might be lying there in fact it looked almost exactly a it had done when he and dumbledore had left it mere hour previously the silver instrument whirring and puffing on their spindlelegged table gryffindors sword in it glass case gleaming in the moonlight the sorting hat on a shelf behind the desk but fawkes perch stood empty he wa still cry his lament to the ground and a new portrait had joined the rank of the dead headmaster and headmistress of hogwarts dumbledore wa slumbering in a golden frame over the desk his half moon spectacle perched upon his crooked nose looking peaceful and untroubled after glancing once at this portrait professor mcgonagall made an odd movement a though steeling herself then rounded the desk to look at harry her face taut and lined page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling harry she said i would like to know what you and professor dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school i can not tell you that professor said harry he had expected the question and had his answer ready it had been here in this very room that dumbledore had told him that he wa to confide the content of their lesson to nobody but ron and hermione harry it might be important said professor mcgonagall it is said harry very but he did not want me to tell anyone professor mcgonagall glared at him potter harry registered the renewed use of his surname in the light of professor dumbledores death i think you must see that the situation ha changed somewhat i do not think so said harry shrugging professor dumbledore never told me to stop following his order if he died but there is one thing you should know before the ministry get here though madam rosmertas under the imperius curse she wa helping malfoy and the death eater that is how the necklace and the poisoned mead rosmerta said professor mcgonagall incredulously but before she could go on there wa a knock on the door behind them and professor sprout flitwick and slughorn traipsed into the room followed by page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling hagrid who wa still weeping copiously his huge frame trembling with grief snape ejaculated slughorn who looked the most shaken pale and sweating snape i taught him i thought i knew him but before any of them could respond to this a sharp voice spoke from high on the wall a sallowfaced wizard with a short black fringe had just walked back into his empty canvas minerva the minister will be here within second he ha just disapparated from the ministry thank you everard said professor mcgonagall and she turned quickly to her teacher i want to talk about what happens to hogwarts before he get here she said quickly personally i am not convinced that the school should reopen next year the death of the headmaster at the hand of one of our colleague is a terrible stain upon hogwarts s history it is horrible i am sure dumbledore would have wanted the school to remain open said professor sprout i feel that if a single pupil want to come then the school ought to remain open for that pupil but will we have a single pupil after this said slughorn now dabbing his sweating brow with a silken handkerchief parent will want to keep their child at home and i can not say i blame them personally i do not think were in more danger at hogwarts than we are anywhere else but you can not expect mother to think like that they will want to keep their family together it only natural page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i agree said professor mcgonagall and in any case it is not true to say that dumbledore never envisaged a situation in which hogwarts might close when the chamber of secret reopened he considered the closure of the school and i must say that professor dumbledores murder is more disturbing to me than the idea of slytherins monster living undetected in the bowel of the castle we must consult the governor said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice he had a large bruise on his forehead but seemed otherwise unscathed by his collapse in snapes office we must follow the established procedure a decision should not be made hastily hagrid you have not said anything said professor mcgonagall what are your view ought hogwarts to remain open hagrid who had been weeping silently into his large spotted handkerchief throughout this conversation now raised puffy red eye and croaked i do not know professor that is fer the head of house an the headmistress ter decide professor dumbledore always valued your view said professor mcgonagall kindly and so do i well i am stayin said hagrid fat tear still leaking out of the corner of his eye and trickling down into his tangled beard it me home it bin me home since i wa thirteen an if there is kid who wan me ter teach them ill do it but i do not know hogwarts without dumbledore he gulped and disappeared behind his handkerchief once more and there wa silence page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling very well said professor mcgonagall glancing out of the window at the ground checking to see whether the minister wa yet approaching then i must agree with filius that the right thing to do is to consult the governor who will make the final decision now a to getting student home there is an argument for doing it sooner rather than later we could arrange for the hogwarts express to come tomorrow if necessary what about dumbledores funeral said harry speaking at last well said professor mcgonagall losing a little of her briskness a her voice shook i i know that it wa dumbledores wish to be laid to rest here at hogwarts then that is what will happen is not it said harry fiercely if the ministry think it appropriate said professor mcgonagall no other headmaster or headmistress ha ever been no other headmaster or headmistress ever gave more to this school growled hagrid hogwarts should be dumbledores final resting place said professor flitwick absolutely said professor sprout and in that case said harry you should not send the student home until the funeral over they will want to say page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the last word caught in his throat but professor sprout completed the sentence for him goodbye well said squeaked professor flitwick well said indeed our student should pay tribute it is fitting we can arrange transport home afterward seconded barked professor sprout i suppose yes said slughorn in a rather agitated voice while hagrid let out a strangled sob of assent he coming said professor mcgonagall suddenly gazing down into the ground the minister and by the look of it he brought a delegation can i leave professor said harry at once he had no desire at all to see or be interrogated by rufus scrimgeour tonight you may said professor mcgonagall and quickly she strode toward the door and held it open for him he sped down the spiral staircase and off along the deserted corridor he had left his invisibility cloak at the top of the astronomy tower but it did not matter there wa nobody in the corridor to see him pas not even filch mr norris or peeve he did not meet another soul until he turned into the passage leading to the gryffindor common room is it true whispered the fat lady a he approached her it is really true dumbledore dead yes said harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she let out a wail and without waiting for the password swung forward to admit him a harry had suspected it would be the common room wa jampacked the room fell silent a he climbed through the portrait hole he saw dean and seamus sitting in a group nearby this meant that the dormitory must be empty or nearly so without speaking to anybody without making eye contact at all harry walked straight across the room and through the door to the boy dormitory a he had hoped ron wa waiting for him still fully dressed sitting on his bed harry sat down on his own fourposter and for a moment they simply stared at each other they are talking about closing the school said harry lupin said they would said ron there wa a pause so said ron in a very low voice a though he thought the furniture might be listening in did you find one did you get it a a horcrux harry shook his head all that had taken place around that black lake seemed like an old nightmare now had it really happened and only hour ago you did not get it said ron looking crestfallen it wa not there no said harry someone had already taken it and left a fake in it place already taken page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling wordlessly harry pulled the fake locket from his pocket opened it and passed it to ron the full story could wait it did not matter tonight nothing mattered except the end the end of their pointless adventure the end of dumbledores life rab whispered ron but who wa that do not know said harry lying back on his bed fully clothed and staring blankly upwards he felt no curiosity at all about rab he doubted that he would ever feel curious again a he lay there he became aware suddenly that the ground were silent fawkes had stopped singing and he knew without knowing how he knew it that the phoenix had gone had left hogwarts for good just a dumbledore had left the school had left the world had left harry page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the white tomb all lesson were suspended all examination postponed some student were hurried away from hogwarts by their parent over the next couple of day the patil twin were gone before breakfast on the morning following dumbledores death and zacharias smith wa escorted from the castle by his haughtylooking father seamus finnigan on the other hand refused pointblank to accompany his mother home they had a shouting match in the entrance hall that wa resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral she had difficulty in finding a bed in hogsmeade seamus told harry and ron for wizard and witch were pouring into the village preparing to pay their last respect to dumbledore some excitement wa caused among the younger student who had never seen it before when a powderblue carriage the size of a house pulled by a dozen giant winged palomino came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling landed on the edge of the forest harry watched from a window a a gigantic and handsome oliveskinned blackhaired woman descended the carriage step and threw herself into the waiting hagrids arm meanwhile a delegation of ministry official including the minister of magic himself wa being accommodated within the castle harry wa diligently avoiding contact with any of them he wa sure that sooner or later he would be asked again to account for dumbledores last excursion from hogwarts harry ron hermione and ginny were spending all of their time together the beautiful weather seemed to mock them harry could imagine how it would have been if dumbledore had not died and they had had this time together at the very end of the year ginnys examination finished the pressure of homework lifted and hour by hour he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say doing what he knew wa right to do because it wa too hard to forgo his best source of comfort they visited the hospital wing twice a day neville had been discharged but bill remained under madam pomfreys care his scar were a bad a ever in truth he now bore a distinct resemblance to madeye moody though thankfully with both eye and leg but in personality he seemed just the same a ever all that appeared to have changed wa that he now had a great liking for very rare steak so eet ee lucky e is marrying me said fleur happily plumping up bill pillow because ze british overcook their meat i ave always said this i suppose i am just going to have to accept that he really is going to marry her sighed ginny later that evening a she harry ron and hermione sat beside page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the open window of the gryffindor common room looking out over the twilit ground she is not that bad said harry ugly though he added hastily a ginny raised her eyebrow and she let out a reluctant giggle well i suppose if mum can stand it i can anyone else we know died ron asked hermione who wa perusing the evening prophet hermione winced at the forced toughness in his voice no she said reprovingly folding up the newspaper they are still looking for snape but no sign of course there is not said harry who became angry every time this subject cropped up they will not find snape till they find voldemort and seeing a they have never managed to do that in all this time i am going to go to bed yawned ginny i have not been sleeping that well since well i could do with some sleep she kissed harry ron looked away pointedly waved at the other two and departed for the girl dormitory the moment the door had closed behind her hermione leaned forward toward harry with a most hermioneish look on her face harry i found something out this morning in the library rab said harry sitting up straight he did not feel the way he had so often felt before excited curious burning to get to the bottom of a mystery he simply knew that the task of discovering page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling the truth about the real horcrux had to be completed before he could move a little farther along the dark and winding path stretching ahead of him the path that he and dumbledore had set out upon together and which he now knew he would have to journey alone there might still be a many a four horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there wa even a possibility that voldemort could be killed he kept reciting their name to himself a though by listing them he could bring them within reach the locket the cup the snake something of gryffindors or ravenclaws the locket the cup the snake something of gryffindors or ravenclaws this mantra seemed to pulse through harrys mind a he fell asleep at night and his dream were thick with cup locket and mysterious object that he could not quite reach though dumbledore helpfully offered harry a rope ladder that turned to snake the moment he began to climb he had shown hermione the note inside the locket the morning after dumbledore s death and although she had not immediately recognized the initial a belonging to some obscure wizard about whom she had been reading she had since been rushing off to the library a little more often than wa strictly necessary for somebody who had no homework to do no she said sadly i have been trying harry but i have not found anything there are a couple of reasonably wellknown wizard with those initial rosalind antigone bung rupert axebanger brookstanton but they do not seem to fit at all judging by that note the person who stole the horcrux knew voldemort and i can not find a shred of evidence that bung or axebanger ever had anything page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling to do with him no actually it about well snape she looked nervous even saying the name again what about him asked harry heavily slumping back in his chair well it just that i wa sort of right about the half blood prince business she said tentatively dyou have to rub it in hermione how dyou think i feel about that now no no harry i did not mean that she said hastily looking around to check that they were not being overheard it just that i wa right about eileen prince once owning the book you see she wa snape s mother i thought she wa not much of a looker said ron hermione ignored him i wa going through the rest of the old prophet and there wa a tiny announcement about eileen prince marrying a man called tobias snape and then later an announcement saying that she would given birth to a murderer spat harry well yes said hermione so i wa sort of right snape must have been proud of being half a prince you see tobias snape wa a muggle from what it said in the prophet yeah that fit said harry he would play up the pure blood side so he could get in with lucius malfoy and the rest of them he just like voldemort pure page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling blood mother muggle father ashamed of his parentage trying to make himself feared using the dark art gave himself an impressive new name lord voldemort the halfblood prince how could dumbledore have missed he broke off looking out the window he could not stop himself dwelling upon dumbledore s inexcusable trust in snape but a hermione had just inadvertently reminded him he harry had been taken in just the same in spite of the increasing nastiness of those scribbled spell he had refused to believe ill of the boy who had been so clever who had helped him so much helped him it wa an almost unendurable thought now i still do not get why he did not turn you in for using that book said ron he must have known where you were getting it all from he knew said harry bitterly he knew when i used sectumsempra he did not really need legilimency he might even have known before then with slughorn talking about how brilliant i wa at potion should not have left his old book in the bottom of that cupboard should he but why did not he turn you in i do not think he wanted to associate himself with that book said hermione i do not think dumbledore would have liked it very much if he would known and even if snape pretended it had not been his slughorn would have recognized his writing at once anyway the book wa left in snapes old classroom and ill bet dumbledore knew his mother wa called prince page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling i should have shown the book to dumbledore said harry all that time he wa showing me how voldemort wa evil even when he wa at school and i had proof snape wa too evil is a strong word said hermione quietly you were the one who kept telling me the book wa dangerous i am trying to say harry that you are putting too much blame on yourself i thought the prince seemed to have a nasty sense of humor but i would never have guessed he wa a potential killer none of u could have guessed snape would you know said ron silence fell between them each of them lost in their own thought but harry wa sure that they like him were thinking about the following morning when dumbledores body would be laid to rest he had never attended a funeral before there had been no body to bury when sirius had died he did not know what to expect and wa a little worried about what he might see about how he would feel he wondered whether dumbledores death would be more real to him once it wa over though he had moment when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him there were blank stretch of numbness where despite the fact that nobody wa talking about anything else in the whole castle he still found it difficult to believe that dumbledore had really gone admittedly he had not a he had with sirius looked desperately for some kind of loophole some way that dumbledore would come back he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake horcrux which he now carried with him everywhere not a a talisman but page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling a a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do harry rose early to pack the next day the hogwarts express would be leaving an hour after the funeral downstairs he found the mood in the great hall subdued everybody wa wearing their dress robe and no one seemed very hungry professor mcgonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty hagrids chair wa deserted too harry thought that perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast but snapes place had been unceremoniously filled by rufus scrimgeour harry avoided his yellowish eye a they scanned the hall harry had the uncomfortable feeling that scrimgeour wa looking for him among scrimgeours entourage harry spotted the red hair and hornrimmed glass of percy weasley ron gave no sign that he wa aware of percy apart from stabbing piece of kipper with unwonted venom over at the slytherin table crabbe and goyle were muttering together hulking boy though they were they looked oddly lonely without the tall pale figure of malfoy between them bossing them around harry had not spared malfoy much thought his animosity wa all for snape but he had not forgotten the fear in malfoys voice on that tower top nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other death eater arrived harry did not believe that malfoy would have killed dumbledore he despised malfoy still for his infatuation with the dark art but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike where harry wondered wa malfoy now and what wa voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parent harrys thought were interrupted by a nudge in the rib from ginny professor mcgonagall had risen to page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling her foot and the mournful hum in the hall died away at once it is nearly time she said please follow your head of house out into the ground gryffindors after me they filed out from behind their bench in near silence harry glimpsed slughorn at the head of the slytherin column wearing magnificent long emerald green robe embroidered with silver he had never seen professor sprout head of the hufflepuffs looking so clean there wa not a single patch on her hat and when they reached the entrance hall they found madam pince standing beside filch she in a thick black veil that fell to her knee he in an ancient black suit and tie reeking of mothball they were heading a harry saw when he stepped out onto the stone step from the front door toward the lake the warmth of the sun caressed his face a they followed professor mcgonagall in silence to the place where hundred of chair had been set out in row an aisle ran down the center of them there wa a marble table standing at the front all chair facing it it wa the most beautiful summer day an extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chair shabby and smart old and young most harry did not recognize but a few he did including member of the order of the phoenix kingsley shacklebolt madeye moody tonks her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink remus lupin with whom she seemed to be holding hand mr and mr weasley bill supported by fleur and followed by fred and george who were wearing jacket of black dragon skin then there wa madame maxime who took up two and a half chair on her own tom the landlord of the leaky cauldron page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling in london arabella figg harrys squib neighbor the hairy bass player from the wizarding group the weird sister ernie prang driver of the knight bus madam malkin of the robe shop in diagon alley and some people whom harry merely knew by sight such a the barman of the hog head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the hogwarts express the castle ghost were there too barely visible in the bright sunlight discernible only when they moved shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air harry ron hermione and ginny filed into seat at the end of a row beside the lake people were whispering to each other it sounded like a breeze in the grass but the birdsong wa louder by far the crowd continued to swell with a great rush of affection for both of them harry saw neville being helped into a seat by luna neville and luna alone of the da had responded to hermione s summons the night that dumbledore had died and harry knew why they were the one who had missed the da most probably the one who had checked their coin regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting cornelius fudge walked past toward the front row his expression miserable twirling his green bowler hat a usual harry next recognized rita skeeter who he wa infuriated to see had a notebook clutched in her redtaloned hand and then with a worse jolt of fury dolores umbridge an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face a black velvet bow set atop her ironcolored curl at the sight of the centaur firenze who wa standing like a sentinel near the water edge she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away the staff wa seated at last harry could see scrimgeour looking grave and dignified in the front page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling row with professor mcgonagall he wondered whether scrimgeour or any of these important people were really sorry that dumbledore wa dead but then he heard music strange otherworldly music and he forgot his dislike of the ministry in looking around for the source of it he wa not the only one many head were turning searching a little alarmed in there whispered ginny in harrys ear and he saw them in the clear green sunlit water inch below the surface reminding him horribly of the inferi a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand their pallid face rippling their purplish hair flowing all around them the music made the hair on harrys neck stand up and yet it wa not unpleasant it spoke very clearly of loss and of despair a he looked down into the wild face of the singer he had the feeling that they at least were sorry for dumbledores passing then ginny nudged him again and he looked around hagrid wa walking slowly up the aisle between the chair he wa cry quite silently his face gleaming with tear and in his arm wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden star wa what harry knew to be dumbledores body a sharp pain rose in harrys throat at this sight for a moment the strange music and the knowledge that dumbledores body wa so close seemed to take all warmth from the day ron looked white and shocked tear were falling thick and fast into both ginny s and hermiones lap they could not see clearly what wa happening at the front hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table now he retreated down the aisle blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noise that drew scandalized look from some including harry saw dolores umbridge but harry knew that page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling dumbledore would not have cared he tried to make a friendly gesture to hagrid a he passed but hagrids eye were so swollen it wa a wonder he could see where he wa going harry glanced at the back row to which hagrid wa heading and realized what wa guiding him for there dressed in a jacket and trouser each the size of a small marquee wa the giant grawp his great ugly boulderlike head bowed docile almost human hagrid sat down next to his halfbrother and grawp patted hagrid hard on the head so that his chair leg sank into the ground harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh but then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again a little tuftyhaired man in plain black robe had got to his foot and stood now in front of dumbledore s body harry could not hear what he wa saying odd word floated back to them over the hundred of head nobility of spirit intellectual contribution greatness of heart it did not mean very much it had little to do with dumbledore a harry had known him he suddenly remembered dumbledore s idea of a few word nitwit oddment blubber and tweak and again had to suppress a grin what wa the matter with him there wa a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen too he remembered dumbledore crouching at the water edge two year ago very close to where harry now sat and conversing in mermish with the merchieftainess harry wondered where dumbledore had learned mermish there wa so much he had never asked him so much he should have said and then without warning it swept over him the dreadful truth more completely and undeniably than it had until now dumbledore wa dead gone he page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt but he could not prevent hot tear spilling from his eye he looked away from ginny and the others and stared out over the lake toward the forest a the little man in black droned on there wa movement among the tree the centaur had come to pay their respect too they did not move into the open but harry saw them standing quite still half hidden in shadow watching the wizard their bow hanging at their side and harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the forest the first time he had ever encountered the thing that wa then voldemort and how he had faced him and how he and dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter it wa important dumbledore said to fight and fight again and keep fighting for only then could evil be kept at bay though never quite eradicated and harry saw very clearly a he sat there under the hot sun how people who cared about him had stood in front of him one by one his mother his father his godfather and finally dumbledore all determined to protect him but now that wa over he could not let anybody else stand between him and voldemort he must abandon forever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one that the shelter of a parent arm meant that nothing could hurt him there wa no waking from his nightmare no comforting whisper in the dark that he wa safe really that it wa all in his imagination the last and greatest of his protector had died and he wa more alone than he had ever been before the little man in black had stopped speaking at last and resumed his seat harry waited for somebody else to get to their foot he expected speech probably from the minister but nobody moved page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling then several people screamed bright white flame had erupted around dumbledores body and the table upon which it lay higher and higher they rose obscuring the body white smoke spiraled into the air and made strange shape harry thought for one heart stopping moment that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue but next second the fire had vanished in it place wa a white marble tomb encasing dumbledores body and the table on which he had rested there were a few more cry of shock a a shower of arrow soared through the air but they fell far short of the crowd it wa harry knew the centaur tribute he saw them turn tail and disappear back into the cool tree likewise the merpeople sank slowly back into the green water and were lost from view harry looked at ginny ron and hermione ron face wa screwed up a though the sunlight were blinding him hermione s face wa glazed with tear but ginny wa no longer cry she met harrys gaze with the same hard blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the quidditch cup in his absence and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly and that when he told her what he wa going to do now she would not say be careful or do not do it but accept his decision because she would not have expected anything le of him and so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since dumbledore had died ginny listen he said very quietly a the buzz of conversation grew louder around them and people began to get to their foot i can not be involved with you anymore we have got to stop seeing each other we can not be together page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling she said with an oddly twisted smile it for some stupid noble reason is not it it been like like something out of someone el life these last few week with you said harry but i can not we can not i have got thing to do alone now she did not cry she simply looked at him voldemort us people his enemy are close to he already used you a bait once and that wa just because you are my best friend sister think how much danger you will be in if we keep this up hell know hell find out hell try and get to me through you what if i do not care said ginny fiercely i care said harry how do you think id feel if this wa your funeral and it wa my fault she looked away from him over the lake i never really gave up on you she said not really i always hoped hermione told me to get on with life maybe go out with some other people relax a bit around you because i never used to be able to talk if you were in the room remember and she thought you might take a bit more notice if i wa a bit more myself smart girl that hermione said harry trying to smile i just wish id asked you sooner we could have had age month year maybe but you have been too busy saving the wizarding world said ginny half laughing well i can not say i am surprised i knew this would happen in the end i page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling knew you would not be happy unless you were hunting voldemort maybe that is why i like you so much harry could not bear to hear these thing nor did he think his resolution would hold if he remained sitting beside her ron he saw wa now holding hermione and stroking her hair while she sobbed into his shoulder tear dripping from the end of his own long nose with a miserable gesture harry got up turned his back on ginny and on dumbledores tomb and walked away around the lake moving felt much more bearable than sitting still just a setting out a soon a possible to track down the horcruxes and kill voldemort would feel better than waiting to do it harry he turned rufus scrimgeour wa limping rapidly toward him around the bank leaning on his walking stick i have been hoping to have a word do you mind if i walk a little way with you no said harry indifferently and set off again harry this wa a dreadful tragedy said scrimgeour quietly i can not tell you how appalled i wa to hear of it dumbledore wa a very great wizard we had our disagreement a you know but no one know better than i what do you want asked harry flatly scrimgeour looked annoyed but a before hastily modified his expression to one of sorrowful understanding page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling you are of course devastated he said i know that you were very close to dumbledore i think you may have been his favorite pupil ever the bond between the two of you what do you want harry repeated coming to a halt scrimgeour stopped too leaned on his stick and stared at harry his expression shrewd now the word is that you were with him when he left the school the night that he died whose word said harry somebody stupefied a death eater on top of the tower after dumbledore died there were also two broomstick up there the ministry can add two and two harry glad to hear it said harry well where i went with dumbledore and what we did is my business he did not want people to know such loyalty is admirable of course said scrimgeour who seemed to be restraining his irritation with difficulty but dumbledore is gone harry he gone he will only be gone from the school when none here are loyal to him said harry smiling in spite of himself my dear boy even dumbledore can not return from the i am not saying he can you would not understand but i have got nothing to tell you page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling scrimgeour hesitated then said in what wa evidently supposed to be a tone of delicacy the ministry can offer you all sort of protection you know harry i would be delighted to place a couple of my aurors at your service harry laughed voldemort want to kill me himself and aurors will not stop him so thanks for the offer but no thanks so said scrimgeour his voice cold now the request i made of you at christmas what request oh yeah the one where i tell the world what a great job you are doing in exchange for for raising everyone is morale snapped scrimgeour harry considered him for a moment released stan shunpike yet scrimgeour turned a nasty purple color highly reminiscent of uncle vernon i see you are dumbledores man through and through said harry that is right scrimgeour glared at him for another moment then turned and limped away without another word harry could see percy and the rest of the ministry delegation waiting for him casting nervous glance at the sobbing hagrid and grawp who were still in their seat ron and hermione were hurrying toward harry passing scrimgeour going in the opposite direction harry turned and walked slowly on waiting page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling for them to catch up which they finally did in the shade of a beech tree under which they had sat in happier time what did scrimgeour want hermione whispered same a he wanted at christmas shrugged harry wanted me to give him inside information on dumbledore and be the ministry new poster boy ron seemed to struggle with himself for a moment then he said loudly to hermione look let me go back and hit percy no she said firmly grabbing his arm it will make me feel better harry laughed even hermione grinned a little though her smile faded a she looked up at the castle i can not bear the idea that we might never come back she said softly how can hogwarts close maybe it will not said ron were not in any more danger here than we are at home are we everywheres the same now id even say hogwarts is safer there are more wizard inside to defend the place what dyou reckon harry i am not coming back even if it doe reopen said harry ron gaped at him but hermione said sadly i knew you were going to say that but then what will you do page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling tm going back to the dursleys once more because dumbledore wanted me to said harry but it will be a short visit and then ill be gone for good but where will you go if you do not come back to school i thought i might go back to godrics hollow harry muttered he had had the idea in his head ever since the night of dumbledores death for me it started there all of it i have just got a feeling i need to go there and i can visit my parent graf id like that and then what said ron then i have got to track down the rest of the horcruxes have not i said harry his eye upon dumbledores white tomb reflected in the water on the other side of the lake that is what he wanted me to do that is why he told me all about them if dumbledore wa right and i am sure he wa there are still four of them out there i have got to find them and destroy them and then i have got to go after the seventh bit of voldemorts soul the bit that is still in his body and i am the one who is going to kill him and if i meet severus snape along the way he added so much the better for me so much the worse for him there wa a long silence the crowd had almost dispersed now the straggler giving the monumental figure of grawp a wide berth a he cuddled hagrid whose howl of grief were still echoing across the water well be there harry said ron what page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling at your aunt and uncle house said ron and then well go with you wherever you are going no said harry quickly he had not counted on this he had meant them to understand that he wa undertaking this most dangerous journey alone you said to u once before said hermione quietly that there wa time to turn back if we wanted to we have had time have not we were with you whatever happens said ron but mate you are going to have to come round my mum and dad house before we do anything else even godrics hollow why bill and fleurs wedding remember harry looked at him startled the idea that anything a normal a a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful yeah we should not miss that he said finally his hand closed automatically around the fake horcrux but in spite of everything in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself in spite of the final meeting with voldemort he knew must come whether in a month in a year or in ten he felt his heart lift at the thought that there wa still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with ron and hermione page harry potter and the half blood prince jk rowling
