the hottest day of the summer so far wa drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large square house of privet drive car that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drive and lawn that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing the use of hosepipe had been banned due to drought deprived of their usual carwashing and lawnmowing pursuit the inhabitant of privet drive had retreated into the shade of their cool house window thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze the only person left outdoors wa a teenage boy who wa lying flat on his back in a flower bed outside number four he wa a skinny blackhaired bespectacled boy who had the pinched slightly unhealthy look of someone who ha grown a lot in a short space of time his jean were torn and dirty his tshirt baggy and faded and the sol of his trainer were peeling away from the upper harry potter appearance did not endear him to the neighbor who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling punishable by law but a he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he wa quite invisible to passersby in fact the only way he would be spotted wa if his uncle vernon or aunt petunia stuck their head out of the living room window and looked straight down into the flower bed below on the whole harry thought he wa to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here he wa not perhaps very comfortable lying on the hot hard earth but on the other hand nobody wa glaring at him grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news or shooting nasty question at him a had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room and watching television with his aunt and uncle almost a though this thought had fluttered through the open window vernon dursley harrys uncle suddenly spoke glad to see the boy stopped trying to butt in where is he anyway i do not know said aunt petunia unconcernedly not in the house uncle vernon grunted watching the news he said scathingly id like to know what he really up to a if a normal boy care what is on the news dudley ha not got a clue what is going on doubt he know who the prime minister is anyway it not a if there d be anything about his lot on our news vernon shh said aunt petunia the window open oh yes sorry dear page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the dursleys fell silent harry listened to a jingle about fruit n bran breakfast cereal while he watched mr figg a batty catloving old lady from nearby wisteria walk amble slowly past she wa frowning and muttering to herself harry wa very pleased that he wa concealed behind the bush mr figg had recently taken to asking him around for tea whenever she met him in the street she had rounded the corner and vanished from view before uncle vernons voice floated out of the window again dudders out for tea at the polkisses said aunt petunia fondly he got so many little friend he so popular harry repressed a snort with difficulty the dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son dudley they had swallowed all his dimwitted lie about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holiday harry knew perfectly well that dudley had not been to tea anywhere he and his gang spent every evening vandalizing the play park smoking on street corner and throwing stone at passing car and child harry had seen them at it during his evening walk around little whinging he had spent most of the holiday wandering the street scavenging newspaper from bin along the way the opening note of the music that heralded the seven of the clock news reached harrys ear and his stomach turned over perhaps tonight after a month of waiting would be the night record number of stranded holidaymaker fill airport a the spanish baggagehandlers strike reach it second week page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling give them a lifelong siesta i would snarled uncle vernon over the end of the newsreader sentence but no matter outside in the flower bed harrys stomach seemed to unclench if anything had happened it would surely have been the first item on the news death and destruction were more important than stranded holidaymaker he let out a long slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky every day this summer had been the same the tension the expectation the temporary relief and then mounting tension again and always growing more insistent all the time the question of why nothing had happened yet he kept listening just in case there wa some small clue not recognized for what it really wa by the muggles an unexplained disappearance perhaps or some strange accident but the baggagehandlers strike wa followed by news on the drought in the southeast i hope he listening next door bellowed uncle vernon with his sprinkler on at three in the morning then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in surrey then a famous actress divorce from her famous husband a if were interested in their sordid affair sniffed aunt petunia who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hand on harry closed his eye against the now blazing evening sky a the newsreader said and finally bungy the budgie ha found a novel way of keeping cool this summer bungy who life at the five feather in barnsley ha learned to waterski mary dorkins went to find out more harry opened his eye again if they had reached waterskiing budgerigar there wa nothing else worth hearing he rolled cautiously onto his front and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling raised himself onto his knee and elbow preparing to crawl out from under the window he had moved about two inch when several thing happened in very quick succession a loud echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight a shriek a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the dursleys living room and a though harry had been waiting for this signal he jumped to his foot at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jean a thin wooden wand a if he were unsheathing a sword but before he could draw himself up to full height the top of his head collided with the dursleys open window and the resultant crash made aunt petunia scream even louder harry felt a if his head had been split in two eye streaming he swayed trying to focus on the street and spot the source of the noise but he had barely staggered upright again when two large purple hand reached through the open window and closed tightly around his throat put it away uncle vernon snarled into harrys ear now before anyone see get off me harry gasped for a few second they struggled harry pulling at his uncle sausage like finger with his left hand his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wand then a the pain in the top of harrys head gave a particularly nasty throb uncle vernon yelped and released harry a though he had received an electric shock some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew making him impossible to hold page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling panting harry fell forward over the hydrangea bush straightened up and stared around there wa no sign of what had caused the loud cracking noise but there were several face peering through various nearby window harry stuffed his wand hastily back into his jean and tried to look innocent lovely evening shouted uncle vernon waving at mr number seven who wa glaring from behind her net curtain did you hear that car backfire just now gave petunia and me quite a turn he continued to grin in a horrible manic way until all the curious neighbor had disappeared from their various window then the grin became a grimace of rage a he beckoned harry back toward him harry moved a few step closer taking care to stop just short of the point at which uncle vernons outstretched hand could resume their strangling what the devil do you mean by it boy asked uncle vernon in a croaky voice that trembled with fury what do i mean by what said harry coldly he kept looking left and right up the street still hoping to see the person who had made the cracking noise making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our i did not make that noise said harry firmly aunt petunia thin horsey face now appeared beside uncle vernons wide purple one she looked livid why were you lurking under our window page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes yes good point petunia what were you doing under our window boy listening to the news said harry in a resigned voice his aunt and uncle exchanged look of outrage listening to the news again well it change every day you see said harry do not you be clever with me boy i want to know what you are really up to and do not give me any more of this listening to the news tosh you know perfectly well that your lot careful vernon breathed aunt petunia and uncle vernon lowered his voice so that harry could barely hear him that your lot do not get on our news that is all you know said harry the dursleys goggled at him for a few second then aunt petunia said you are a nasty little liar what are all those she too lowered her voice so that harry had to lipread the next word owl doing if they are not bringing you news aha said uncle vernon in a triumphant whisper get out of that one boy a if we did not know you get all your news from those pestilential bird harry hesitated for a moment it cost him something to tell the truth this time even though his aunt and uncle could not possibly know how bad harry felt at admitting it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the owl are not bringing me news said harry tonelessly i do not believe it said aunt petunia at once no more do i said uncle vernon forcefully we know you are up to something funny said aunt petunia were not stupid you know said uncle vernon well that is news to me said harry his temper rising and before the dursleys could call him back he had wheeled about crossed the front lawn stepped over the low garden wall and wa striding off up the street he wa in trouble now and he knew it he would have to face his aunt and uncle later and pay the price for his rudeness but he did not care very much just at the moment he had much more pressing matter on his mind harry wa sure that the cracking noise had been made by someone apparating or disapparating it wa exactly the sound dobby the houseelf made when he vanished into thin air wa it possible that dobby wa here in privet drive could dobby be following him right at this very moment a this thought occurred he wheeled around and stared back down privet drive but it appeared to be completely deserted again and harry wa sure that dobby did not know how to become invisible he walked on hardly aware of the route he wa taking for he had pounded these street so often lately that his foot carried him to his favorite haunt automatically every few step he glanced back over page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling his shoulder someone magical had been near him a he lay among aunt petunia dying begonia he wa sure of it why had not they spoken to him why had not they made contact why were they hiding now and then a his feeling of frustration peaked his certainty leaked away perhaps it had not been a magical sound after all perhaps he wa so desperate for the tiniest sign of contact from the world to which he belonged that he wa simply overreacting to perfectly ordinary noise could he be sure it had not been the sound of something breaking inside a neighbor house harry felt a dull sinking sensation in his stomach and before he knew it the feeling of hopelessness that had plagued him all summer rolled over him once again tomorrow morning he would be awoken by the alarm at five of the clock so that he could pay the owl that delivered the daily prophet but wa there any point in continuing to take it harry merely glanced at the front page before throwing it aside these day when the idiot who ran the paper finally realized that voldemort wa back it would be headline news and that wa the only kind harry cared about if he wa lucky there would also be owl carrying letter from his best friend ron and hermione though any expectation he had had that their letter would bring him news had long since been dashed we can not say much about youknowwhat obviously we have been told not to say anything important in case our letter go astray were quite busy but i can not give you detail here there is a fair page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling amount going on well tell you everything when we see you but when were they going to see him nobody seemed too bothered with a precise date hermione had scribbled i expect well be seeing you quite soon inside his birthday card but how soon wa soon a far a harry could tell from the vague hint in their letter hermione and ron were in the same place presumably at ron parent house he could hardly bear to think of the pair of them having fun at the burrow when he wa stuck in privet drive in fact he wa so angry at them that he had thrown both their birthday present of honeydukes chocolate away unopened though he had regretted this after eating the wilting salad aunt petunia had provided for dinner that night and what were ron and hermione busy with why wa not he harry busy had not he proved himself capable of handling much more than they had they all forgotten what he had done had not it been he who had entered that graveyard and watched cedric being murdered and been tied to that tombstone and nearly killed do not think about that harry told himself sternly for the hundredth time that summer it wa bad enough that he kept revisiting the graveyard in his nightmare without dwelling on it in his waking moment too he turned a corner into magnolia crescent halfway along he passed the narrow alleyway down the side of a garage where he had first clapped eye on his godfather sirius at least seemed to understand how harry wa feeling admittedly his letter were just a empty of proper news a ron and hermiones but at page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling least they contained word of caution and consolation instead of tantalizing hint i know this must be frustrating for you keep your nose clean and everything will be okay be careful and do not do anything rash well thought harry a he crossed magnolia crescent turned into magnolia road and headed toward the darkening play park he had by and large done a sirius advised he had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for the burrow by himself in fact harry thought his behavior had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in privet drive this long reduced to hiding in flower bed in the hope of hearing something that might point to what lord voldemort wa doing nevertheless it wa quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve year in the wizard prison azkaban escaped attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass the park wa a empty a the surrounding street when he reached the swing he sank onto the only one that dudley and his friend had not yet managed to break coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground he would not be able to hide in the dursleys flower bed again tomorrow he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news in the meantime he had nothing to look forward to but another restless disturbed night because even when he escaped nightmare about cedric he had unsettling dream about long dark corridor all finishing in dead end and locked door which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he wa awake often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably but he did not fool himself that ron or hermione or sirius would find that very interesting anymore in the past his scar hurting had warned that voldemort wa getting stronger again but now that voldemort wa back they would probably remind him that it regular irritation wa only to be expected nothing to worry about old news the injustice of it all welled up inside him so that he wanted to yell with fury if it had not been for him nobody would even have known voldemort wa back and his reward wa to be stuck in little whinging for four solid week completely cut off from the magical world reduced to squatting among dying begonia so that he could hear about waterskiing budgerigar how could dumbledore have forgotten him so easily why had ron and hermione got together without inviting him along too how much longer wa he supposed to endure sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy or resist the temptation to write to the stupid daily prophet and point out that voldemort had returned these furious thought whirled around in harrys head and his inside writhed with anger a a sultry velvety night fell around him the air full of the smell of warm dry grass and the only sound that of the low grumble of traffic on the road beyond the park railing he did not know how long he had sat on the swing before the sound of voice interrupted his musing and he looked up the streetlamps from the surrounding road were casting a misty glow strong enough to silhouette a group of people making their way across the park one of them wa singing a loud crude song the others were laughing a soft ticking noise came from several expensive racing bike that they were wheeling along page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry knew who those people were the figure in front wa unmistakably his cousin dudley dursley wending his way home accompanied by his faithful gang dudley wa a vast a ever but a year hard dieting and the discovery of a new talent had wrought quite a change in his physique a uncle vernon delightedly told anyone who would listen dudley had recently become the junior heavyweight interschool boxing champion of the southeast the noble sport a uncle vernon called it had made dudley even more formidable than he had seemed to harry in the primary school day when he had served a dudleys first punching bag harry wa not remotely afraid of his cousin anymore but he still did not think that dudley learning to punch harder and more accurately wa because for celebration neighborhood child all around were terrified of him even more terrified than they were of that potter boy who they had been warned wa a hardened hooligan who attended st brutus secure center for incurably criminal boy harry watched the dark figure crossing the grass and wondered whom they had been beating up tonight look round harry found himself thinking a he watched them come on look round i am sitting here all alone come and have ago if dudleys friend saw him sitting here they would be sure to make a beeline for him and what would dudley do then he would not want to lose face in front of the gang but he would be terrified of provoking harry it would be really fun to watch dudleys dilemma to taunt him watch him with him powerless to respond and if any of the others tried hitting harry harry wa ready he had his wand let them try he would love to vent some of his page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling frustration on the boy who had once made his life hell but they did not turn around they did not see him they were almost at the railing harry mastered the impulse to call after them seeking a fight wa not a smart move he must not use magic he would be risking expulsion again dudleys gang voice died they were out of sight heading along magnolia road there you go sirius harry thought dully nothing rash kept my nose clean exactly the opposite of what you would have done he got to his foot and stretched aunt petunia and uncle vernon seemed to feel that whenever dudley turned up wa the right time to be home and anytime after that wa much too late uncle vernon had threatened to lock harry in the she would if he came home after dudley again so stifling a yawn still scowling harry set off toward the park gate magnolia road like privet drive wa full of large square house with perfectly manicured lawn all owned by large square owner who drove very clean car similar to uncle vernons harry preferred little whinging by night when the curtained window made patch of jewelbright color in the darkness and he ran no danger of hearing disapproving mutter about his delinquent appearance when he passed the householder he walked quickly so that halfway along magnolia road dudleys gang came into view again they were saying their farewell at the entrance to magnolia crescent harry stepped into the shadow of a large lilac tree and waited page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling squealed like a pig did not he malcolm wa saying to guffaw from the others nice right hook big d said pier same time tomorrow said dudley round at my place my parent are out said gordon see you then said dudley bye dud see ya big d harry waited for the rest of the gang to move on before setting off again when their voice had faded once more he headed around the corner into magnolia crescent and by walking very quickly he soon came within hailing distance of dudley who wa strolling along at his ease humming tunelessly hey big d dudley turned oh he grunted it you how long have you been big d then said harry shut it snarled dudley turning away again cool name said harry grinning and falling into step beside his cousin but you will always be ickle diddykins to me i said shut it said dudley whose hamlike hand had curled into fist page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling do not the boy know that is what your mum call you shut your face you do not tell her to shut her face what about popkin and dinky diddydums can i use them then dudley said nothing the effort of keeping himself from hitting harry seemed to be demanding all his selfcontrol so who have you been beating up tonight harry asked his grin fading another tenyearold i know you did mark evans two night ago he wa asking for it snarled dudley oh yeah he cheeked me yeah did he say you look like a pig that is been taught to walk on it hind leg because that is not cheek dud that is true a muscle wa twitching in dudleys jaw it gave harry enormous satisfaction to know how furious he wa making dudley he felt a though he wa siphoning off his own frustration into his cousin the only outlet he had they turned right down the narrow alleyway where harry had first seen sirius and which formed a shortcut between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk it wa empty and much darker than the street it linked because there were no streetlamps their page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling footstep were muffled between garage wall on one side and a high fence on the other think you are a big man carrying that thing do not you dudley said after a few second what thing that that thing you are hiding harry grinned again not a stupid a you look are you dud but i spose if you were you would not be able to walk and talk at the same time harry pulled out his wand he saw dudley look sideways at it you are not allowed dudley said at once i know you are not you would get expelled from that freak school you go to how dyou know they have not changed the rule big d they have not said dudley though he did not sound completely convinced harry laughed softly you have not got the gut to take me on without that thing have you dudley snarled whereas you just need four mate behind you before you can beat up a tenyearold you know that boxing title you keep banging on about how old wa your opponent seven eight he wa sixteen for your information snarled dudley and he wa out cold for twenty minute after page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling id finished with him and he wa twice a heavy a you you just wait till i tell dad you had that thing out running to daddy now are you is his ickle boxing champ frightened of nasty harrys wand not this brave at night are you sneered dudley this is night diddykins that is what we call it when it go all dark like this i mean when you are in bed dudley snarled he had stopped walking harry stopped too staring at his cousin from the little he could see of dudleys large face he wa wearing a strangely triumphant look what dyou mean i am not brave in bed said harry completely nonplussed what am i supposed to be frightened of pillow or something i heard you last night said dudley breathlessly talking in your sleep moaning what dyou mean harry said again but there wa a cold plunging sensation in his stomach he had revisited the graveyard last night in his dream dudley gave a harsh bark of laughter then adopted a highpitched whimpering voice do not kill cedric do not kill cedric who is cedric your boyfriend i you are lying said harry automatically but his mouth had gone dry he knew dudley wa not lying how else would he know about cedric page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tad help me dad he going to kill me dad boo hoo shut up said harry quietly shut up dudley i am warning you come and help me dad mum come and help me he killed cedric dad help me he going to do not you point that thing at me dudley backed into the alley wall harry wa pointing the wand directly at dudleys heart harry could feel fourteen year hatred of dudley pounding in his vein what would not he give to strike now to jinx dudley so thoroughly he would have to crawl home like an insect struck dumb sprouting feeler do not ever talk about that again harry snarled dyou understand me point that thing somewhere else i said do you understand me point it somewhere else do you understand me get that thing away from dudley gave an odd shuddering gasp a though he had been doused in icy water something had happened to the night the star strewn indigo sky wa suddenly pitchblack and lightless the star the moon the misty streetlamps at either end of the alley had vanished the distant grumble of car and the whisper of tree had gone the balmy evening wa suddenly piercingly bitingly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling cold they were surrounded by total impenetrable silent darkness a though some giant hand had dropped a thick icy mantle over the entire alleyway blinding them for a split second harry thought he had done magic without meaning to despite the fact that he would been resisting a hard a he could then his reason caught up with his sens he did not have the power to turn off the star he turned his head this way and that trying to see something but the darkness pressed on his eye like a weightless veil dudleys terrified voice broke in harrys ear wwhat are you ddoing ststop it i am not doing anything shut up and do not move i ccant see i have ggone blind i i said shut up harry stood stockstill turning his sightless eye left and right the cold wa so intense that he wa shivering all over goose bump had erupted up his arm and the hair on the back of his neck were standing up he opened his eye to their fullest extent staring blankly around unseeing it wa impossible they could not be here not in little whinging he strained his ear he would hear them before he saw them ill ttell dad dudley whimpered wwhere are you what are you ddo will you shut up harry hissed i am trying to li page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but he fell silent he had heard just the thing he had been dreading there wa something in the alleyway apart from themselves something that wa drawing long hoarse rattling breath harry felt a horrible jolt of dread a he stood trembling in the freezing air ccut it out stop doing it ill hhit you i swear i will dudley shut wham a fist made contact with the side of harrys head lifting harry off his foot small white light popped in front of harrys eye for the second time in an hour he felt a though his head had been cleaved in two next moment he had landed hard on the ground and his wand had flown out of his hand you moron dudley harry yelled his eye watering with pain a he scrambled to his hand and knee now feeling around frantically in the blackness he heard dudley blundering away hitting the alley fence stumbling dudley come back you are running right at it there wa a horrible squealing yell and dudleys footstep stopped at the same moment harry felt a creeping chill behind him that could mean only one thing there wa more than one dudley keep your mouth shut whatever you do keep your mouth shut wand harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling muttered frantically his hand flying over the ground like spider where is wand come on lumosl he said the spell automatically desperate for light to help him in his search and to his disbelieving relief light flared inch from his right hand the wand tip had ignited harry snatched it up scrambled to his foot and turned around his stomach turned over a towering hooded figure wa gliding smoothly toward him hovering over the ground no foot or face visible beneath it robe sucking on the night a it came stumbling backward harry raised his wand expecto patronurrd a silvery wisp of vapor shot from the tip of the wand and the dementor slowed but the spell had not worked properly tripping over his foot harry retreated farther a the dementor bore down upon him panic fogging his brain concentrate a pair of gray slimy scabbed hand slid from inside the dementors robe reaching for him a rushing noise filled harrys ear expecto patronumv his voice sounded dim and distant another wisp of silver smoke feebler than the last drifted from the wand he could not do it anymore he could not work the spell there wa laughter inside his own head shrill high pitched laughter he could smell the dementors page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling putrid deathcold breath filling his own lung drowning him think something happy but there wa no happiness in him the dementors icy finger were closing on his throat the high pitched laughter wa growing louder and louder and a voice spoke inside his head bow to death harry it might even be painless i would not know i have never died he wa never going to see ron and hermione again and their face burst clearly into his mind a he fought for breath expecto patronum an enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of harrys wand it antler caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have been it wa thrown backward weightless a darkness and a the stag charged the dementor swooped away batlike and defeated this way harry shouted at the stag wheeling around he sprinted down the alleyway holding the lit wand aloft dudley dudley he had run barely a dozen step when he reached them dudley wa curled on the ground his arm clamped over his face a second dementor wa crouching low over him gripping his wrist in it slimy hand prizing them slowly almost lovingly apart lowering it hooded head toward dudleys face a though about to kiss him get it harry bellowed and with a rushing roaring sound the silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him the dementors eyeless face wa page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling barely an inch from dudleys when the silver antler caught it the thing wa thrown up into the air and like it fellow it soared away and wa absorbed into the darkness the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist moon star and streetlamps burst back into life a warm breeze swept the alleyway tree rustled in neighboring garden and the mundane rumble of car in magnolia crescent filled the air again harry stood quite still all his sens vibrating taking in the abrupt return to normality after a moment he became aware that his tshirt wa sticking to him he wa drenched in sweat he could not believe what had just happened dementors here in little whinging dudley lay curled up on the ground whimpering and shaking harry bent down to see whether he wa in a fit state to stand up but then heard loud running footstep behind him instinctively raising his wand again he spun on his heel to face the newcomer mr figg their batty old neighbor came panting into sight her grizzled gray hair wa escaping from it hairnet a clanking string shopping bag wa swinging from her wrist and her foot were halfway out of her tartan carpet slipper harry made to stow his wand hurriedly out of sight but do not put it away idiot boy she shrieked what if there are more of them around oh i am going to kill mundungus fletcher page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a peck of owl what said harry blankly he left said mr figg wringing her hand left to see someone about a batch of cauldron that fell off the back of a broom i told him id flay him alive if he went and now look dementors it just lucky i put mr tibbies on the case but we have not got time to stand around hurry now we have got to get you back oh the trouble this is going to cause i will kill him but the revelation that his batty old catobsessed neighbor knew what dementors were wa almost a big a shock to harry a meeting two of them down the alleyway you are you are a witch i am a squib a mundungus know full well so how on earth wa i supposed to help you fight off dementors he left you completely without cover when i warned him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling this bloke mundungus ha been following me hang on it wa him he disapparated from the front of my house yes yes yes but luckily id stationed mr tibbies under a car just in case and mr tibbies came and warned me but by the time i got to your house you would gone and now oh what is dumbledore going to say you she shrieked at dudley still supine on the alley floor get your fat bottom off the ground quick you know dumbledore said harry staring at her of course i know dumbledore who doe not know dumbledore but come on ill be no help if they come back i have never so much a transfigured a teabag she stooped down seized one of dudleys massive arm in her wizened hand and tugged get up you useless lump get up but dudley either could not or would not move he wa still on the ground trembling and ashenfaced his mouth shut very tight ill do it harry took hold of dudleys arm and heaved with an enormous effort he managed to hoist dudley to his foot dudley seemed to be on the point of fainting his small eye were rolling in their socket and sweat wa beading his face the moment harry let go of him he swayed dangerously hurry up said mr figg hysterically harry pulled one of dudleys massive arm around his own shoulder and dragged him toward the road page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sagging slightly under his weight mr figg tottered along in front of them peering anxiously around the corner keep your wand out she told harry a they entered wisteria walk never mind the statute of secrecy now there is going to be hell to pay anyway we might a well be hanged for a dragon a an egg talk about the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery this wa exactly what dumbledore wa afraid of what is that at the end of the street oh it just mr prentice do not put your wand away boy do not i keep telling you i am no use it wa not easy to hold a wand steady and carry dudley along at the same time harry gave his cousin an impatient dig in the rib but dudley seemed to have lost all desire for independent movement he wa slumped on harrys shoulder his large foot dragging along the ground why did not you tell me you are a squib harry asked mr figg panting with the effort to keep walking all those time i came round your house why did not you say anything dumbledore s order i wa to keep an eye on you but not say anything you were too young i am sorry i gave you such a miserable time but the dursleys would never have let you come if they would thought you enjoyed it it wa not easy you know but oh my word she said tragically wringing her hand once more when dumbledore hears about this how could mundungus have left he wa supposed to be on duty until midnight where is he how am i going to tell dumbledore what is happened i can not apparate page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i have got an owl you can borrow her harry groaned wondering whether his spine wa going to snap under dudleys weight harry you do not understand dumbledore will need to act a quickly a possible the ministry have their own way of detecting underage magic they will know already you mark my word but i wa getting rid of dementors i had to use magic they are going to be more worried what dementors were doing floating around wisteria walk surely oh my dear i wish it were so but i am afraid mundungus fletcher i am going to kill you there wa a loud crack and a strong smell of mingled drink and stale tobacco filled the air a a squat unshaven man in a tattered overcoat materialized right in front of them he had short bandy leg long straggly ginger hair and bloodshot baggy eye that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound he wa also clutching a silvery bundle that harry recognized at once a an invisibility cloak s up figgy he said staring from mr figg to harry and dudley what appened to staying undercover ill give you undercover cried mr figg dementors you useless skiving sneak thief dementors repeated mundungus aghast dementors here page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes here you worthless pile of bat droppings here shrieked mr figg

after her he had a million question to ask anyone who wa in contact with dumbledore but within second mr figg wa swallowed by the darkness scowling harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling readjusted dudley on his shoulder and made his slow painful way up number four garden path the hall light wa on harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jean rang the bell and watched aunt petunia outline grow larger and larger oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door diddy about time too i wa getting quite quite diddy what is the matter harry looked sideways at dudley and ducked out from under his arm just in time dudley swayed for a moment on the spot his face pale green then he opened his mouth at last and vomited all over the doormat diddy diddy what is the matter with you vernon vernon harrys uncle came galumphing out of the living room walrus mustache blowing hither and thither a it always did when he wa agitated he hurried forward to help aunt petunia negotiate a weakkneed dudley over the threshold while avoiding stepping in the pool of sick he ill vernon what is it son what is happened did mr polkiss give you something foreign for tea why are you all covered in dirt darling have you been lying on the ground hang on you have not been mugged have you son page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling aunt petunia screamed phone the police vernon phone the police diddy darling speak to mummy what did they do to you in all the kerfuffle nobody seemed to have noticed harry which suited him perfectly he managed to slip inside just before uncle vernon slammed the door and while the dursleys made their noisy progress down the hall toward the kitchen harry moved carefully and quietly toward the stair who did it son give u name well get them do not worry shh he trying to say something vernon what is it diddy tell mummy harrys foot wa on the bottommost stair when dudley found his voice him harry froze foot on the stair face screwed up braced for the explosion boy come here with a feeling of mingled dread and anger harry removed his foot slowly from the stair and turned to follow the dursleys the scrupulously clean kitchen had an oddly unreal glitter after the darkness outside aunt petunia wa ushering dudley into a chair he wa still very green and clammy looking uncle vernon wa standing in front of the draining board glaring at harry through tiny narrowed eye page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what have you done to my son he said in a menacing growl nothing said harry knowing perfectly well that uncle vernon would not believe him what did he do to you diddy aunt petunia said in a quavering voice now sponging sick from the front of dudleys leather jacket wa it wa it youknow what darling did he use his thing slowly tremulously dudley nodded i did not harry said sharply a aunt petunia let out a wail and uncle vernon raised his fist i did not do anything to him it wa not me it wa but at that precise moment a screech owl swooped in through the kitchen window narrowly missing the top of uncle vernons head it soared across the kitchen dropped the large parchment envelope it wa carrying in it beak at harrys foot and turned gracefully the tip of it wing just brushing the top of the fridge then zoomed outside again and off across the garden owl bellowed uncle vernon the wellworn vein in his temple pulsing angrily a he slammed the kitchen window shut owl again i will not have any more owl in my house but harry wa already ripping open the envelope and pulling out the letter inside his heart pounding somewhere in the region of his adam apple dear mr potter we have received intelligence that you performed the patronus charm at twentythree minute past nine this page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling evening in a muggleinhabited area and in the presence of a muggle the severity of this breach of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery ha resulted in your expulsion from hog wart school of witchcraft and wizardry ministry representative will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand a you have already received an official warning for a previous offense under section of the international confederation of wizard statute of secrecy we regret to inform you that your presence is required at a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of magic at a m on august th hoping you are well yours sincerely mafalda hopkirk improper use of magic office ministry of magic harry read the letter through twice he wa only vaguely aware of uncle vernon and aunt petunia talking in the vicinity inside his head all wa icy and numb one fact had penetrated his consciousness like a paralyzing dart he wa expelled from hogwarts it wa all over he wa never going back he looked up at the dursleys uncle vernon wa purplefaced shouting his fist still raised aunt petunia had her arm around dudley who wa retching again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harrys temporarily stupefied brain seemed to reawaken ministry representative will be calling at your place of residence shortly to destroy your wand there wa only one thing for it he would have to run now where he wa going to go harry did not know but he wa certain of one thing at hogwarts or outside it he needed his wand in an almost dreamlike state he pulled his wand out and turned to leave the kitchen where dyou think you are going yelled uncle vernon when harry did not reply he pounded across the kitchen to block the doorway into the hall i have not finished with you boy get out of the way said harry quietly you are going to stay here and explain how my son if you do not get out of the way i am going to jinx you said harry raising the wand you can not pull that one on me snarled uncle vernon i know you are not allowed to use it outside that madhouse you call a school the madhouse ha chucked me out said harry so i can do whatever i like you have got three second one two a resounding crack filled the kitchen aunt petunia screamed uncle vernon yelled and ducked but for the third time that night harry wa staring for the source of a disturbance he had not made he spotted it at once a dazed and ruffledlooking barn owl wa sitting outside on the kitchen sill having just collided with the closed window page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ignoring uncle vernons anguished yell of owl harry crossed the room at a run and wrenched the window open again the owl stuck out it leg to which a small roll of parchment wa tied shook it feather and took off the moment harry had pulled off the letter hand shaking harry unfurled the second message which wa written very hastily and blotchily in black ink harry dumbledores just arrived at the ministry and he trying to sort it all out do not leave your aunt and uncle house do not do anymore magic do not surrender your wand arthur weasley dumbledore wa trying to sort it all out what did that mean how much power did dumbledore have to override the ministry of magic wa there a chance that he might be allowed back to hogwarts then a small shoot of hope burgeoned in harrys chest almost immediately strangled by panic how wa he supposed to refuse to surrender his wand without doing magic he would have to duel with the ministry representative and if he did that he would be lucky to escape azkaban let alone expulsion his mind wa racing he could run for it and risk being captured by the ministry or stay put and wait for them to find him here he wa much more tempted by the former course but he knew that mr weasley had his best interest at heart and after all dumbledore had sorted out much worse than this before right harry said i have changed my mind i am staying page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he flung himself down at the kitchen table and faced dudley and aunt petunia the dursleys appeared taken aback at his abrupt change of mind aunt petunia glanced despairingly at uncle vernon the vein in uncle vernons purple temple wa throbbing worse than ever who are all these ruddy owl from he growled the first one wa from the ministry of magic expelling me said harry calmly he wa straining his ear to catch noise outside in case the ministry representative were approaching and it wa easier and quieter to answer uncle vernons question than to have him start raging and bellowing the second one wa from my friend ron dad he work at the ministry ministry of magic bellowed uncle vernon people like you in government oh this explains everything everything no wonder the country going to the dog when harry did not respond uncle vernon glared at him then spat and why have you been expelled because i did magic aha roared uncle vernon slamming his fist down on the top of the fridge which sprang open several of dudleys lowfat snack toppled out and burst on the floor so you admit it what did you do to dudley nothing said harry slightly le calmly that wa not me wa muttered dudley unexpectedly and uncle vernon and aunt petunia instantly made flapping page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling gesture at harry to quiet him while they both bent low over dudley go on son said uncle vernon what did he do tell u darling whispered aunt petunia pointed his wand at me dudley mumbled yeah i did but i did not use harry began angrily but shut up roared uncle vernon and aunt petunia in unison go on son repeated uncle vernon mustache blowing about furiously all dark dudley said hoarsely shuddering everything dark and then i hheard thing inside mmy head uncle vernon and aunt petunia exchanged look of utter horror if their least favorite thing in the world wa magic closely followed by neighbor who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban people who heard voice were definitely in the bottom ten they obviously thought dudley wa losing his mind what sort of thing did you hear popkin breathed aunt petunia very whitefaced and with tear in her eye but dudley seemed incapable of saying he shuddered again and shook his large blond head and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on harry since the arrival of the first owl he felt a certain curiosity dementors caused a person to relive the worst moment of their life what would spoiled pampered bullying dudley have been forced to hear page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling how come you fell over son said uncle vernon in an unnaturally quiet voice the kind of voice he would adopt at the bedside of a very ill person ttripped said dudley shakily and then he gestured at his massive chest harry understood dudley wa remembering the clammy cold that filled the lung a hope and happiness were sucked out of you horrible croaked dudley cold really cold okay said uncle vernon in a voice of forced calm while aunt petunia laid an anxious hand on dudleys forehead to feel his temperature what happened then dudders felt felt felt a if a if a if you would never be happy again harry supplied tonelessly yes dudley whispered still trembling so said uncle vernon voice restored to full and considerable volume a he straightened up so you put some crackpot spell on my son so he would hear voice and believe he wa wa doomed to misery or something did you how many time do i have to tell you said harry temper and voice rising together it wa not me it wa a couple of dementors a couple of what is this codswallop de men tor said harry slowly and clearly two of them page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and what the ruddy hell are dementors they guard the wizard prison azkaban said aunt petunia two second ringing silence followed these word and then aunt petunia clapped her hand over her mouth a though she had let slip a disgusting swear word uncle vernon wa goggling at her harrys brain reeled mr figg wa one thing but aunt petunia how dyou know that he asked her astonished aunt petunia looked quite appalled with herself she glanced at uncle vernon in fearful apology then lowered her hand slightly to reveal her horsey teeth i heard that awful boy telling her about them year ago she said jerkily if you mean my mum and dad why do not you use their name said harry loudly but aunt petunia ignored him she seemed horribly flustered harry wa stunned except for one outburst year ago in the course of which aunt petunia had screamed that harrys mother had been a freak he had never heard her mention her sister he wa astounded that she had remembered this scrap of information about the magical world for so long when she usually put all her energy into pretending it did not exist uncle vernon opened his mouth closed it again opened it once more shut it then apparently struggling to remember how to talk opened it for a third time and croaked so so they er they er they actually exist do they er dementy whatsits page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling aunt petunia nodded uncle vernon looked from aunt petunia to dudley to harry a if hoping somebody wa going to shout april fool when nobody did he opened his mouth yet again but wa spared the struggle to find more word by the arrival of the third owl of the evening which zoomed through the stillopen window like a feathery cannonball and landed with a clatter on the kitchen table causing all three of the dursleys to jump with fright harry tore a second officiallooking envelope from the owl beak and ripped it open a the owl swooped back out into the night enough effing owl muttered uncle vernon distractedly stomping over to the window and slamming it shut again dear mr potter further to our letter of approximately twentytwo minute ago the ministry of magic ha revised it decision to destroy your wand forthwith you may retain your wand until your disciplinary hearing on th august at which time an official decision will be taken following discussion with the headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the ministry ha agreed that the question of your expulsion will also be decided at that time you should therefore consider yourself suspended from school pending further inquiry with best wish yours sincerely mafalda hopkirk page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling improper use of magic office ministry of magic harry read this letter through three time in quick succession the miserable knot in his chest loosened slightly at the thought that he wa not definitely expelled though his fear were by no mean banished everything seemed to hang on this hearing on the twelfth of august well said uncle vernon recalling harry to his surroundings what now have they sentenced you to anything do your lot have the death penalty he added a a hopeful afterthought i have got to go to a hearing said harry and they will sentence you there i suppose so i will not give up hope then said uncle vernon nastily well if that is all said harry getting to his foot he wa desperate to be alone to think perhaps to send a letter to ron hermione or sirius no it ruddy well is not all bellowed uncle vernon sit back down what now said harry impatiently dudley roared uncle vernon i want to know exactly what happened to my son fine yelled harry and in his temper red and gold spark shot out of the end of his wand still clutched page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling in his hand all three dursleys flinched looking terrified dudley and i were in the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk said harry speaking fast fighting to control his temper dudley thought he would be smart with me i pulled out my wand but did not use it then two dementors turned up but what are dementoids asked uncle vernon furiously what do they do i told you they suck all the happiness out of you said harry and if they get the chance they kiss you kiss you said uncle vernon his eye popping slightly kiss you it what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth aunt petunia uttered a soft scream his soul they did not take he still got his she seized dudley by the shoulder and shook him a though testing to see whether she could hear his soul rattling around inside him of course they did not get his soul you would know if they had said harry exasperated fought them off did you son said uncle vernon loudly with the appearance of a man struggling to bring the conversation back onto a plane he understood gave them the old onetwo did you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you can not give a dementor the old onetwo said harry through clenched teeth why is he all right then blustered uncle vernon why is not he all empty then because i used the patronus whoosh with a clattering a whirring of wing and a soft fall of dust a fourth owl came shooting out of the kitchen fireplace for god sake roared uncle vernon pulling great clump of hair out of his mustache something he had not been driven to in a long time i will not have owl here i will not tolerate this i tell you but harry wa already pulling a roll of parchment from the owl leg he wa so convinced that this letter had to be from dumbledore explaining everything the dementors mr figg what the ministry wa up to how he dumbledore intended to sort everything out that for the first time in his life he wa disappointed to see sirius handwriting ignoring uncle vernons ongoing rant about owl and narrowing his eye against a second cloud of dust a the most recent owl took off back up the chimney harry read sirius message arthur just told u what is happened do not leave the house again whatever you do harry found this such an inadequate response to everything that had happened tonight that he turned the piece of parchment over looking for the rest of the letter but there wa nothing there page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and now his temper wa rising again wa not anybody going to say well done for fighting off two dementors singlehandedly both mr weasley and sirius were acting a though he would misbehaved and they were saving their tellingsoff until they could ascertain how much damage had been done a peck i mean pack of owl shooting in and out of my house and i will not have it boy i will not i can not stop the owl coming harry snapped crushing sirius letter in his fist i want the truth about what happened tonight barked uncle vernon if it wa demenders who hurt dudley how come you have been expelled you did you knowwhat you have admitted it harry took a deep steadying breath his head wa beginning to ache again he wanted more than anything to get out of the kitchen away from the dursleys i did the patronus charm to get rid of the dementors he said forcing himself to remain calm it the only thing that work against them but what were dementoids doing in little whinging said uncle vernon in tone of outrage could not tell you said harry wearily no idea his head wa pounding in the glare of the strip lighting now his anger wa ebbing away he felt drained exhausted the dursleys were all staring at him it you said uncle vernon forcefully it got something to do with you boy i know it why else page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling would they turn up here why else would they be down that alleyway you have got to be the only the only evidently he could not bring himself to say the word wizard the only youknowwhat for mile i do not know why they were here but at these word of uncle vernons harrys exhausted brain ground back into action why had the dementors come to little whinging how could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where harry wa had they been sent had the ministry of magic lost control of the dementors had they deserted azkaban and joined voldemort a dumbledore had predicted they would these demembers guard some weirdo prison said uncle vernon lumbering in the wake of harrys train of thought yes said harry if only his head would stop hurting if only he could just leave the kitchen and get to his dark bedroom and think oho they were coming to arrest you said uncle vernon with the triumphant air of a man reaching an unassailable conclusion that is it is not it boy you are on the run from the law of course i am not said harry shaking his head a though to scare off a fly his mind racing now then why he must have sent them said harry quietly more to himself than to uncle vernon page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what is that who must have sent them lord voldemort said harry he registered dimly how strange it wa that the dursleys who flinched winced and squawked if they heard word like wizard magic or wand could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor lord hang on said uncle vernon his face screwed up a look of dawning comprehension in his piggy eye i have heard that name that wa the one who murdered my parent yes harry said but he gone said uncle vernon impatiently without the slightest sign that the murder of harrys parent might be a painful topic to anybody that giant bloke said so he gone he back said harry heavily it felt very strange to be standing here in aunt petunia surgically clean kitchen beside the topof therange fridge and the widescreen television and talking calmly of lord voldemort to uncle vernon the arrival of the dementors in little whinging seemed to have caused a breach in the great invisible wall that divided the relentlessly nonmagical world of privet drive and the world beyond harrys two life had somehow become fused and everything had been turned upside down the dursleys were asking for detail about the magical world and mr figg knew albus dumbledore dementors were soaring around little whinging and he might never go back to hogwarts harrys head throbbed more painfully page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling back whispered aunt petunia she wa looking at harry a she had never looked at him before and all of a sudden for the very first time in his life harry fully appreciated that aunt petunia wa his mother sister he could not have said why this hit him so very powerfully at this moment all he knew wa that he wa not the only person in the room who had an inkling of what lord voldemort being back might mean aunt petunia had never in her life looked at him like that before her large pale eye so unlike her sister were not narrowed in dislike or anger they were wide and fearful the furious pretense that aunt petunia had maintained all harrys life that there wa no magic and no world other than the world she inhabited with uncle vernon seemed to have fallen away yes harry said talking directly to aunt petunia now he came back a month ago i saw him her hand found dudleys massive leatherclad shoulder and clutched them hang on said uncle vernon looking from his wife to harry and back again apparently dazed and confused by the unprecedented understanding that seemed to have sprung up between them hang on this lord voldythings back you say yes the one who murdered your parent yes and now he sending dismembers after you look like it said harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i see said uncle vernon looking from his white faced wife to harry and hitching up his trouser he seemed to be swelling his great purple face stretching before harrys eye well that settle it he said his shirt front straining a he inflated himself you can get out of this house boy what said harry you heard me out uncle vernon bellowed and even aunt petunia and dudley jumped out out i should have done it year ago owl treating the place like a rest home pudding exploding half the lounge destroyed dudleys tail marge bobbing around on the ceiling and that flying ford anglia out out you have had it you are history you are not staying here if some loony after you you are not endangering my wife and son you are not bringing trouble down on u if you are going the same way a your useless parent i have had it out harry stood rooted to the spot the letter from the ministry mr weasley and sirius were crushed in his left hand do not leave the house again whatever you do do not lea ve your a unt and uncle house you heard me said uncle vernon bending forward now so that his massive purple face came closer to harrys so that harry actually felt fleck of spit hit his face get going you were all keen to leave half an hour ago i am right behind you get out and never darken our doorstep again why we ever kept you in the first place i do not know marge wa right it should have been the orphanage we were too damn soft for our own good thought we could squash it out of you thought we could turn you normal but you have been rotten from the beginning and i have had enough owl page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the fifth owl zoomed down the chimney so fast it actually hit the floor before zooming into the air again with a loud screech harry raised his hand to seize the letter which wa in a scarlet envelope but it soared straight over his head flying directly at aunt petunia who let out a scream and ducked her arm over her face the owl dropped the red envelope on her head turned and flew straight up the chimney again harry darted forward to pick up the letter but aunt petunia beat him to it you can open it if you like said harry but ill hear what it say anyway that is a howler let go of it petunia roared uncle vernon do not touch it it could be dangerous it addressed to me said aunt petunia in a shaking voice it addressed to me vernon look mr petunia dursley the kitchen number four privet drive she caught her breath horrified the red envelope had begun to smoke open it harry urged her get it over with it will happen anyway no aunt petunia hand wa trembling she looked wildly around the kitchen a though looking for an escape route but too late the envelope burst into flame aunt petunia screamed and dropped it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling an awful voice filled the kitchen echoing in the confined space issuing from the burning letter on the table remember my last petunia aunt petunia looked a though she might faint she sank into the chair beside dudley her face in her hand the remains of the envelope smoldered into ash in the silence what is this uncle vernon said hoarsely what i do not petunia aunt petunia said nothing dudley wa staring stupidly at his mother his mouth hanging open the silence spiraled horribly harry wa watching his aunt utterly bewildered his head throbbing fit to burst petunia dear said uncle vernon timidly p petunia she raised her head she wa still trembling she swallowed the boy the boy will have to stay vernon she said weakly wwhat he stay she said she wa not looking at harry she got to her foot again he but petunia if we throw him out the neighbor will talk she said she wa regaining her usual brisk snappish manner rapidly though she wa still very pale page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they will ask awkward question they will want to know where he gone well have to keep him uncle vernon wa deflating like an old tire but petunia dear aunt petunia ignored him she turned to harry you are to stay in your room she said you are not to leave the house now get to bed harry did not move who wa that howler from do not ask question aunt petunia snapped are you in touch with wizard i told you to get to bed what did it mean remember the last what go to bed how come you heard your aunt now get to bed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the advanced guard fve just been attacked by dementors and i might be expelled from hogwarts i want to know what is going on and when i am going to get out of here harry copied these word onto three separate piece of parchment the moment he reached the desk in his dark bedroom he addressed the first to sirius the second to ron and the third to hermione his owl hedwig wa off hunting her cage stood empty on the desk harry paced the bedroom waiting for her to come back his head pounding his brain too busy for sleep even though his eye stung and itched with tiredness his back ached from carrying dudley home and the two lump on his head where the window and dudley had hit him were throbbing painfully up and down he paced consumed with anger and frustration grinding his teeth and clenching his fist casting angry look out at the empty starstrewn sky every time he passed the window dementors sent to get him mr figg and mundungus fletcher tailing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling him in secret then suspension from hogwarts and a hearing at the ministry of magic and still no one wa telling him what wa going on and what what had that howler been about whose voice had echoed so horribly so menacingly through the kitchen why wa he still trapped here without information why wa everyone treating him like some naughty kid do not do any more magic stay in the house he kicked his school trunk a he passed it but far from relieving his anger he felt worse a he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body just a he limped past the window hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wing like a small ghost about time harry snarled a she landed lightly on top of her cage you can put that down i have got work for you hedwigs large round amber eye gazed reproachfully at him over the dead frog clamped in her beak come here said harry picking up the three small roll of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scroll to her scaly leg take these straight to sirius ron and hermione and do not come back here without good long reply keep pecking them till they have written decentlength answer if you have got to understand hedwig gave a muffled hooting noise beak still full of frog page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling get going then said harry she took off immediately the moment she would gone harry threw himself down onto his bed without undressing and stared at the dark ceiling in addition to every other miserable feeling he now felt guilty that he would been irritable with hedwig she wa the only friend he had at number four privet drive but he would make it up to her when she came back with sirius ron and hermiones answer they were bound to write back quickly they could not possibly ignore a dementor attack he would probably wake up tomorrow to three fat letter full of sympathy and plan for his immediate removal to the burrow and with that comforting idea sleep rolled over him stifling all further thought k jc k but hedwig did not return next morning harry spent the day in his bedroom leaving it only to go to the bathroom three time that day aunt petunia shoved food into his room through the cat flap uncle vernon had installed three summer ago every time harry heard her approaching he tried to question her about the howler but he might a well have interrogated the doorknob for all the answer he got otherwise the dursleys kept well clear of his bedroom harry could not see the point of forcing his company on them another row would achieve nothing except perhaps making him so angry he would perform more illegal magic so it went on for three whole day harry wa filled alternately with restless energy that made him unable to settle to anything during which he paced his bedroom again furious at the whole lot of them for page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling leaving him to stew in this mess and with a lethargy so complete that he could lie on his bed for an hour at a time staring dazedly into space aching with dread at the thought of the ministry hearing what if they ruled against him what if he wa expelled and his wand wa snapped in half what would he do where would he go he could not return to living fulltime with the dursleys not now that he knew the other world the one to which he really belonged wa it possible that he might be able to move into sirius house a sirius had suggested a year ago before he had been forced to flee from the ministry himself would he be allowed to live there alone given that he wa still underage or would the matter of where he went next be decided for him had his breach of the international statute of secrecy been severe enough to land him in a cell in azkaban whenever this thought occurred harry invariably slid off his bed and began pacing again on the fourth night after hedwigs departure harry wa lying in one of his apathetic phase staring at the ceiling his exhausted mind quite blank when his uncle entered his bedroom harry looked slowly around at him uncle vernon wa wearing his best suit and an expression of enormous smugness were going out he said sorry we that is to say your aunt dudley and i are going out fine said harry dully looking back at the ceiling you are not to leave your bedroom while we are away page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling okay you are not to touch the television the stereo or any of our possession right you are not to steal food from the fridge okay i am going to lock your door you do that uncle vernon glared at harry clearly suspicious of this lack of argument then stomped out of the room and closed the door behind him harry heard the key turn in the lock and uncle vernons footstep walking heavily down the stair a few minute later he heard the slamming of car door the rumble of an engine and the unmistakable sound of the car sweeping out of the drive harry had no particular feeling about the dursleys leaving it made no difference to him whether they were in the house or not he could not even summon the energy to get up and turn on his bedroom light the room grew steadily darker around him a he lay listening to the night sound through the window he kept open all the time waiting for the blessed moment when hedwig returned the empty house creaked around him the pipe gurgled harry lay there in a kind of stupor thinking of nothing suspended in misery and then quite distinctly he heard a crash in the kitchen below page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he sat bolt upright listening intently the dursleys could not be back it wa much too soon and in any case he had not heard their car there wa silence for a few second and then he heard voice burglar he thought sliding off the bed onto his foot but a split second later it occurred to him that burglar would keep their voice down and whoever wa moving around in the kitchen wa certainly not troubling to do so he snatched up his wand from his bedside table and stood facing his bedroom door listening with all his might next moment he jumped a the lock gave a loud click and his door swung open harry stood motionless staring through the open door at the dark upstairs landing straining his ear for further sound but none came he hesitated for a moment and then moved swiftly and silently out of his room to the head of the stair his heart shot upward into his throat there were people standing in the shadowy hall below silhouetted against the streetlight glowing through the glass door eight or nine of them all a far a he could see looking up at him lower your wand boy before you take someone is eye out said a low growling voice harrys heart wa thumping uncontrollably he knew that voice but he did not lower his wand professor moody he said uncertainly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i do not know so much about professor growled the voice never got round to much teaching did i get down here we want to see you properly harry lowered his wand slightly but did not relax his grip on it nor did he move he had very good reason to be suspicious he had recently spent nine month in what he had thought wa madeye moody company only to find out that it wa not moody at all but an impostor an impostor moreover who had tried to kill harry before being unmasked but before he could make a decision about what to do next a second slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs it all right harry we have come to take you away harrys heart leapt he knew that voice too though he had not heard it for more than a year pprofessor lupin he said disbelievingly is that you why are we all standing in the dark said a third voice this one completely unfamiliar a woman lumos a wand tip flared illuminating the hall with magical light harry blinked the people below were crowded around the foot of the stair gazing intently up at him some craning their head for a better look remus lupin stood nearest to him though still quite young lupin looked tired and rather ill he had more gray hair than when harry had said goodbye to him and his robe were more patched and shabbier than ever nevertheless he wa smiling broadly at harry who tried to smile back through his shock page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oooh he look just like i thought he would said the witch who wa holding her lit wand aloft she looked the youngest there she had a pale heartshaped face dark twinkling eye and short spiky hair that wa a violent shade of violet wotcher harry yeah i see what you mean remus said a bald black wizard standing farthest back he had a deep slow voice and wore a single gold hoop in his ear he look exactly like james except the eye said a wheezyvoiced silverhaired wizard at the back lily eye madeye moody who had long grizzled gray hair and a large chunk missing from his nose wa squinting suspiciously at harry through his mismatched eye one of the eye wa small dark and beady the other large round and electric blue the magical eye that could see through wall door and the back of moody own head are you quite sure it him lupin he growled it would be a nice lookout if we bring back some death eater impersonating him we ought to ask him something only the real potter would know unless anyone brought any veritaserum harry what form doe your patronus take said lupin a stag said harry nervously that is him madeye said lupin harry descended the stair very conscious of everybody still staring at him stowing his wand into the back pocket of his jean a he came page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling do not put your wand there boy roared moody what if it ignited better wizard than you have lost buttock you know who dyou know who is lost a buttock the violet haired woman asked madeye interestedly never you mind you just keep your wand out of your back pocket growled madeye elementary wand safety nobody bother about it anymore he stumped off toward the kitchen and i saw that he added irritably a the woman rolled her eye at the ceiling lupin held out his hand and shook harrys how are you he asked looking at harry closely ffine harry could hardly believe this wa real four week with nothing not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from privet drive and suddenly a whole bunch of wizard wa standing matteroffactly in the house a though this were a longstanding arrangement he glanced at the people surrounding lupin they were still gazing avidly at him he felt very conscious of the fact that he had not combed his hair for four day i am you are really lucky the dursleys are out he mumbled lucky ha said the violethaired woman it wa me that lured them out of the way sent a letter by muggle post telling them they would been shortlisted for the allengland bestkept suburban lawn competition they are heading off to the prizegiving right now or they think they are page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry had a fleeting vision of uncle vernons face when he realized there wa no allengland bestkept suburban lawn competition we are leaving are not we he asked soon almost at once said lupin were just waiting for the allclear where are we going the burrow harry asked hopefully not the burrow no said lupin motioning harry toward the kitchen the little knot of wizard followed all still eyeing harry curiously too risky we have set up headquarters somewhere undetectable it taken a while madeye moody wa now sitting at the kitchen table swigging from a hip flask his magical eye spinning in all direction taking in the dursleys many labor saving appliance this is alastor moody harry lupin continued pointing toward moody yeah i know said harry uncomfortably it felt odd to be introduced to somebody he would thought he would known for a year and this is nymphadora do not call me nymphadora remus said the young witch with a shudder it tonks nymphadora tonks who prefers to be known by her surname only finished lupin page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling so would you if your fool of a mother had called you nymphadora muttered tonks and this is kingsley shacklebolt he indicated the tall black wizard who bowed elphias doge the wheezyvoiced wizard nodded dedalus diggle we have met before squeaked the excitable diggle dropping his top hat emmeline vance a stately looking witch in an emeraldgreen shawl inclined her head sturgis podmore a squarejawed wizard with thick straw colored hair winked and hestia jones a pink cheeked blackhaired witch waved from next to the toaster harry inclined his head awkwardly at each of them a they were introduced he wished they would look at something other than him it wa a though he had suddenly been ushered onstage he also wondered why so many of them were there a surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you said lupin a though he had read harrys mind the corner of his mouth twitched slightly yeah well the more the better said moody darkly were your guard potter were just waiting for the signal to tell u it safe to set off said lupin glancing out of the kitchen window we have got about fifteen minute very clean are not they these muggles said the witch called tonks who wa looking around the kitchen with great interest my dad muggleborn page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and he a right old slob i suppose it varies just like with wizard er yeah said harry look he turned back to lupin what is going on i have not heard anything from anyone what is vol several of the witch and wizard made odd hissing noise dedalus diggle dropped his hat again and moody growled shut up what said harry were not discussing anything here it too risky said moody turning his normal eye on harry his magical eye remained pointing up at the ceiling damn it he added angrily putting a hand up to the magical eye it keep sticking ever since that scum wore it and with a nasty squelching sound much like a plunger being pulled from a sink he popped out his eye madeye you do know that is disgusting do not you said tonks conversationally get me a glass of water would you harry asked moody harry crossed to the dishwasher took out a clean glass and filled it with water at the sink still watched eagerly by the band of wizard their relentless staring wa starting to annoy him cheer said moody when harry handed him the glass he dropped the magical eyeball into the water and prodded it up and down the eye whizzed around page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling staring at them all in turn i want threehundred andsixty degree visibility on the return journey how are we getting wherever were going harry asked broom said lupin only way you are too young to apparate they will be watching the floo network and it more than our life worth to set up an unauthorized portkey remus say you are a good flier said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep voice he excellent said lupin who wa checking his watch anyway you would better go and get packed harry we want to be ready to go when the signal come ill come and help you said tonks brightly she followed harry back into the hall and up the stair looking around with much curiosity and interest funny place she said it a bit too clean dyou know what i mean bit unnatural oh this is better she added a they entered harrys bedroom and he turned on the light his room wa certainly much messier than the rest of the house confined to it for four day in a very bad mood harry had not bothered tidying up after himself most of the book he owned were strewn over the floor where he would tried to distract himself with each in turn and thrown it aside hedwigs cage needed cleaning out and wa starting to smell and his trunk lay open revealing a jumbled mixture of muggle page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling clothes and wizard robe that had spilled onto the floor around it harry started picking up book and throwing them hastily into his trunk tonks paused at his open wardrobe to look critically at her reflection in the mirror on the inside of the door you know i do not think purple really my color she said pensively tugging at a lock of spiky hair dyou think it make me look a bit peaky er said harry looking up at her over the top of quidditch team of britain and ireland yeah it doe said tonks decisively she screwed up her eye in a strained expression a though she were struggling to remember something a second later her hair had turned bubblegum pink how did you do that said harry gaping at her a she opened her eye again i am a metamorphmagus she said looking back at her reflection and turning her head so that she could see her hair from all direction it mean i can change my appearance at will she added spotting harrys puzzled expression in the mirror behind her i wa born one i got top mark in concealment and disguise during auror training without any study at all it wa great you are an auror said harry impressed being a dark wizard catcher wa the only career he would ever considered after hogwarts yeah said tonks looking proud kingsley is a well he a bit higher up than i am though i only qualified a year ago nearly failed on stealth and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tracking i am dead clumsy did you hear me break that plate when we arrived downstairs can you learn how to be a metamorphmagus harry asked her straightening up completely forgetting about packing tonks chuckled bet you would not mind hiding that scar sometimes eh her eye found the lightningshaped scar on harrys forehead no i would not mind harry mumbled turning away he did not like people staring at his scar well you have to learn the hard way i am afraid said tonks metamorphmagi are really rare they are born not made most wizard need to use a wand or potion to change their appearance but we have got to get going harry were supposed to be packing she added guiltily looking around at all the mess on the floor oh yeah said harry grabbing up a few more book do not be stupid it will be much quicker if i pack cried tonks waving her wand in a long sweeping movement over the floor book clothes telescope and scale all soared into the air and flew pellmell into the trunk it not very neat said tonks walking over to the trunk and looking down at the jumble inside my mum got this knack of getting stuff to fit itself in page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling neatly she even get the sock to fold themselves but i have never mastered how she doe it it a kind of flick she flicked her wand hopefully one of harrys sock gave a feeble sort of wiggle and flopped back on top of the mess within ah well said tonks slamming the trunk lid shut at least it all in that could do with a bit of cleaning too scourgify she pointed her wand at hedwigs cage a few feather and droppings vanished well that is a bit better i have never quite got the hang of these sort of householdy spell right got everything cauldron broom wow a firebolt her eye widened a they fell on the broomstick in harrys right hand it wa his pride and joy a gift from sirius an international standard broomstick and i am still riding a comet two sixty said tonks enviously ah well wand still in your jean both buttock still on okay let u go locomotor trunk harrys trunk rose a few inch into the air holding her wand like a conductor baton tonks made it hover across the room and out of the door ahead of them hedwigs cage in her left hand harry followed her down the stair carrying his broomstick back in the kitchen moody had replaced his eye which wa spinning so fast after it cleaning it made harry feel sick kingsley shacklebolt and sturgis podmore were examining the microwave and hestia jones wa laughing at a potato peeler she had come across while rummaging in the drawer lupin wa sealing a letter addressed to the dursleys page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling excellent said lupin looking up a tonks and harry entered we have got about a minute i think we should probably get out into the garden so were ready harry i have left a letter telling your aunt and uncle not to worry they will not said harry that you are safe that will just depress them and you will see them next summer do i have to lupin smiled but made no answer come here boy said moody gruffly beckoning harry toward him with his wand i need to disillusion you you need to what said harry nervously disillusionment charm said moody raising his wand lupin say you have got an invisibility cloak but it will not stay on while were flying this will disguise you better here you go he rapped harry hard on the top of the head and harry felt a curious sensation a though moody had just smashed an egg there cold trickle seemed to be running down his body from the point the wand had struck nice one madeye said tonks appreciatively staring at harrys midriff page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry looked down at his body or rather what had been his body for it did not look anything like his anymore it wa not invisible it had simply taken on the exact color and texture of the kitchen unit behind him he seemed to have become a human chameleon come on said moody unlocking the back door with his wand they all stepped outside onto uncle vernons beautifully kept lawn clear night grunted moody his magical eye scanning the heaven could have done with a bit more cloud cover right you he barked at harry were going to be flying in close formation tonksll be right in front of you keep close on her tail lupinll be covering you from below i am going to be behind you the restll be circling u we do not break rank for anything got me if one of u is killed is that likely harry asked apprehensively but moody ignored him the others keep flying do not stop do not break rank if they take out all of u and you survive harry the rear guard are standing by to take over keep flying east and they will join you stop being so cheerful madeye hell think were not taking this seriously said tonks a she strapped harrys trunk and hedwigs cage into a harness hanging from her broom i am just telling the boy the plan growled moody our job to deliver him safely to headquarters and if we die in the attempt page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no one going to die said kingsley shacklebolt in his deep calming voice mount your broom that is the first signal said lupin sharply pointing into the sky far far above them a shower of bright red spark had flared among the star harry recognized them at once a wand spark he swung his right leg over his firebolt gripped it handle tightly and felt it vibrating very slightly a though it wa a keen a he wa to be up in the air once more second signal let u go said lupin loudly a more spark green this time exploded high above them harry kicked off hard from the ground the cool night air rushed through his hair a the neat square garden of privet drive fell away shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark green and black and every thought of the ministry hearing wa swept from his mind a though the rush of air had blown it out of his head he felt a though his heart wa going to explode with pleasure he wa flying again flying away from privet drive a he would been fantasizing about all summer he wa going home for a few glorious moment all his problem seemed to recede into nothing insignificant in the vast starry sky hard left hard left there is a muggle looking up shouted moody from behind him tonks swerved and harry followed her watching his trunk swinging wildly beneath her broom we need more height give it another quarter of a mile harrys eye watered in the chill a they soared upward he could see nothing below now but tiny pinprick of light that were car headlight and streetlamps two of those tiny light might belong to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling uncle vernons car the dursleys would be heading back to their empty house right now full of rage about the nonexistent lawn competition and harry laughed aloud at the thought though his voice wa drowned by the flapping of the others robe the creaking of the harness holding his trunk and the cage the whoosh of the wind in their ear a they sped through the air he had not felt this alive in a month or this happy bearing south shouted madeye town ahead they soared right so that they did not pas directly over the glittering spiderweb of light below bear southeast and keep climbing there is some low cloud ahead we can lose ourselves in called moody were not going through cloud shouted tonks angrily well get soaked madeye harry wa relieved to hear her say this his hand were growing numb on the firebolts handle he wished he had thought to put on a coat he wa starting to shiver they altered their course every now and then according to madeye s instruction harrys eye were screwed up against the rush of icy wind that wa starting to make his ear ache he could remember being this cold on a broom only once before during the quidditch match against hufflepuff in his third year which had taken place in a storm the guard around him wa circling continuously like giant bird of prey harry lost track of time he wondered how long they had been flying it felt like an hour at least page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling turning southwest yelled moody we want to avoid the motorway harry wa now so chilled that he thought longingly for a moment of the snug dry interior of the car streaming along below then even more longingly of traveling by floo powder it might be uncomfortable to spin around in fireplace but it wa at least warm in the flame kingsley shacklebolt swooped around him bald pate and earring gleaming slightly in the moonlight now emmeline vance wa on his right her wand out her head turning left and right then she too swooped over him to be replaced by sturgis podmore we ought to double back for a bit just to make sure were not being followed moody shouted are you mad madeye tonks screamed from the front were all frozen to our broom if we keep going off course were not going to get there until next week were nearly there now time to start the descent came lupin voice follow tonks harry harry followed tonks into a dive they were heading for the largest collection of light he had yet seen a huge sprawling crisscrossing mass glittering in line and grid interspersed with patch of deepest black lower and lower they flew until harry could see individual headlight and streetlamps chimney and television aerial he wanted to reach the ground very much though he felt sure that someone would have to unfreeze him from his broom here we go called tonks and a few second later she had landed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry touched down right behind her and dismounted on a patch of unkempt grass in the middle of a small square tonks wa already unbuckling harrys trunk shivering harry looked around the grimy front of the surrounding house were not welcoming some of them had broken window glimmering dully in the light from the streetlamps paint wa peeling from many of the door and heap of rubbish lay outside several set of front step where are we harry asked but lupin said quietly in a minute moody wa rummaging in his cloak his gnarled hand clumsy with cold got it he muttered raising what looked like a silver cigarette lighter into the air and clicking it the nearest streetlamp went out with a pop he clicked the unlighter again the next lamp went out he kept clicking until every lamp in the square wa extinguished and the only light in the square came from curtained window and the sickle moon overhead borrowed it from dumbledore growled moody pocketing the putouter that will take care of any muggles looking out of the window see now come on quick he took harry by the arm and led him from the patch of grass across the road and onto the pavement lupin and tonks followed carrying harrys trunk between them the rest of the guard all with their wand out flanking them page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the muffled pounding of a stereo wa coming from an upper window in the nearest house a pungent smell of rotting rubbish came from the pile of bulging bin bag just inside the broken gate here moody muttered thrusting a piece of parchment toward harrys disillusioned hand and holding his lit wand close to it so a to illuminate the writing read quickly and memorize harry looked down at the piece of paper the narrow handwriting wa vaguely familiar it said the headquarters of the order of the phoenix may he found at number twelve grimmauld place london page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling number twelve grimmauld place what is the order of the harry began not here boy snarled moody wait till were inside he pulled the piece of parchment out of harrys hand and set fire to it with his wand tip a the message curled into flame and floated to the ground harry looked around at the house again they were standing outside number eleven he looked to the left and saw number ten to the right however wa number thirteen but where is think about what you have just memorized said lupin quietly harry thought and no sooner had he reached the part about number twelve grimmauld place than a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling battered door emerged out of nowhere between number eleven and thirteen followed swiftly by dirty wall and grimy window it wa a though an extra house had inflated pushing those on either side out of it way harry gaped at it the stereo in number eleven thudded on apparently the muggles inside had not even felt anything come on hurry growled moody prodding harry in the back harry walked up the worn stone step staring at the newly materialized door it black paint wa shabby and scratched the silver door knocker wa in the form of a twisted serpent there wa no keyhole or letterbox lupin pulled out his wand and tapped the door once harry heard many loud metallic click and what sounded like the clatter of a chain the door creaked open get in quick harry lupin whispered but do not go far inside and do not touch anything harry stepped over the threshold into the almost total darkness of the hall he could smell damp dust and a sweetish rotting smell the place had the feeling of a derelict building he looked over his shoulder and saw the others filing in behind him lupin and tonks carrying his trunk and hedwigs cage moody wa standing on the top step and releasing the ball of light the putouter had stolen from the streetlamps they flew back to their bulb and the square beyond glowed momentarily with orange light before moody limped inside and closed the front door so that the darkness in the hall became complete here page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he rapped harry hard over the head with his wand harry felt a though something hot wa trickling down his back this time and knew that the disillusionment charm must have lifted now stay still everyone while i give u a bit of light in here moody whispered the others hushed voice were giving harry an odd feeling of foreboding it wa a though they had just entered the house of a dying person he heard a soft hissing noise and then oldfashioned gas lamp sputtered into life all along the wall casting a flickering insubstantial light over the peeling wallpaper and threadbare carpet of a long gloomy hallway where a cobwebby chandelier glimmered overhead and ageblackened portrait hung crooked on the wall harry heard something scuttling behind the baseboard both the chandelier and the candelabra on a rickety table nearby were shaped like serpent there were hurried footstep and ron mother mr weasley emerged from a door at the far end of the hall she wa beaming in welcome a she hurried toward them though harry noticed that she wa rather thinner and paler than she had been last time he had seen her oh harry it lovely to see you she whispered pulling him into a ribcracking hug before holding him at arm length and examining him critically you are looking peaky you need feeding up but you will have to wait a bit for dinner i am afraid she turned to the gang of wizard behind him and whispered urgently he just arrived the meeting started page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the wizard behind harry all made noise of interest and excitement and began filing past harry toward the door through which mr weasley had just come harry made to follow lupin but mr weasley held him back no harry the meeting only for member of the order ron and hermione are upstairs you can wait with them until the meeting over and then well have dinner and keep your voice down in the hall she added in an urgent whisper why i do not want to wake anything up what dyou ill explain later i have got to hurry i am supposed to be at the meeting ill just show you where you are sleeping pressing her finger to her lip she led him on tiptoe past a pair of long motheaten curtain behind which harry supposed there must be another door and after skirting a large umbrella stand that looked a though it had been made from a severed troll leg they started up the dark staircase passing a row of shrunken head mounted on plaque on the wall a closer look showed harry that the head belonged to houseelves all of them had the same rather snoutlike nose harrys bewilderment deepened with every step he took what on earth were they doing in a house that looked a though it belonged to the darkest of wizard mr weasley why page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ron and hermione will explain everything dear i have really got to dash mr weasley whispered distractedly there they had reached the second landing you are the door on the right ill call you when it over and she hurried off downstairs again harry crossed the dingy landing turned the bedroom doorknob which wa shaped like a serpent head and opened the door he caught a brief glimpse of a gloomy highceilinged twinbedded room then there wa a loud twittering noise followed by an even louder shriek and his vision wa completely obscured by a large quantity of very bushy hair hermione had thrown herself onto him in a hug that nearly knocked him flat while ron tiny owl pigwidgeon zoomed excitedly round and round their head harry ron he here harrys here we did not hear you arrive oh how are you are you all right have you been furious with u i bet you have i know our letter were useless but we could not tell you anything dumbledore made u swear we would not oh we have got so much to tell you and you have got to tell u the dementors when we heard and that ministry hearing it just outrageous i have looked it all up they can not expel you they just can not there is provision in the decree for the restriction of underage sorcery for the use of magic in life threatening situation let him breathe hermione said ron grinning closing the door behind harry he seemed to have grown several more inch during their month apart making him taller and more gangly looking than ever page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling though the long nose bright red hair and freckle were the same hermione still beaming let go of harry but before she could say another word there wa a soft whooshing sound and something white soared from the top of a dark wardrobe and landed gently on harrys shoulder hedwig the snowy owl clicked her beak and nibbled his ear affectionately a harry stroked her feather she is been in a right state said ron pecked u half to death when she brought your last letter look at this he showed harry the index finger of his right hand which sported a halfhealed but clearly deep cut oh yeah harry said sorry about that but i wanted answer you know we wanted to give them to you mate said ron hermione wa going spare she kept saying you would do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news but dumbledore made u swear not to tell me said harry yeah hermiones already said the warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friend wa extinguished a something icy flooded the pit of his stomach all of a sudden after yearning to see them for a solid month he felt he would rather ron and hermione left him alone page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there wa a strained silence in which harry stroked hedwig automatically not looking at either of the others he seemed to think it wa best said hermione rather breathlessly dumbledore i mean right said harry he noticed that her hand too bore the mark of hedwigs beak and found that he wa not at all sorry i think he thought you were safest with the muggles ron began yeah said harry raising his eyebrow have either of you been attacked by dementors this summer well no but that is why he had people from the order of the phoenix tailing you all the time harry felt a great jolt in his gut a though he had just missed a step going downstairs so everyone had known he wa being followed except him did not work that well though did it said harry doing his utmost to keep his voice even had to look after myself after all did not i he wa so angry said hermione in an almost awestruck voice dumbledore we saw him when he found out mundungus had left before his shift had ended he wa scary well i am glad he left harry said coldly if he had not i would not have done magic and dumbledore would probably have left me at privet drive all summer page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling are not you are not you worried about the ministry of magic hearing said hermione quietly no harry lied defiantly he walked away from them looking around with hedwig nestled contentedly on his shoulder but this room wa not likely to raise his spirit it wa dank and dark a blank stretch of canvas in an ornate picture frame wa all that relieved the bareness of the peeling wall and a harry passed it he thought he heard someone lurking out of sight snigger so why is dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark harry asked still trying hard to keep his voice casual did you er bother to ask him at all he glanced up just in time to see them exchanging a look that told him he wa behaving just a they had feared he would it did nothing to improve his temper we told dumbledore we wanted to tell you what wa going on said ron we did mate but he really busy now we have only seen him twice since we came here and he did not have much time he just made u swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote he said the owl might be intercepted he could stillve kept me informed if he would wanted to harry said shortly you are not telling me he doe not know way to send message without owl hermione glanced at ron and then said i thought that too but he did not want you to know anything maybe he think i can not be trusted said harry watching their expression do not be thick said ron looking highly disconcerted page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling or that i can not take care of myself of course he doe not think that said hermione anxiously so how come i have to stay at the dursleys while you two get to join in everything that is going on here said harry the word tumbling over one another in a rush his voice growing louder with every word how come you two are allowed to know everything that is going on were not ron interrupted mum will not let u near the meeting she say were too young but before he knew it harry wa shouting so you have not been in the meeting big deal you have still been here haven t you you have still been together me i have been stuck at the dursleys for a month and i have handled more than you twove ever managed and dumbledore know it who saved the sorcerer stone who got rid of riddle who saved both your skin from the dementors every bitter and resentful thought that harry had had in the past month wa pouring out of him his frustration at the lack of news the hurt that they had all been together without him his fury at being followed and not told about it all the feeling he wa halfashamed of finally burst their boundary hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off on top of the wardrobe again pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their head who had to get past dragon and sphinx and every other foul thing last year who page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling saw him come back who had to escape from him me ron wa standing there with his mouth halfopen clearly stunned and at a loss for anything to say while hermione looked on the verge of tear but why should i know what is going on why should anyone bother to tell me what is been happening harry we wanted to tell you we really did hermione began can not have wanted to that much can you or you would have sent me an owl but dumbledore made you swear well he did four week i have been stuck in privet drive nicking paper out of bin to try and find out what is been going on we wanted to i suppose you have been having a real laugh have not you all holed up here together no honest harry were really sorry said hermione desperately her eye now sparkling with tear you are absolutely right harry id be furious if it wa me harry glared at her still breathing deeply then turned away from them again pacing up and down hedwig hooted glumly from the top of the wardrobe page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there wa a long pause broken only by the mournful creak of the floorboard below harrys foot what is this place anyway he shot at ron and hermione headquarters of the order of the phoenix said ron at once is anyone going to bother telling me what the order of the phoenix it a secret society said hermione quickly dumbledores in charge he founded it it the people who fought against youknowwho last time who is in it said harry coming to a halt with his hand in his pocket quite a few people we have met about twenty of them said ron but we think there are more harry glared at them well he demanded looking from one to the other er said ron well what voldemorti said harry furiously and both ron and hermione winced what is happening what is he up to where is he what are we doing to stop him we have told you the order do not let u in on their meeting said hermione nervously so we do not know the detail but we have got a general idea she added hastily seeing the look on harrys face page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fred and george have invented extendable ear see said ron they are really useful extendable ear yeah only we have had to stop using them lately because mum found out and went berserk fred and george had to hide them all to stop mum binning them but we got a good bit of use out of them before mum realized what wa going on we know some of the order are following known death eater keeping tab on them you know some of them are working on recruiting more people to the order said hermione and some of them are standing guard over something said ron they are always talking about guard duty could not have been me could it said harry sarcastically oh yeah said ron with a look of dawning comprehension harry snorted he walked around the room again looking anywhere but at ron and hermione so what have you two been doing if you are not allowed in meeting he demanded you said you would been busy we have said hermione quickly we have been decontaminating this house it been empty for age and stuff been breeding in here we have managed to clean out the kitchen most of the bedroom and i think were doing the drawing room tomo aargh with two loud crack fred and george ron elder twin brother had materialized out of thin air in the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling middle of the room pigwidgeon twittered more wildly than ever and zoomed off to join hedwig on top of the wardrobe stop doing that hermione said weakly to the twin who were a vividly redhaired a ron though stockier and slightly shorter hello harry said george beaming at him we thought we heard your dulcet tone you do not want to bottle up your anger like that harry let it all out said fred also beaming there might be a couple of people fifty mile away who did not hear you you two passed your apparation test then asked harry grumpily with distinction said fred who wa holding what looked like a piece of very long fleshcolored string it would have taken you about thirty second longer to walk down the stair said ron time is galleon little brother said fred anyway harry you are interfering with reception extendable ear he added in response to harrys raised eyebrow holding up the string which harry now saw wa trailing out onto the landing were trying to hear what is going on downstairs you want to be careful said ron staring at the ear if mum see one of them again it worth the risk that is a major meeting they are having said fred page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the door opened and a long mane of red hair appeared oh hello harry said ron younger sister ginny brightly i thought i heard your voice turning to fred and george she said it no go with the extendable ear she is gone and put an imperturbable charm on the kitchen door how dyou know said george looking crestfallen tonks told me how to find out said ginny you just chuck stuff at the door and if it can not make contact the door been imperturbed i have been flicking dungbombs at it from the top of the stair and they just soar away from it so there is no way the extendable ear will be able to get under the gap fred heaved a deep sigh shame i really fancied finding out what old snapes been up to snape said harry quickly is he here yeah said george carefully closing the door and sitting down on one of the bed fred and ginny followed giving a report top secret git said fred idly he on our side now said hermione reprovingly ron snorted doe not stop him being a git the way he look at u when he see u bill doe not like him either said ginny a though that settled the matter page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry wa not sure his anger had abated yet but his thirst for information wa now overcoming his urge to keep shouting he sank onto the bed opposite the others is bill here he asked i thought he wa working in egypt he applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the order said fred he say he miss the tomb but he smirked there are compensation what dyou mean remember old fleur delacour said george she is got a job at gringotts to eemprove er eeenglish and bill been giving her a lot of private lesson sniggered fred charlies in the order too said george but he still in romania dumbledore want a many foreign wizard brought in a possible so charlies trying to make contact on his day off could not percy do that harry asked the last he had heard the third weasley brother wa working in the department of international magical cooperation at the ministry of magic at these word all the weasleys and hermione exchanged darkly significant look whatever you do do not mention percy in front of mum and dad ron told harry in a tense voice why not page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling because every time percy name mentioned dad break whatever he holding and mum start cry fred said it been awful said ginny sadly i think were well shut of him said george with an uncharacteristically ugly look on his face what is happened harry said percy and dad had a row said fred i have never seen dad row with anyone like that it normally mum who shout it wa the first week back after term ended said ron we were about to come and join the order percy came home and told u he would been promoted you are kidding said harry though he knew perfectly well that percy wa highly ambitious harrys impression wa that percy had not made a great success of his first job at the ministry of magic percy had committed the fairly large oversight of failing to notice that his bos wa being controlled by lord voldemort not that the ministry had believed that they all thought that mr crouch had gone mad yeah we were all surprised said george because percy got into a load of trouble about crouch there wa an inquiry and everything they said percy ought to have realized crouch wa off his rocker and informed a superior but you know percy crouch left him in charge he wa not going to complain so how come they promoted him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling that is exactly what we wondered said ron who seemed very keen to keep normal conversation going now that harry had stopped yelling he came home really pleased with himself even more pleased than usual if you can imagine that and told dad he would been offered a position in fudge own office a really good one for someone only a year out of hogwarts junior assistant to the minister he expected dad to be all impressed i think only dad wa not said fred grimly why not said harry well apparently fudge ha been storming round the ministry checking that nobody having any contact with dumbledore said george dumbledores name mud with the ministry these day see said fred they all think he just making trouble saying youknow who is back dad say fudge ha made it clear that anyone who is in league with dumbledore can clear out their desk said george trouble is fudge suspect dad he know he friendly with dumbledore and he always thought dad a bit of a weirdo because of his muggle obsession but what is this got to do with percy asked harry confused i am coming to that dad reckons fudge only want percy in his office because he want to use him to spy on the family and dumbledore harry let out a low whistle page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling bet percy loved that ron laughed in a hollow sort of way he went completely berserk he said well he said load of terrible stuff he said he been having to struggle against dad lousy reputation ever since he joined the ministry and that dad got no ambition and that is why we have always been you know not had a lot of money i mean what said harry in disbelief a ginny made a noise like an angry cat i know said ron in a low voice and it got worse he said dad wa an idiot to run around with dumbledore that dumbledore wa heading for big trouble and dad wa going to go down with him and that he percy knew where his loyalty lay and it wa with the ministry and if mum and dad were going to become traitor to the ministry he wa going to make sure everyone knew he did not belong to our family anymore and he packed his bag the same night and left he living here in london now harry swore under his breath he had always liked percy least of ron brother but he had never imagined he would say such thing to mr weasley mum been in a right state said ron you know cry and stuff she came up to london to try and talk to percy but he slammed the door in her face i do not know what he doe if he meet dad at work ignores him i spose but percy must know voldemorts back said harry slowly he not stupid he must know your mum and dad would not risk everything without proof page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah well your name got dragged into the row said ron shooting harry a furtive look percy said the only evidence wa your word and i do not know he did not think it wa good enough percy take the daily prophet seriously said hermione tartly and the others all nodded what are you talking about harry asked looking around at them all they were all regarding him warily have not have not you been getting the daily prophet hermione asked nervously yeah i have said harry have you er been reading it thoroughly hermione asked still more anxiously not cover to cover said harry defensively if they were going to report anything about voldemort it would be headline news would not it the others flinched at the sound of the name hermione hurried on well you would need to read it cover to cover to pick it up but they um they mention you a couple of time a week but id have seen not if you have only been reading the front page you would not said hermione shaking her head i am not talking about big article they just slip you in like you are a standing joke what dyou page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it quite nasty actually said hermione in a voice of forced calm they are just building on ritas stuff but she is not writing for them anymore is she oh no she is kept her promise not that she is got any choice hermione added with satisfaction but she laid the foundation for what they are trying to do now which is what said harry impatiently okay you know she wrote that you were collapsing all over the place and saying your scar wa hurting and all that yeah said harry who wa not likely to forget rita skeeters story about him in a hurry well they are writing about you a though you are this deluded attentionseeking person who think he a great tragic hero or something said hermione very fast a though it would be le unpleasant for harry to hear these fact quickly they keep slipping in snide comment about you if some farfetched story appears they say something like a tale worthy of harry potter and if anyone ha a funny accident or anything it let u hope he ha not got a scar on his forehead or well be asked to worship him next i do not want anyone to worship harry began hotly i know you do not said hermione quickly looking frightened i know harry but you see what they are doing they want to turn you into someone nobody will believe fudge is behind it ill bet anything they want wizard on the street to think you are just some stupid boy who is a bit of a joke who tell ridiculous page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tall story because he love being famous and want to keep it going i did not ask i did not want voldemort killed my parentsv harry spluttered i got famous because he murdered my family but could not kill me who want to be famous for that do not they think id rather it would never we know harry said ginny earnestly and of course they did not report a word about the dementors attacking you said hermione someone is told them to keep that quiet that should have been a really big story outofcontrol dementors they have not even reported that you broke the international statute of secrecy we thought they would it would tie in so well with this image of you a some stupid showoff we think they are biding their time until you are expelled then they are really going to go to town i mean if you are expelled obviously she went on hastily you really should not be not if they abide by their own law there is no case against you they were back on the hearing and harry did not want to think about it he cast around for another change of subject but wa saved the necessity of finding one by the sound of footstep coming up the stair uhoh fred gave the extendable ear a hearty tug there wa another loud crack and he and george vanished second later mr weasley appeared in the bedroom doorway the meeting over you can come down and have dinner now everyone is dying to see you harry and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling who is left all those dungbombs outside the kitchen door crookshanks said ginny unblushingly he love playing with them oh said mr weasley i thought it might have been kreacher he keep doing odd thing like that now do not forget to keep your voice down in the hall ginny your hand are filthy what have you been doing go and wash them before dinner please ginny grimaced at the others and followed her mother out of the room leaving harry alone with ron and hermione again both of them were watching him apprehensively a though they feared that he would start shouting again now that everyone else had gone the sight of them looking so nervous made him feel slightly ashamed look he muttered but ron shook his head and hermione said quietly we knew you would be angry harry we really do not blame you but you have got to understand we did try and persuade dumbledore yeah i know said harry grudgingly he cast around for a topic to change the subject from dumbledore the very thought of him made harrys inside burn with anger again who is kreacher he asked the houseelf who life here said ron nutter never met one like him hermione frowned at ron he not a nutter ron page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling his life ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother said ron irritably is that normal hermione well well if he is a bit strange it not his fault ron rolled his eye at harry hermione still ha not given up on spew it not spew said hermione heatedly it the society for the promotion of elfish welfare and it not just me dumbledore say we should be kind to kreacher too yeah yeah said ron cmon i am starving he led the way out of the door and onto the landing but before they could descend the stair hold it ron breathed flinging out an arm to stop harry and hermione walking any farther they are still in the hall we might be able to hear something the three of them looked cautiously over the banister the gloomy hallway below wa packed with witch and wizard including all of harrys guard they were whispering excitedly together in the very center of the group harry saw the dark greasyhaired head and prominent nose of his least favorite teacher at hogwarts professor snape harry leaned farther over the banister he wa very interested in what snape wa doing for the order of the phoenix a thin piece of fleshcolored string descended in front of harrys eye looking up he saw fred and george on the landing above cautiously lowering the extendable ear toward the dark knot of people below a moment later however they began to move toward the front door and out of sight page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dammit harry heard fred whisper a he hoisted the extendable ear back up again they heard the front door open and then close snape never eats here ron told harry quietly thank god cmon and do not forget to keep your voice down in the hall harry hermione whispered a they passed the row of houseelf head on the wall they saw lupin mr weasley and tonks at the front door magically sealing it many lock and bolt behind those who had just left were eating down in the kitchen mr weasley whispered meeting them at the bottom of the stair harry dear if you will just tiptoe across the hall it through this door here crash tonksl cried mr weasley exasperatedly turning to look behind her i am sorry wailed tonks who wa lying flat on the floor it that stupid umbrella stand that is the second time i have tripped over but the rest of her word were drowned by a horrible earsplitting bloodcurdling screech the motheaten velvet curtain harry had passed earlier had flown apart but there wa no door behind them for a split second harry thought he wa looking through a window a window behind which an old woman in a black cap wa screaming and screaming a though she wa being tortured then page looharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he realized it wa simply a lifesize portrait but the most realistic and the most unpleasant he had ever seen in his life the old woman wa drooling her eye were rolling the yellowing skin of her face stretched taut a she screamed and all along the hall behind them the other portrait awoke and began to yell too so that harry actually screwed up his eye at the noise and clapped his hand over his ear lupin and mr weasley darted forward and tried to tug the curtain shut over the old woman but they would not close and she screeched louder than ever brandishing clawed hand a though trying to tear at their face filth scum byproduct of dirt and vileness half breed mutant freak begone from this place how dare you befoul the house of my father tonks apologized over and over again at the same time dragging the huge heavy troll leg back off the floor mr weasley abandoned the attempt to close the curtain and hurried up and down the hall stunning all the other portrait with her wand then a man with long black hair came charging out of a door facing harry shut up you horrible old hag shut up he roared seizing the curtain mr weasley had abandoned the old woman face blanched yooooul she howled her eye popping at the sight of the man blood traitor abomination shame of my fleshl page lolharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i said shut up roared the man and with a stupendous effort he and lupin managed to force the curtain closed again the old woman screech died and an echoing silence fell panting slightly and sweeping his long dark hair out of his eye harrys godfather sirius turned to face him hello harry he said grimly i see you have met my mother page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the order of the phoenix your my dear old mum yeah said sirius we have been trying to get her down for a month but we think she put a permanent sticking charm on the back of the canvas let u get downstairs quick before they all wake up again but what is a portrait of your mother doing here harry asked bewildered a they went through the door from the hall and led the way down a flight of narrow stone step the others just behind them ha not anyone told you this wa my parent house said sirius but i am the last black left so it mine now i offered it to dumbledore for headquarters about the only useful thing i have been able to do harry who had expected a better welcome noted how hard and bitter sirius voice sounded he followed his godfather to the bottom of the stair and through a door leading into the basement kitchen page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa scarcely le gloomy than the hall above a cavernous room with rough stone wall most of the light wa coming from a large fire at the far end of the room a haze of pipe smoke hung in the air like battle fume through which loomed the menacing shape of heavy iron pot and pan hanging from the dark ceiling many chair had been crammed into the room for the meeting and a long wooden table stood in the middle of the room littered with roll of parchment goblet empty wine bottle and a heap of what appeared to be rag mr weasley and his eldest son bill were talking quietly with their head together at the end of the table mr weasley cleared her throat her husband a thin balding redhaired man who wore hornrimmed glass looked around and jumped to his foot harry mr weasley said hurrying forward to greet him and shaking his hand vigorously good to see you over his shoulder harry saw bill who still wore his long hair in a ponytail hastily rolling up the length of parchment left on the table journey all right harry bill called trying to gather up twelve scroll at once madeye did not make you come via greenland then he tried said tonks striding over to help bill and immediately sending a candle toppling onto the last piece of parchment oh no sorry here dear said mr weasley sounding exasperated and she repaired the parchment with a wave of her wand in the flash of light caused by mr weasleys charm harry caught a glimpse of what looked like the plan of a building page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling mr weasley had seen him looking she snatched the plan off the table and stuffed it into bill heavily laden arm this sort of thing ought to be cleared away promptly at the end of meeting she snapped before sweeping off toward an ancient dresser from which she started unloading dinner plate bill took out his wand muttered evanescol and the scroll vanished sit down harry said sirius you have met mundungus have not you the thing harry had taken to be a pile of rag gave a prolonged grunting snore and then jerked awake soman say m name mundungus mumbled sleepily i gree with sirius he raised a very grubby hand in the air a though voting his droopy bloodshot eye unfocused ginny giggled the meeting over dung said sirius a they all sat down around him at the table harrys arrived eh said mundungus peering balefully at harry through his matted ginger hair blimey so e a yeah you all right arry yeah said harry mundungus fumbled nervously in his pocket still staring at harry and pulled out a grimy black pipe he stuck it in his mouth ignited the end of it with his wand and took a deep pull on it great billowing cloud of greenish smoke obscured him in second page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling owe you a pology grunted a voice from the middle of the smelly cloud for the last time mundungus called mr weasley will you please not smoke that thing in the kitchen especially not when were about to eat ah said mundungus right sorry molly the cloud of smoke vanished a mundungus stowed his pipe back in his pocket but an acrid smell of burning sock lingered and if you want dinner before midnight ill need a hand mr weasley said to the room at large no you can stay where you are harry dear you have had a long journey what can i do molly said tonks enthusiastically bounding forward mr weasley hesitated looking apprehensive er no it all right tonks you have a rest too you have done enough today no no i want to help said tonks brightly knocking over a chair a she hurried toward the dresser from which ginny wa collecting cutlery soon a series of heavy knife were chopping meat and vegetable of their own accord supervised by mr weasley while mr weasley stirred a cauldron dangling over the fire and the others took out plate more goblet and food from the pantry harry wa left at the table with sirius and mundungus who wa still blinking mournfully at him seen old figgy since he asked page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no said harry i have not seen anyone see i would not ave left said mundungus leaning forward a pleading note in his voice but i ad a business opportunity harry felt something brush against his knee and started but it wa only crookshanks hermiones bandylegged ginger cat who wound himself once around harrys leg purring then jumped onto sirius lap and curled up sirius scratched him absentmindedly behind the ear a he turned still grimfaced to harry had a good summer so far no it been lousy said harry for the first time something like a grin flitted across sirius face do not know what you are complaining about myself what said harry incredulously personally id have welcomed a dementor attack a deadly struggle for my soul would have broken the monotony nicely you think you have had it bad at least you have been able to get out and about stretch your leg get into a few fight i have been stuck inside for a month how come asked harry frowning because the ministry of magic still after me and voldemort will know all about me being an animagus by now wormtail will have told him so my big disguise is useless there is not much i can do for the order of the phoenix or so dumbledore feel page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there wa something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which sirius uttered dumbledores name that told harry that sirius wa not very happy with the headmaster either harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather at least you have known what is been going on he said bracingly oh yeah said sirius sarcastically listening to snapes report having to take all his snide hint that he out there risking his life while i am sat on my backside here having a nice comfortable time asking me how the cleaning going what cleaning asked harry trying to make this place fit for human habitation said sirius waving a hand around the dismal kitchen no one lived here for ten year not since my dear mother died unless you count her old houseelf and he gone round the twist ha not cleaned anything in age sirius said mundungus who did not appear to have paid any attention to this conversation but had been minutely examining an empty goblet this solid silver mate yes said sirius surveying it with distaste finest fifteenthcentury goblinwrought silver embossed with the black family crest that would come off though muttered mundungus polishing it with his cuff fred george no just carry them mr weasley shrieked page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry sirius and mundungus looked around and a split second later dived away from the table fred and george had bewitched a large cauldron of stew an iron flagon of butterbeer and a heavy wooden breadboard complete with knife to hurtle through the air toward them the stew skidded the length of the table and came to a halt just before the end leaving a long black burn on the wooden surface the flagon of butterbeer fell with a crash spilling it content everywhere and the bread knife slipped off the board and landed point down and quivering ominously exactly where sirius right hand had been second before for heaven sake screamed mr weasley there wa no need i have had enough of this just because you are allowed to use magic now you do not have to whip your wand out for every tiny little thing we were just trying to save a bit of time said fred hurrying forward and wrenching the bread knife out of the table sorry sirius mate did not mean to harry and sirius were both laughing mundungus who had toppled backward off his chair wa swearing a he got to his foot crookshanks had given an angry hiss and shot off under the dresser from whence his large yellow eye glowed in the darkness boy mr weasley said lifting the stew back into the middle of the table your mother right you are supposed to show a sense of responsibility now you have come of age none of your brother caused this sort of trouble mr weasley raged at the twin slamming a fresh flagon of butterbeer onto the table and spilling almost a much again bill did not feel the need to apparate page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling every few foot charlie did not charm everything he met percy she stopped dead catching her breath with a frightened look at her husband whose expression wa suddenly wooden let u eat said bill quickly it look wonderful molly said lupin ladling stew onto a plate for her and handing it across the table for a few minute there wa silence but for the chink of plate and cutlery and the scraping of chair a everyone settled down to their food then mr weasley turned to sirius and said i have been meaning to tell you there is something trapped in that writing desk in the drawing room it keep rattling and shaking of course it could just be a boggart but i thought we ought to ask alastor to have a look at it before we let it out whatever you like said sirius indifferently the curtain in there are full of doxy too mr weasley went on i thought we might try and tackle them tomorrow i look forward to it said sirius harry heard the sarcasm in his voice but he wa not sure that anyone else did opposite harry tonks wa entertaining hermione and ginny by transforming her nose between mouthful screwing up her eye each time with the same pained expression she had worn back in harrys bedroom her nose swelled to a beaklike protuberance like snapes shrank to something resembling a button mushroom and then sprouted a great deal of page lloharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hair from each nostril apparently this wa a regular mealtime entertainment because after a while hermione and ginny started requesting their favorite nose do that one like a pig snout tonks tonks obliged and harry looking up had the fleeting impression that a female dudley wa grinning at him from across the table mr weasley bill and lupin were having an intense discussion about goblin they are not giving anything away yet said bill i still can not work out whether they believe he back or not course they might prefer not to take side at all keep out of it i am sure they would never go over to youknowwho said mr weasley shaking his head they have suffered loss too remember that goblin family he murdered last time somewhere near nottingham i think it depends what they are offered said lupin and i am not talking about gold if they are offered freedom we have been denying them for century they are going to be tempted have you still not had any luck with ragnok bill he feeling pretty antiwizard at the moment said bill he ha not stopped raging about the bagman business he reckons the ministry did a coverup those goblin never got their gold from him you know a gale of laughter from the middle of the table drowned the rest of bill word fred george ron and mundungus were rolling around in their seat page lllharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and then choked mundungus tear running down his face and then if you will believe it e say to me e say ere dung where didja get all them toad from co some son of a bludgers gone and nicked all mine and i say nicked all your toad will what next so you will be wanting some more then and if you will believe me lad the gormless gargoyle buy all is own toad back orf me for twice what e paid in the first place i do not think we need to hear any more of your business dealing thank you very much mundungus said mr weasley sharply a ron slumped forward onto the table howling with laughter beg pardon molly said mundungus at once wiping his eye and winking at harry but you know will nicked them orf warty harris in the first place so i wa not really doing nothing wrong i do not know where you learned about right and wrong mundungus but you seem to have missed a few crucial lesson said mr weasley coldly fred and george buried their face in their goblet of butterbeer george wa hiccuping for some reason mr weasley threw a very nasty look at sirius before getting to her foot and going to fetch a large rhubarb crumble for pudding harry looked round at his godfather molly doe not approve of mundungus said sirius in an undertone how come he in the order harry said very quietly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he useful sirius muttered know all the crook well he would seeing a he one himself but he also very loyal to dumbledore who helped him out of a tight spot once it pay to have someone like dung around he hears thing we do not but molly think inviting him to stay for dinner is going too far she ha not forgiven him for slipping off duty when he wa supposed to be tailing you three helping of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on harrys jean wa feeling uncomfortably tight which wa saying something a the jean had once been dudleys he lay down his spoon in a lull in the general conversation mr weasley wa leaning back in his chair looking replete and relaxed tonks wa yawning widely her nose now back to normal and ginny who had lured crookshanks out from under the dresser wa sitting crosslegged on the floor rolling butterbeer cork for him to chase nearly time for bed i think said mr weasley on a yawn not just yet molly said sirius pushing away his empty plate and turning to look at harry you know i am surprised at you i thought the first thing you would do when you got here would be to start asking question about voldemort the atmosphere in the room changed with the rapidity harry associated with the arrival of dementors where second before it had been sleepily relaxed it wa now alert even tense a frisson had gone around the table at the mention of voldemorts name lupin who had been about to take a sip of wine lowered his goblet slowly looking wary page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i did said harry indignantly i asked ron and hermione but they said were not allowed in the order so and they are quite right said mr weasley you are too young she wa sitting bolt upright in her chair her fist clenched upon it arm every trace of drowsiness gone since when did someone have to be in the order of the phoenix to ask question asked sirius harrys been trapped in that muggle house for a month he got the right to know what is been happen hang on interrupted george loudly how come harry get his question answered said fred angrily we have been trying to get stuff out of you for a month and you have not told u a single stinking thing said george you are too young you are not in the order said fred in a highpitched voice that sounded uncannily like his mother harrys not even of age it not my fault you have not been told what the order doing said sirius calmly that is your parent decision harry on the other hand it not down to you to decide what is good for harry said mr weasley sharply her normally kindly face looked dangerous you have not forgotten what dumbledore said i suppose page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling which bit sirius asked politely but with an air a though readying himself for a fight the bit about not telling harry more than he need to know said mr weasley placing a heavy emphasis on the last three word ron hermione fred and george head turned from sirius to mr weasley a though following a tennis rally ginny wa kneeling amid a pile of abandoned butterbeer cork watching the conversation with her mouth slightly open lupin eye were fixed on sirius i do not intend to tell him more than he need to know molly said sirius but a he wa the one who saw voldemort come back again there wa a collective shudder around the table at the name he ha more right than most to he not a member of the order of the phoenix said mr weasley he only fifteen and and he dealt with a much a most in the order said sirius and more than some no one denying what he done said mr weasley her voice rising her fist trembling on the arm of her chair but he still he not a child said sirius impatiently he not an adult either said mr weasley the color rising in her cheek he not james sirius i am perfectly clear who he is thanks molly said sirius coldly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tm not sure you are said mr weasley sometimes the way you talk about him it a though you think you have got your best friend back what is wrong with that said harry what is wrong harry is that you are not your father however much you might look like him said mr weasley her eye still boring into sirius you are still at school and adult responsible for you should not forget it meaning i am an irresponsible godfather demanded sirius his voice rising meaning you have been known to act rashly sirius which is why dumbledore keep reminding you to stay at home and well leave my instruction from dumbledore out of this if you please said sirius loudly arthur said mr weasley rounding on her husband arthur back me up mr weasley did not speak at once he took off his glass and cleaned them slowly on his robe not looking at his wife only when he had replaced them carefully on his nose did he say dumbledore know the position ha changed molly he accepts that harry will have to be filled in to a certain extent now that he is staying at headquarters yes but there is a difference between that and inviting him to ask whatever he like personally said lupin quietly looking away from sirius at last a mr weasley turned quickly to him hopeful that finally she wa about to get an ally i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling think it better that harry get the fact not all the fact molly but the general picture from u rather than a garbled version from others his expression wa mild but harry felt sure that lupin at least knew that some extendable ear had survived mr weasleys purge well said mr weasley breathing deeply and looking around the table for support that did not come well i can see i am going to be overruled ill just say this dumbledore must have had his reason for not wanting harry to know too much and speaking a someone who ha got harrys best interest at heart he not your son said sirius quietly he a good a said mr weasley fiercely who else ha he got he got me yes said mr weasley her lip curling the thing is it been rather difficult for you to look after him while you have been locked up in azkaban ha not it sirius started to rise from his chair molly you are not the only person at this table who care about harry said lupin sharply sirius sit down mr weasleys lower lip wa trembling sirius sank slowly back into his chair his face white i think harry ought to be allowed a say in this lupin continued he old enough to decide for himself page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i want to know what is been going on harry said at once he did not look at mr weasley he had been touched by what she had said about his being a good a a son but he wa also impatient at her mollycoddling sirius wa right he wa not a child very well said mr weasley her voice cracking ginny ron hermione fred george i want you out of this kitchen now there wa instant uproar were of age fred and george bellowed together if harrys allowed why can not i shouted ron mum i want to wailed ginny no shouted mr weasley standing up her eye overbright i absolutely forbid molly you can not stop fred and george said mr weasley wearily they are of age they are still at school but they are legally adult now said mr weasley in the same tired voice mr weasley wa now scarlet in the face i oh all right then fred and george can stay but ron harryll tell me and hermione everything you say anyway said ron hotly will not will not you he added uncertainly meeting harrys eye page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling for a split second harry considered telling ron that he would not tell him a single word that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it but the nasty impulse vanished a they looked at each other course i will harry said ron and hermione beamed fine shouted mr weasley fine ginny bed ginny did not go quietly they could hear her raging and storming at her mother all the way up the stair and when she reached the hall mr black earsplitting shriek were added to the din lupin hurried off to the portrait to restore calm it wa only after he had returned closing the kitchen door behind him and taking his seat at the table again that sirius spoke okay harry what do you want to know harry took a deep breath and asked the question that had been obsessing him for a month where is voldemort what is he doing i have been trying to watch the muggle news he said ignoring the renewed shudder and wince at the name and there ha not been anything that look like him yet no funny death or anything that is because there have not been any suspicious death yet said sirius not a far a we know anyway and we know quite a lot more than he think we do anyway said lupin page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling how come he stopped killing people harry asked he knew that voldemort had murdered more than once in the last year alone because he doe not want to draw attention to himself at the moment said sirius it would be dangerous for him his comeback did not come off quite the way he wanted it to you see he messed it up or rather you messed it up for him said lupin with a satisfied smile how harry asked perplexedly you were not supposed to survive said sirius nobody apart from his death eater wa supposed to know he would come back but you survived to bear witness and the very last person he wanted alerted to his return the moment he got back wa dumbledore said lupin and you made sure dumbledore knew at once how ha that helped harry asked are you kidding said bill incredulously dumbledore wa the only one youknowwho wa ever scared of thanks to you dumbledore wa able to recall the order of the phoenix about an hour after voldemort returned said sirius so what is the order been doing said harry looking around at them all working a hard a we can to make sure voldemort can not carry out his plan said sirius page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling how dyou know what his plan are harry asked quickly dumbledores got a shrewd idea said lupin and dumbledores shrewd idea normally turn out to be accurate so what doe dumbledore reckon he planning well firstly he want to build up his army again said sirius in the old day he had huge number at his command witch and wizard he would bullied or bewitched into following him his faithful death eater a great variety of dark creature you heard him planning to recruit the giant well they will be just one group he after he certainly not going to try and take on the ministry of magic with only a dozen death eater so you are trying to stop him getting more follower were doing our best said lupin how well the main thing is to try and convince a many people a possible that youknowwho really ha returned to put them on their guard said bill it proving tricky though why because of the ministry attitude said tonks you saw cornelius fudge after youknowwho came back harry well he ha not shifted his position at all he absolutely refusing to believe it happened but why said harry desperately why is he being so stupid if dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ah well you have put your finger on the problem said mr weasley with a wry smile dumbledore fudge is frightened of him you see said tonks sadly frightened of dumbledore said harry incredulously frightened of what he up to said mr weasley you see fudge think dumbledores plotting to overthrow him he think dumbledore want to be minister of magic but dumbledore doe not want of course he doe not said mr weasley he never wanted the minister job even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when millicent bagnold retired fudge came to power instead but he never quite forgotten how much popular support dumbledore had even though dumbledore never applied for the job deep down fudge know dumbledores much cleverer than he is a much more powerful wizard and in the early day of his ministry he wa forever asking dumbledore for help and advice said lupin but it seems that he become fond of power now and much more confident he love being minister of magic and he managed to convince himself that he the clever one and dumbledores simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it how can he think that said harry angrily how can he think dumbledore would just make it all up that id make it all up page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling because accepting that voldemorts back would mean trouble like the ministry ha not had to cope with for nearly fourteen year said sirius bitterly fudge just can not bring himself to face it it so much more comfortable to convince himself dumbledores lying to destabilize him you see the problem said lupin while the ministry insists there is nothing to fear from voldemort it hard to convince people he back especially a they really do not want to believe it in the first place what is more the ministry leaning heavily on the daily prophet not to report any of what they are calling dumbledores rumormongering so most of the wizarding community are completely unaware anythings happened and that make them easy target for the death eater if they are using the imperius curse but you are telling people are not you said harry looking around at mr weasley sirius bill mundungus lupin and tonks you are letting people know he back they all smiled humorlessly well a everyone think i am a mad mass murderer and the ministry put a tenthousandgalleon price on my head i can hardly stroll up the street and start handing out leaflet can i said sirius restlessly and i am not a very popular dinner guest with most of the community said lupin it an occupational hazard of being a werewolf tonks and arthur would lose their job at the ministry if they started shooting their mouth off said sirius and it very important for u to have page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling spy inside the ministry because you can bet voldemort will have them we have managed to convince a couple of people though said mr weasley tonks here for one she is too young to have been in the order of the phoenix last time and having aurors on our side is a huge advantage kingsley shacklebolts been a real asset too he in charge of the hunt for sirius so he been feeding the ministry information that sirius is in tibet but if none of yous putting the news out that voldemort s back harry began who said none of u wa putting the news out said sirius why dyou think dumbledores in such trouble what dyou mean harry asked they are trying to discredit him said lupin did not you see the daily prophet last week they reported that he would been voted out of the chairmanship of the international confederation of wizard because he getting old and losing his grip but it not true he wa voted out by ministry wizard after he made a speech announcing voldemorts return they have demoted him from chief warlock on the wizengamot that is the wizard high court and they are talking about taking away his order of merlin first class too but dumbledore say he doe not care what they do a long a they do not take him off the chocolate frog card said bill grinning it no laughing matter said mr weasley shortly if he carry on defying the ministry like this he could page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling end up in azkaban and the last thing we want is dumbledore locked up while youknowwho know dumbledores out there and wise to what he up to he going to go cautiously for a while if dumbledores out of the way well youknowwho will have a clear field but if voldemorts trying to recruit more death eater it bound to get out that he come back is not it asked harry desperately voldemort doe not march up to people house and bang on their front door harry said sirius he trick jinx and blackmail them he well practiced at operating in secrecy in any case gathering follower is only one thing he interested in he got other plan too plan he can put into operation very quietly indeed and he concentrating on them at the moment what is he after apart from follower harry asked swiftly he thought he saw sirius and lupin exchange the most fleeting of look before sirius said stuff he can only get by stealth when harry continued to look puzzled sirius said like a weapon something he did not have last time when he wa powerful before yes like what kind of weapon said harry something worse than the avada kedavra that is enough page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling mr weasley spoke from the shadow beside the door harry had not noticed her return from taking ginny upstairs her arm were crossed and she looked furious i want you in bed now all of you she added looking around at fred george ron and hermione you can not bos u fred began watch me snarled mr weasley she wa trembling slightly a she looked at sirius you have given harry plenty of information any more and you might just a well induct him into the order straightaway why not said harry quickly ill join i want to join i want to fight no it wa not mr weasley who spoke this time but lupin the order is comprised only of overage wizard he said wizard who have left school he added a fred and george opened their mouth there are danger involved of which you can have no idea any of you i think molly right sirius we have said enough sirius halfshrugged but did not argue mr weasley beckoned imperiously to her son and hermione one by one they stood up and harry recognizing defeat followed suit page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the noble and most ancient house of black mr weasley followed them upstairs looking grim i want you all to go straight to bed no talking she said a they reached the first landing we have got a busy day tomorrow i expect ginnys asleep she added to hermione so try not to wake her up asleep yeah right said fred in an undertone after hermione bade them good night and they were climbing to the next floor if ginnys not lying awake waiting for hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then i am a flobberworm all right ron harry said mr weasley on the second landing pointing them into their bedroom off to bed with you night harry and ron said to the twin sleep tight said fred winking page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling mr weasley closed the door behind harry with a sharp snap the bedroom looked if anything even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight the blank picture on the wall wa now breathing very slowly and deeply a though it invisible occupant wa asleep harry put on his pajama took off his glass and climbed into his chilly bed while ron threw owl treat up on top of the wardrobe to pacify hedwig and pigwidgeon who were clattering around and rustling their wing restlessly we can not let them out to hunt every night ron explained a he pulled on his maroon pajama dumbledore doe not want too many owl swooping around the square think it will look suspicious oh yeah i forgot he crossed to the door and bolted it what re you doing that for kreacher said ron a he turned off the light first night i wa here he came wandering in at three in the morning trust me you do not want to wake up and find him prowling around your room anyway he got into his bed settled down under the cover then turned to look at harry in the darkness harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window what dyou reckon harry did not need to ask what ron meant well they did not tell u much we could not have guessed did they he said thinking of all that had been said downstairs i mean all they have really said is that the order trying to stop people joining vol there wa a sharp intake of breath from ron page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling demort said harry firmly when are you going to start using his name sirius and lupin do ron ignored this last comment yeah you are right he said we already knew nearly everything they told u from using the extendable ear the only new bit wa crack ouch keep your voice down ron or mumll be back up here you two just apparated on my knee yeah well it harder in the dark harry saw the blurred outline of fred and george leaping down from ron bed there wa a groan of bedspring and harrys mattress descended a few inch a george sat down near his foot so got there yet said george eagerly the weapon sirius mentioned said harry let slip more like said fred with relish now sitting next to ron we did not hear about that on the old extendables did we what dyou reckon it is said harry could be anything said fred but there can not be anything worse than the avada kedavra curse can there said ron what is worse than death page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling maybe it something that can kill load of people at once suggested george maybe it some particularly painful way of killing people said ron fearfully he got the cruciatus curse for causing pain said harry he doe not need anything more efficient than that there wa a pause and harry knew that the others like him were wondering what horror this weapon could perpetrate so who dyou think got it now asked george i hope it our side said ron sounding slightly nervous if it is dumbledores probably keeping it said fred where said ron quickly hogwarts bet it is said george that is where he hid the sorcerer stone a weapon going to be a lot bigger than the stone though said ron not necessarily said fred yeah size is no guarantee of power said george look at ginny what dyou mean said harry you have never been on the receiving end of one of her batbogey hex have you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling shhh said fred halfrising from the bed listen they fell silent footstep were coming up the stair again mum said george and without further ado there wa a loud crack and harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed a few second later and they heard the floorboard creak outside their door mr weasley wa plainly listening to see whether they were talking or not hedwig and pigwidgeon hooted dolefully the floorboard creaked again and they heard her heading upstairs to check on fred and george she doe not trust u at all you know said ron regretfully harry wa sure he would not be able to fall asleep the evening had been so packed with thing to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hour mulling it all over he wanted to continue talking to ron but mr weasley wa now creaking back downstairs again and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs in fact manylegged creature were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door and hagrid the care of magical creature teacher wa saying beauty aren they eh harry well be study in weapon this term and harry saw that the creature had cannon for head and were wheeling to face him he ducked the next thing he knew he wa curled in a warm ball under his bedclothes and george loud voice wa filling the room page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling mum say get up your breakfast is in the kitchen and then she need you in the drawing room there are load more doxy than she thought and she is found a nest of dead puffskeins under the sofa half an hour later harry and ron who had dressed and breakfasted quickly entered the drawing room a long highceilinged room on the first floor with olive green wall covered in dirty tapestry the carpet exhaled little cloud of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long mossgreen velvet curtain were buzzing a though swarming with invisible bee it wa around these that mr weasley hermione ginny fred and george were grouped all looking rather peculiar a they had tied cloth over their nose and mouth each of them wa also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end cover your face and take a spray mr weasley said to harry and ron the moment she saw them pointing to two more bottle of black liquid standing on a spindlelegged table it doxycide i have never seen an infestation this bad what that houseelfs been doing for the last ten year hermione s face wa half concealed by a tea towel but harry distinctly saw her throw a reproachful look at mr weasley at these word kreachers really old he probably could not manage you would be surprised what kreacher can manage when he want to hermione said sirius who had just entered the room carrying a bloodstained bag of what appeared to be dead rat i have just been feeding buckbeak he added in reply to harrys inquiring page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling look i keep him upstairs in my mother bedroom anyway this writing desk he dropped the bag of rat onto an armchair then bent over to examine the locked cabinet which harry now noticed for the first time wa shaking slightly well molly i am pretty sure this is a boggart said sirius peering through the keyhole but perhaps we ought to let madeye have a shifty at it before we let it out knowing my mother it could be something much worse right you are sirius said mr weasley they were both speaking in carefully light polite voice that told harry quite plainly that neither had forgotten their disagreement of the night before a loud clanging bell sounded from downstairs followed at once by the cacophony of scream and wail that had been triggered the previous night by tonks knocking over the umbrella stand i keep telling them not to ring the doorbell said sirius exasperatedly hurrying back out of the room they heard him thundering down the stair a mr black screech echoed up through the house once more stain of dishonor filthy halfbreeds blood traitor child of filth close the door please harry said mr weasley harry took a much time a he dared to close the drawing room door he wanted to listen to what wa going on downstairs sirius had obviously managed to shut the curtain over his mother portrait because she had stopped screaming he heard sirius walking down the hall then the clattering of the chain on the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling front door and then a deep voice he recognized a kingsley shacklebolts saying hestia just relieved me so she is got moody cloak now thought id leave a report for dumbledore feeling mr weasleys eye on the back of his head harry regretfully closed the drawing room door and rejoined the doxy party mr weasley wa bending over to check the page on doxy in gilderoy lockharts guide to household pest which wa lying open on the sofa right you lot you need to be careful because doxy bite and their teeth are poisonous i have got a bottle of antidote here but id rather nobody needed it she straightened up positioned herself squarely in front of the curtain and beckoned them all forward when i say the word start spraying immediately she said they will come flying out at u i expect but it say on the spray one good squirt will paralyze them when they are immobilized just throw them in this bucket she stepped carefully out of their line of fire and raised her own spray all right squirti harry had been spraying only a few second when a fully grown doxy came soaring out of a fold in the material shiny beetlelike wing whirring tiny needle sharp teeth bared it fairylike body covered with thick black hair and it four tiny fist clenched with fury harry caught it full in the face with a blast of doxycide it froze in midair and fell with a surprisingly loud thunk onto the worn carpet below harry picked it up and threw it in the bucket page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fred what are you doing said mr weasley sharply spray that at once and throw it away harry looked around fred wa holding a struggling doxy between his forefinger and thumb righto fred said brightly spraying the doxy quickly in the face so that it fainted but the moment mr weasleys back wa turned he pocketed it with a wink we want to experiment with doxy venom for our skiving snackboxes george told harry under his breath deftly spraying two doxy at once a they soared straight for his nose harry moved closer to george and muttered out of the corner of his mouth what are skiving snackboxes range of sweet to make you ill george whispered keeping a wary eye on mr weasleys back not seriously ill mind just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it fred and i have been developing them this summer they are doubleended colorcoded chew if you eat the orange half of the puking pastille you throw up moment you have been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing you swallow the purple half which restores you to full fitness enabling you to pursue the leisure activity of your own choice during an hour that would otherwise have been devoted to unprofitable boredom that is what were putting in the advert anyway whispered fred who had edged over out of mr weasleys line of vision and wa now sweeping a few stray doxy from the floor and adding them to his pocket but they still need a bit of work at the moment our tester are having a bit of trouble page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling stopping puking long enough to swallow the purple end tester u said fred we take it in turn george did the fainting fancy we both tried the nosebleed nougat mum thought wed been dueling said george joke shop still on then harry muttered pretending to be adjusting the nozzle on his spray well we have not had a chance to get premise yet said fred dropping his voice even lower a mr weasley mopped her brow with her scarf before returning to the attack so were running it a a mail order service at the moment we put advertisement in the daily prophet last week all thanks to you mate said george but do not worry mum ha not got a clue she will not read the daily prophet anymore because of it telling lie about you and dumbledore harry grinned he had forced the weasley twin to take the thousandgalleon prize money he had won in the triwizard tournament to help them realize their ambition to open a joke shop but he wa still glad to know that his part in furthering their plan wa unknown to mr weasley who did not think that running a joke shop wa a suitable career for two of her son the dedoxying of the curtain took most of the morning it wa past midday when mr weasley finally removed her protective scarf sank into a sagging armchair and sprang up again with a cry of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling disgust having sat on the bag of dead rat the curtain were no longer buzzing they hung limp and damp from the intensive spraying unconscious doxy lay crammed in the bucket at the foot of them beside a bowl of their black egg at which crookshanks wa now sniffing and fred and george were shooting covetous look i think well tackle those after lunch mr weasley pointed at the dusty glassfronted cabinet standing on either side of the mantelpiece they were crammed with an odd assortment of object a selection of rusty dagger claw a coiled snakeskin a number of tarnished silver box inscribed with language harry could not understand and least pleasant of all an ornate crystal bottle with a large opal set into the stopper full of what harry wa quite sure wa blood the clanging doorbell rang again everyone looked at mr weasley stay here she said firmly snatching up the bag of rat a mr black screech started up again from down below ill bring up some sandwich she left the room closing the door carefully behind her at once everyone dashed over to the window to look down onto the doorstep they could see the top of an unkempt gingery head and a stack of precariously balanced cauldron mundungus said hermione what is he brought all those cauldron for probably looking for a safe place to keep them said harry is not that what he wa doing the night he wa page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling supposed to be tailing me picking up dodgy cauldron yeah you are right said fred a the front door opened mundungus heaved his cauldron through it and disappeared from view blimey mum will not like that he and george crossed to the door and stood beside it listening intently mr black screaming had stopped again mundungus is talking to sirius and kingsley fred muttered frowning with concentration can not hear properly dyou reckon we can risk the extendable ear might be worth it said george i could sneak upstairs and get a pair but at that precise moment there wa an explosion of sound from downstairs that rendered extendable ear quite unnecessary all of them could hear exactly what mr weasley wa shouting at the top of her voice we are not running a hideout for stolen good i love hearing mum shouting at someone else said fred with a satisfied smile on his face a he opened the door an inch or so to allow mr weasley s voice to permeate the room better it make such a nice change completely irresponsible a if we have not got enough to worry about without you dragging stolen cauldron into the house page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the idiot are letting her get into her stride said george shaking his head you have got to head her off early otherwise she build up a head of steam and go on for hour and she is been dying to have a go at mundungus ever since he sneaked off when he wa supposed to be following you harry and there go sirius mum again mr weasleys voice wa lost amid fresh shriek and scream from the portrait in the hall george made to shut the door to drown the noise but before he could do so a houseelf edged into the room except for the filthy rag tied like a loincloth around it middle it wa completely naked it looked very old it skin seemed to be several time too big for it and though it wa bald like all houseelves there wa a quantity of white hair growing out of it large batlike ear it eye were a bloodshot and watery gray and it fleshy nose wa large and rather snoutlike the elf took absolutely no notice of harry and the rest acting a though it could not see them it shuffled hunchbacked slowly and doggedly toward the far end of the room muttering under it breath all the while in a hoarse deep voice like a bullfrog smell like a drain and a criminal to boot but she is no better nasty old blood traitor with her brat messing up my mistress house oh my poor mistress if she knew if she knew the scum they have let in her house what would she say to old kreacher oh the shame of it mudbloods and werewolf and traitor and thief poor old kreacher what can he do hello kreacher said fred very loudly closing the door with a snap page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the houseelf froze in his track stopped muttering and then gave a very pronounced and very unconvincing start of surprise kreacher did not see young master he said turning around and bowing to fred still facing the carpet he added perfectly audibly nasty little brat of a blood traitor it is sorry said george did not catch that last bit kreacher said nothing said the elf with a second bow to george adding in a clear undertone and there is it twin unnatural little beast they are harry did not know whether to laugh or not the elf straightened up eyeing them all very malevolently and apparently convinced that they could not hear him a he continued to mutter and there is the mudblood standing there bold a brass oh if my mistress knew oh how she would cry and there is a new boy kreacher doe not know his name what is he doing here kreacher doe not know this is harry kreacher said hermione tentatively harry potter kreachers pale eye widened and he muttered faster and more furiously than ever the mudblood is talking to kreacher a though she is my friend if kreachers mistress saw him in such company oh what would she say do not call her a mudblood said ron and ginny together very angrily page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it doe not matter hermione whispered he not in his right mind he doe not know what he do not kid yourself hermione he know exactly what he saying said fred eyeing kreacher with great dislike kreacher wa still muttering his eye on harry is it true is it harry potter kreacher can see the scar it must be true that is that boy who stopped the dark lord kreacher wonder how he did it do not we all kreacher said fred what do you want anyway george asked kreacher s huge eye darted onto george kreacher is cleaning he said evasively a likely story said a voice behind harry sirius had come back he wa glowering at the elf from the doorway the noise in the hall had abated perhaps mr weasley and mundungus had moved their argument down into the kitchen at the sight of sirius kreacher flung himself into a ridiculously low bow that flattened his snoutlike nose on the floor stand up straight said sirius impatiently now what are you up to kreacher is cleaning the elf repeated kreacher life to serve the noble house of black and it getting blacker every day it filthy said sirius page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling master always liked his little joke said kreacher bowing again and continuing in an undertone master wa a nasty ungrateful swine who broke his mother heart my mother did not have a heart kreacher sirius snapped she kept herself alive out of pure spite kreacher bowed again and said whatever master say then muttered furiously master is not fit to wipe slime from his mother boot oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw kreacher serving him how she hated him what a disappointment he wa i asked you what you were up to said sirius coldly every time you show up pretending to be cleaning you sneak something off to your room so we can not throw it out kreacher would never move anything from it proper place in master house said the elf then muttered very fast mistress would never forgive kreacher if the tapestry wa thrown out seven century it been in the family kreacher must save it kreacher will not let master and the blood traitor and the brat destroy it i thought it might be that said sirius casting a disdainful look at the opposite wall she will have put another permanent sticking charm on the back of it i do not doubt but if i can get rid of it i certainly will now go away kreacher it seemed that kreacher did not dare disobey a direct order nevertheless the look he gave sirius a he shuffled out past him wa redolent of deepest loathing and he muttered all the way out of the room page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling come back from azkaban ordering kreacher around oh my poor mistress what would she say if she saw the house now scum living in it her treasure thrown out she swore he wa no son of hers and he back they say he a murderer too keep muttering and i will be a murderer said sirius irritably and he slammed the door shut on the elf sirius he not right in the head said hermione pleadingly i do not think he realizes we can hear him he been alone too long said sirius taking mad order from my mother portrait and talking to himself but he wa always a foul little if you just set him free said hermione hopefully maybe we can not set him free he know too much about the order said sirius curtly and anyway the shock would kill him you suggest to him that he leaf this house see how he take it sirius walked across the room where the tapestry kreacher had been trying to protect hung the length of the wall harry and the others followed the tapestry looked immensely old it wa faded and looked a though doxy had gnawed it in place nevertheless the golden thread with which it wa embroidered still glinted brightly enough to show them a sprawling family tree dating back a far a harry could tell to the middle age large word at the very top of the tapestry read the noble and most ancient house of black page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling toujours pur you are not on here said harry after scanning the bottom of the tree i used to be there said sirius pointing at a small round charred hole in the tapestry rather like a cigarette burn my sweet old mother blasted me off after i ran away from home kreachers quite fond of muttering the story under his breath you ran away from home when i wa about sixteen said sirius id had enough where did you go asked harry staring at him your dad place said sirius your grandparent were really good about it they sort of adopted me a a second son yeah i camped out at your dad during the school holiday and then when i wa seventeen i got a place of my own my uncle alphard had left me a decent bit of gold he been wiped off here too that is probably why anyway after that i looked after myself i wa always welcome at mr and mr potter for sunday lunch though but why did you leave sirius smiled bitterly and ran a hand through his long unkempt hair because i hated the whole lot of them my parent with their pureblood mania convinced that to be a black made you practically royal my idiot brother soft enough to believe them that is him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sirius jabbed a finger at the very bottom of the tree at the name regulus black a date of death some fifteen year previously followed the date of birth he wa younger than me said sirius and a much better son a i wa constantly reminded but he died said harry yeah said sirius stupid idiot he joined the death eater you are kidding come on harry have not you seen enough of this house to tell what kind of wizard my family were said sirius testily were were your parent death eater a well no no but believe me they thought voldemort had the right idea they were all for the purification of the wizarding race getting rid of muggleborns and having pureblood in charge they were not alone either there were quite a few people before voldemort showed his true color who thought he had the right idea about thing they got cold foot when they saw what he wa prepared to do to get power though but i bet my parent thought regulus wa a right little hero for joining up at first wa he killed by an auror harry asked tentatively oh no said sirius no he wa murdered by voldemort or on voldemorts order more likely i doubt regulus wa ever important enough to be killed by voldemort in person from what i found out after he died he got in so far then panicked about what he wa being asked to do and tried to back out well you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling do not just hand in your resignation to voldemort it a lifetime of service or death lunch said mr weasleys voice she wa holding her wand high in front of her balancing a huge tray loaded with sandwich and cake on it tip she wa very red in the face and still looked angry the others moved over to her eager for some food but harry remained with sirius who had bent closer to the tapestry i have not looked at this for year there is phineas nigellus my greatgreatgrandfather see least popular headmaster hogwarts ever had and araminta meliflua cousin of my mother tried to force through a ministry bill to make mugglehunting legal and dear aunt elladora she started the family tradition of beheading houseelves when they got too old to carry tea tray of course anytime the family produced someone halfway decent they were disowned i see tonks is not on here maybe that is why kreacher will not take order from her he supposed to do whatever anyone in the family asks him you and tonks are related harry asked surprised oh yeah her mother andromeda wa my favorite cousin said sirius examining the tapestry carefully no andromeda not on here either look he pointed to another small round burn mark between two name bellatrix and narcissa andromeda sister are still here because they made lovely respectable pureblood marriage but andromeda married a muggleborn ted tonks so page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sirius mimed blasting the tapestry with a wand and laughed sourly harry however did not laugh he wa too busy staring at the name to the right of andromeda burn mark a double line of gold embroidery linked narcissa black with lucius malfoy and a single vertical gold line from their name led to the name draco you are related to the malfoys the pureblood family are all interrelated said sirius if you are only going to let your son and daughter marry pureblood your choice is very limited there are hardly any of u left molly and i are cousin by marriage and arthur something like my second cousin once removed but there is no point looking for them on here if ever a family wa a bunch of blood traitor it the weasleys but harry wa now looking at the name to the left of andromeda burn bellatrix black which wa connected by a double line to rodolphus lestrange lestrange harry said aloud the name had stirred something in his memory he knew it from somewhere but for a moment he could not think where though it gave him an odd creeping sensation in the pit of his stomach they are in azkaban said sirius shortly harry looked at him curiously bellatrix and her husband rodolphus came in with barty crouch junior said sirius in the same brusque voice rodolphus s brother rabastan wa with them too page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and harry remembered he had seen bellatrix lestrange inside dumbledores pensieve the strange device in which thought and memory could be stored a tall dark woman with heavylidded eye who had stood at her trial and proclaimed her continuing allegiance to lord voldemort her pride that she had tried to find him after his downfall and her conviction that she would one day be rewarded for her loyalty you never said she wa your doe it matter if she is my cousin snapped sirius a far a i am concerned they are not my family she is certainly not my family i have not seen her since i wa your age unless you count a glimpse of her coming in to azkaban dyou think i am proud of having relative like her sorry said harry quickly i did not mean i wa just surprised that is all it doe not matter do not apologize sirius mumbled at once he turned away from the tapestry his hand deep in his pocket i do not like being back here he said staring across the drawing room i never thought id be stuck in this house again harry understood completely he knew how he would feel if forced when he wa grown up and thought he wa free of the place forever to return and live at number four privet drive it ideal for headquarters of course sirius said my father put every security measure known to wizardkind on it when he lived here it unplottable so muggles could never come and call a if they would have wanted to and now dumbledores added his protection you would be hard put to find a safer house page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling anywhere dumbledores secretkeeper for the order you know nobody can find headquarters unless he tell them personally where it is that note moody showed you last night that wa from dumbledore sirius gave a short barklike laugh if my parent could see the use it wa being put to now well my mother portrait should give you some idea he scowled for a moment then sighed i would not mind if i could just get out occasionally and do something useful i have asked dumbledore whether i can escort you to your hearing a snuffle obviously so i can give you a bit of moral support what dyou think harry felt a though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet he had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best of hearing everything that wa going on it had completely flown his mind at sirius word however the crushing sense of dread returned to him he stared at hermione and the weasleys all tucking into their sandwich and thought how he would feel if they went back to hogwarts without him do not worry sirius said harry looked up and realized that sirius had been watching him i am sure they are going to clear you there is definitely something in the international statute of secrecy about being allowed to use magic to save your own life but if they do expel me said harry quietly can i come back here and live with you sirius smiled sadly well see page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling id feel a lot better about the hearing if i knew i did not have to go back to the dursleys harry pressed him they must be bad if you prefer this place said sirius gloomily hurry up you two or there will not be any food left mr weasley called sirius heaved another great sigh cast a dark look at the tapestry and he and harry went to join the others harry tried his best not to think about the hearing while they emptied the glass cabinet that afternoon fortunately for him it wa a job that required a lot of concentration a many of the object in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelf sirius sustained a bad bite from a silver snuffbox within second his bitten hand had developed an unpleasant crusty covering like a tough brown glove it okay he said examining the hand with interest before tapping it lightly with his wand and restoring it skin to normal must be wartcap powder in there he threw the box aside into the sack where they were depositing the debris from the cabinet harry saw george wrap his own hand carefully in a cloth moment later and sneak the box into his already doxyfilled pocket they found an unpleasantlooking silver instrument something like a manylegged pair of tweezer which scuttled up harrys arm like a spider when he picked it up and attempted to puncture his skin sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled nature nobility a wizarding genealogy there wa a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling musical box that emitted a faintly sinister tinkling tune when wound and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut also a heavy locket that none of them could open a number of ancient seal and in a dusty box an order of merlin first class that had been awarded to sirius grandfather for service to the ministry it mean he gave them a load of gold said sirius contemptuously throwing the medal into the rubbish sack several time kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle thing away under his loincloth muttering horrible curse every time they caught him at it when sirius wrested a large golden ring bearing the black crest from his grip kreacher actually burst into furious tear and left the room sobbing under his breath and calling sirius name harry had never heard before it wa my father said sirius throwing the ring into the sack kreacher wa not quite a devoted to him a to my mother but i still caught him snogging a pair of my father old trouser last week mr weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few day the drawing room took three day to decontaminate finally the only undesirable thing left in it were the tapestry of the black family tree which resisted all their attempt to remove it from the wall and the rattling writing desk moody had not dropped by headquarters yet so they could not be sure what wa inside it they moved from the drawing room to a dining room on the ground floor where they found spider large a saucer lurking in the dresser ron left the room page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hurriedly to make a cup of tea and did not return for an hour and a half the china which bore the black crest and motto wa all thrown unceremoniously into a sack by sirius and the same fate met a set of old photograph in tarnished silver frame all of whose occupant squealed shrilly a the glass covering them smashed snape might refer to their work a cleaning but in harrys opinion they were really waging war on the house which wa putting up a very good fight aided and abetted by kreacher the houseelf kept appearing wherever they were congregated his muttering becoming more and more offensive a he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sack sirius went a far a to threaten him with clothes but kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said master must do a master wish before turning away and muttering very loudly but master will not turn kreacher away no because kreacher know what they are up to oh yes he is plotting against the dark lord yes with these mudbloods and traitor and scum at which sirius ignoring hermiones protest seized kreacher by the back of his loincloth and threw him bodily from the room the doorbell rang several time a day which wa the cue for sirius mother to start shrieking again and for harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpse and snatch of conversation they were able to sneak before mr weasley recalled them to their task snape flitted in and out of the house several time more though to harrys relief they never came facetoface he also caught sight of his transfiguration teacher professor mcgonagall page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling looking very odd in a muggle dress and coat though she also seemed too busy to linger sometimes however the visitor stayed to help tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet and lupin who wa staying in the house with sirius but who left it for long period to do mysterious work for the order helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolt at passersby mundungus redeemed himself slightly in mr weasleys eye by rescuing ron from an ancient set of purple robe that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe despite the fact that he wa still sleeping badly still having dream about corridor and locked door that made his scar prickle harry wa managing to have fun for the first time all summer a long a he wa busy he wa happy when the action abated however whenever he dropped his guard or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadow move across the ceiling the thought of the looming ministry hearing returned to him fear jabbed at his inside like needle a he wondered what wa going to happen to him if he wa expelled the idea wa so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud not even to ron and hermione who though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious look in his direction followed his lead in not mentioning it sometimes he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless ministry official who wa snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the dursleys but he would not go he wa determined on that he would come back here to grimmauld place and live with sirius page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he felt a though a brick had dropped into his stomach when mr weasley turned to him during dinner on wednesday evening and said quietly i have ironed your best clothes for tomorrow morning harry and i want you to wash your hair tonight too a good first impression can work wonder ron hermione fred george and ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chop but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew how am i getting there he asked mr weasley trying to sound unconcerned arthur taking you to work with him said mr weasley gently mr weasley smiled encouragingly at harry across the table you can wait in my office until it time for the hearing he said harry looked over at sirius but before he could ask the question mr weasley had answered it professor dumbledore doe not think it a good idea for sirius to go with you and i must say i think he quite right said sirius through clenched teeth mr weasley pursed her lip when did dumbledore tell you that harry said staring at sirius page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he came last night when you were in bed said mr weasley sirius stabbed moodily at a potato with his fork harry dropped his own eye to his plate the thought that dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel if that were possible even worse page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the ministry of magic harry awoke at halfpast five the next morning a abruptly and completely a if somebody had yelled in his ear for a few moment he lay immobile a the prospect of the hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain then unable to bear it he leapt out of bed and put on his glass mr weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jean and tshirt at the foot of his bed harry scrambled into them the blank picture on the wall sniggered again ron wa lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open fast asleep he did not stir a harry crossed the room stepped out onto the landing and closed the door softly behind him trying not to think of the next time he would see ron when they might no longer be fellow student at hogwarts harry walked quietly down the stair past the head of kreachers ancestor and into the kitchen he had expected it to be empty but it wa not when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voice on the other side and when he pushed it open page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he saw mr and mr weasley sirius lupin and tonks sitting there almost a though they were waiting for him all were fully dressed except mr weasley who wa wearing a quilted purple dressing gown she leapt to her foot the moment he entered breakfast she said a she pulled out her wand and hurried over to the fire mmmorning harry yawned tonks her hair wa blonde and curly this morning sleep all right yeah said harry i have bbbeen up all night she said with another shuddering yawn come and sit down she drew out a chair knocking over the one beside it in the process what do you want harry mr weasley called porridge muffin kipper bacon and egg toast just just toast thanks said harry lupin glanced at harry then said to tonks what were you saying about scrimgeour oh yeah well we need to be a bit more careful he been asking kingsley and me funny question harry felt vaguely grateful that he wa not required to join in the conversation his inside were squirming mr weasley placed a couple of piece of toast and marmalade in front of him he tried to eat but it wa like chewing carpet mr weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his tshirt page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tucking in the label and smoothing out crease across the shoulder he wished she would not and ill have to tell dumbledore i can not do night duty tomorrow i am just tttoo tired tonks finished yawning hugely again ill cover for you said mr weasley i am okay i have got a report to finish anyway mr weasley wa not wearing wizard robe but a pair of pinstriped trouser and an old bomber jacket he turned from tonks to harry how are you feeling harry shrugged it will all be over soon mr weasley said bracingly in a few hour time you will be cleared harry said nothing the hearing on my floor in amelia bone s office she is head of the department of magical law enforcement and she is the one who will be questioning you amelia bone is okay harry said tonks earnestly she is fair she will hear you out harry nodded still unable to think of anything to say do not lose your temper said sirius abruptly be polite and stick to the fact harry nodded again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the law on your side said lupin quietly even underage wizard are allowed to use magic in life threatening situation something very cold trickled down the back of harrys neck for a moment he thought someone wa putting a disillusionment charm on him again then he realized that mr weasley wa attacking his hair with a wet comb she pressed hard on the top of his head doe not it ever lie flat she said desperately harry shook his head mr weasley checked his watch and looked up at harry i think well go now he said were a bit early but i think you will be better off there than hanging around here okay said harry automatically dropping his toast and getting to his foot you will be all right harry said tonks patting him on the arm good luck said lupin i am sure it will be fine and if it not said sirius grimly ill see to amelia bone for you harry smiled weakly mr weasley hugged him we have all got our finger crossed she said right said harry well see you later then page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he followed mr weasley upstairs and along the hall he could hear sirius mother grunting in her sleep behind her curtain mr weasley unbolted the door and they stepped out into the cold gray dawn you do not normally walk to work do you harry asked him a they set off briskly around the square no i usually apparate said mr weasley but obviously you can not and i think it best we arrive in a thoroughly nonmagical fashion make a better impression given what you are being disciplined for mr weasley kept his hand inside his jacket a they walked harry knew it wa clenched around his wand the rundown street were almost deserted but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already full of early morning commuter a ever when he found himself in close proximity to muggles going about their daily business mr weasley wa hard put to contain his enthusiasm simply fabulous he whispered indicating the automatic ticket machine wonderfully ingenious they are out of order said harry pointing at the sign yes but even so said mr weasley beaming fondly at them they bought their ticket instead from a sleepy looking guard harry handled the transaction a mr weasley wa not very good with muggle money and five minute later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off toward the center of london mr weasley kept anxiously checking and rechecking the underground map above the window page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling four stop harry three stop left now two stop to go harry they got off at a station in the very heart of london swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and woman carrying briefcase up the escalator they went through the ticket barrier mr weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket and emerged onto a broad street lined with imposing looking building already full of traffic where are we said mr weasley blankly and for one heartstopping moment harry thought they had gotten off at the wrong station despite mr weasleys continual reference to the map but a second later he said ah yes this way harry and led him down a side road sorry he said but i never come by train and it all look rather different from a muggle perspective a a matter of fact i have never even used the visitor entrance before the farther they walked the smaller and le imposing the building became until finally they reached a street that contained several rather shabbylooking office a pub and an overflowing dumpster harry had expected a rather more impressive location for the ministry of magic here we are said mr weasley brightly pointing at an old red telephone box which wa missing several pane of glass and stood before a heavily graffittied wall after you harry he opened the telephone box door harry stepped inside wondering what on earth this wa about mr weasley folded himself in beside harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and closed the door it wa a tight fit harry wa jammed against the telephone apparatus which wa hanging crookedly from the wall a though a vandal had tried to rip it off mr weasley reached past harry for the receiver mr weasley i think this might be out of order too harry said no no i am sure it fine said mr weasley holding the receiver above his head and peering at the dial let u see six he dialed the number two four and another four and another two a the dial whirred smoothly back into place a cool female voice sounded inside the telephone box not from the receiver in mr weasleys hand but a loudly and plainly a though an invisible woman were standing right beside them welcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and business er said mr weasley clearly uncertain whether he should talk into the receiver or not he compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear arthur weasley misuse of muggle artifact office here to escort harry potter who ha been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing thank you said the cool female voice visitor please take the badge and attach it to the front of your robe there wa a click and a rattle and harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coin usually appeared he picked it up it wa a square silver badge with harry potter page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling disciplinary hearing on it he pinned it to the front of his tshirt a the female voice spoke again visitor to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium the floor of the telephone box shuddered they were sinking slowly into the ground harry watched apprehensively a the pavement rose up past the glass window of the telephone box until darkness closed over their head then he could see nothing at all he could only hear a dull grinding noise a the telephone box made it way down through the earth after about a minute though it felt much longer to harry a chink of golden light illuminated his foot and widening rose up his body until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eye from watering the ministry of magic wish you a pleasant day said the woman voice the door of the telephone box sprang open and mr weasley stepped out of it followed by harry whose mouth had fallen open they were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished dark wood floor the peacockblue ceiling wa inlaid with gleaming golden symbol that were continually moving and changing like some enormous heavenly notice board the wall on each side were paneled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplace set into them every few second a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the lefthand fireplace with a soft whoosh on the righthand side short queue of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wizard were forming before each fireplace waiting to depart halfway down the hall wa a fountain a group of golden statue larger than lifesize stood in the middle of a circular pool tallest of them all wa a noblelooking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air grouped around him were a beautiful witch a centaur a goblin and a houseelf the last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard glittering jet of water were flying from the end of the two wand the point of the centaur arrow the tip of the goblin hat and each of the houseelfs ear so that the tinkling hiss of falling water wa added to the pop and crack of apparators and the clatter of footstep a hundred of witch and wizard most of whom were wearing glum earlymorning look strode toward a set of golden gate at the far end of the hall this way said mr weasley they joined the throng wending their way between the ministry worker some of whom were carrying tottering pile of parchment others battered briefcase still others reading the daily prophet a they walked a they passed the fountain harry saw silver sickle and bronze knut glinting up at him from the bottom of the pool a small smudged sign beside it read all proceeds from the fountain of magical brother will be given to st mungos hospital for magical malady and injury if i am not expelled from hogwarts ill put in ten galleon harry found himself thinking desperately page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling over here harry said mr weasley and they stepped out of the stream of ministry employee heading for the golden gate toward a desk on the left over which hung a sign saying security a badly shaven wizard in peacockblue robe looked up a they approached and put down his daily prophet i am escorting a visitor said mr weasley gesturing toward harry step over here said the wizard in a bored voice harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod thin and flexible a a car aerial and passed it up and down harrys front and back wand grunted the security wizard at harry putting down the golden instrument and holding out his hand harry produced his wand the wizard dropped it onto a strange brass instrument which looked something like a set of scale with only one dish it began to vibrate a narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base the wizard tore this off and read the writing upon it eleven inch phoenixfeather core been in use four year that correct yes said harry nervously i keep this said the wizard impaling the slip of parchment on a small brass spike you get this back he added thrusting the wand at harry thank you hang on said the wizard slowly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling his eye had darted from the silver visitor badge on harrys chest to his forehead thank you eric said mr weasley firmly and grasping harry by the shoulder he steered him away from the desk and back into the stream of wizard and witch walking through the golden gate jostled slightly by the crowd harry followed mr weasley through the gate into the smaller hall beyond where at least twenty lift stood behind wrought golden grille harry and mr weasley joined the crowd around one of them a big bearded wizard holding a large cardboard box stood nearby the box wa emitting rasping noise all right arthur said the wizard nodding at mr weasley what have you got there bob asked mr weasley looking at the box were not sure said the wizard seriously we thought it wa a bogstandard chicken until it started breathing fire look like a serious breach of the ban on experimental breeding to me with a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them the golden grille slid back and harry and mr weasley moved inside it with the rest of the crowd harry found himself jammed against the back wall of the lift several witch and wizard were looking at him curiously he stared at his foot to avoid catching anyones eye flattening his fringe a he did so the grille slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly chain rattling all the while while the same cool female voice harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling level seven department of magical game and sport incorporating the british and irish quidditch league headquarters official gobstones club and ludicrous patent office the lift door opened harry glimpsed an untidy looking corridor with various poster of quidditch team tacked lopsidedly on the wall one of the wizard in the lift who wa carrying an armful of broomstick extricated himself with difficulty and disappeared down the corridor the door closed the lift juddered upward again and the woman voice said level six department of magical transport incorporating the floo network authority broom regulatory control portkey office and apparation test center once again the lift door opened and four or five witch and wizard got out at the same time several paper airplane swooped into the lift harry stared up at them a they flapped idly around above his head they were a pale violet color and he could see ministry of magic stamped along the edge of their wing just interdepartmental memo mr weasley muttered to him we used to use owl but the mess wa unbelievable droppings all over the desk a they clattered upward again the memo flapped around the swaying lamp in the lift ceiling level five department of international magical cooperation incorporating the international magical trading standard body the international magical office of law and the international confederation of wizard british seat page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling when the door opened two of the memo zoomed out with a few more witch and wizard but several more memo zoomed in so that the light from the lamp in the ceiling flickered and flashed a they darted around it level four department for the regulation and control of magical creature incorporating beast being and spirit division goblin liaison office and pest advisory bureau scuse said the wizard carrying the firebreathing chicken and he left the lift pursued by a little flock of memo the door clanged shut yet again level three department of magical accident and catastrophe including the accidental magic reversal squad obliviator headquarters and muggleworthy excuse committee everybody left the lift on this floor except mr weasley harry and a witch who wa reading an extremely long piece of parchment that wa trailing on the ground the remaining memo continued to soar around the lamp a the lift juddered upward again and then the door opened and the voice said level two department of magical law enforcement including the improper use of magic office auror headquarters and wizengamot administration service this is u harry said mr weasley and they followed the witch out of the lift into a corridor lined with door my office is on the other side of the floor mr weasley said harry a they passed a window through which sunlight wa streaming are not we underground page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes we are said mr weasley those are enchanted window magical maintenance decide what weather were getting every day we had two month of hurricane last time they were angling for a pay raise just round here harry they turned a corner walked through a pair of heavy oak door and emerged in a cluttered open area divided into cubicle which were buzzing with talk and laughter memo were zooming in and out of cubicle like miniature rocket a lopsided sign on the nearest cubicle read auror headquarters harry looked surreptitiously through the doorway a they passed the aurors had covered their cubicle wall with everything from picture of wanted wizard and photograph of their family to poster of their favorite quidditch team and article from the daily prophet a scarletrobed man with a ponytail longer than bill wa sitting with his boot up on his desk dictating a report to his quill a little farther along a witch with a patch over her eye wa talking over the top of her cubicle wall to kingsley shacklebolt morning weasley said kingsley carelessly a they drew nearer i have been wanting a word with you have you got a second yes if it really is a second said mr weasley i am in rather a hurry they were talking to each other a though they hardly knew each other and when harry opened his mouth to say hello to kingsley mr weasley stood on his foot they followed kingsley along the row and into the very last cubicle harry received a slight shock sirius face wa blinking down at him from every direction newspaper page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling cutting and old photograph even the one of sirius being best man at the potter wedding papered the wall the only siriusfree space wa a map of the world in which little red pin were glowing like jewel here said kingsley brusquely to mr weasley shoving a sheaf of parchment into his hand i need a much information a possible on flying muggle vehicle sighted in the last twelve month we have received information that black might still be using his old motorcycle kingsley tipped harry an enormous wink and added in a whisper give him the magazine he might find it interesting then he said in normal tone and do not take too long weasley the delay on that firelegs report held our investigation up for a month if you had read my report you would know that the term is firearm said mr weasley coolly and i am afraid you will have to wait for information on motorcycle were extremely busy at the moment he dropped his voice and said if you can get away before seven molly making meatball he beckoned to harry and led him out of kingsleys cubicle through a second set of oak door into another passage turned left marched along another corridor turned right into a dimly lit and distinctly shabby corridor and finally reached a dead end where a door on the left stood ajar revealing a broom cupboard and a door on the right bore a tarnished brass plaque reading misuse of muggle artifact mr weasleys dingy office seemed to be slightly smaller than the broom cupboard two desk had been crammed inside it and there wa barely room to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinet lining the wall on top of which were tottering pile of file the little wall space available bore witness to mr weasleys obsession there were several poster of car including one of a dismantled engine two illustration of postbox he seemed to have cut out of muggle childrens book and a diagram showing how to wire a plug sitting on top of mr weasleys overflowing intray wa an old toaster that wa hiccuping in a disconsolate way and a pair of empty leather glove that were twiddling their thumb a photograph of the weasley family stood beside the intray harry noticed that percy appeared to have walked out of it we have not got a window said mr weasley apologetically taking off his bomber jacket and placing it on the back of his chair we have asked but they do not seem to think we need one have a seat harry doe not look a if perkins is in yet harry squeezed himself into the chair behind perkinss desk while mr weasley rifled through the sheaf of parchment kingsley shacklebolt had given him ah he said grinning a he extracted a copy of a magazine entitled the quibbler from it midst yes he flicked through it yes he right i am sure sirius will find that very amusing oh dear what is this now a memo had just zoomed in through the open door and fluttered to rest on top of the hiccuping toaster mr weasley unfolded it and read aloud third regurgitating public toilet reported in bethnal green kindly investigate immediately this is getting ridiculous page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a regurgitating toilet antimuggle prankster said mr weasley frowning we had two last week one in wimbledon one in elephant and castle muggles are pulling the flush and instead of everything disappearing well you can imagine the poor thing keep calling in those those pumbles i think they are called you know the one who mend pipe and thing plumber exactly yes but of course they are flummoxed i only hope we can catch whoevers doing it will it be aurors who catch them oh no this is too trivial for aurors it will be the ordinary magical law enforcement patrol ah harry this is perkins a stooped timidlooking old wizard with fluffy white hair had just entered the room panting oh arthur he said desperately without looking at harry thank goodness i did not know what to do for the best whether to wait here for you or not i have just sent an owl to your home but you have obviously missed it an urgent message came ten minute ago i know about the regurgitating toilet said mr weasley no no it not the toilet it the potter boy hearing they have changed the time and venue it start at eight of the clock now and it down in old courtroom ten down in old but they told me merlin beard page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling mr weasley looked at his watch let out a yelp and leapt from his chair quick harry we should have been there five minute ago perkins flattened himself against the filing cabinet a mr weasley left the office at a run harry on his heel why have they changed the time harry said breathlessly a they hurtled past the auror cubicle people poked out their head and stared a they streaked past harry felt a though he had left all his inside back at perkinss desk i have no idea but thank goodness we got here so early if you would missed it it would have been catastrophic mr weasley skidded to a halt beside the lift and jabbed impatiently at the down button come on the lift clattered into view and they hurried inside every time it stopped mr weasley cursed furiously and pummelled the number nine button those courtroom have not been used in year said mr weasley angrily i can not think why they are doing it down there unless but no a plump witch carrying a smoking goblet entered the lift at that moment and mr weasley did not elaborate the atrium said the cool female voice and the golden grille slid open showing harry a distant glimpse of the golden statue in the fountain the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling plump witch got out and a sallowskinned wizard with a very mournful face got in morning arthur he said in a sepulchral voice a the lift began to descend do not often see you down here urgent business bode said mr weasley who wa bouncing on the ball of his foot and throwing anxious look over at harry ah yes said bode surveying harry unblinkingly of course harry barely had emotion to spare for bode but his unfaltering gaze did not make him feel any more comfortable department of mystery said the cool female voice and left it at that quick harry said mr weasley a the lift door rattled open and they sped up a corridor that wa quite different from those above the wall were bare there were no window and no door apart from a plain black one set at the very end of the corridor harry expected them to go through it but instead mr weasley seized him by the arm and dragged him to the left where there wa an opening leading to a flight of step down here down here panted mr weasley taking two step at a time the lift doe not even come down this far why they are doing it there they reached the bottom of the step and ran along yet another corridor which bore a great resemblance to that which led to snapes dungeon at hogwarts with rough stone wall and torch in bracket the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling door they passed here were heavy wooden one with iron bolt and keyhole courtroom ten i think were nearly yes mr weasley stumbled to a halt outside a grimy dark door with an immense iron lock and slumped against the wall clutching at a stitch in his chest go on he panted pointing his thumb at the door get in there are not are not you coming with no no i am not allowed good luck harrys heart wa beating a violent tattoo against his adam apple he swallowed hard turned the heavy iron door handle and stepped inside the courtroom page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the hearing harry gasped he could not help himself the large dungeon he had entered wa horribly familiar he had not only seen it before he had been here before this wa the place he had visited inside dumbledores pensieve the place where he had watched the lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in azkaban the wall were made of dark stone dimly lit by torch empty bench rose on either side of him but ahead in the highest bench of all were many shadowy figure they had been talking in low voice but a the heavy door swung closed behind harry an ominous silence fell a cold male voice rang across the courtroom you are late sorry said harry nervously ii did not know the time had changed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling that is not the wizengamots fault said the voice an owl wa sent to you this morning take your seat harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the center of the room the arm of which were covered in chain he had seen those chain spring to life and bind whoever sat between them his footstep echoed loudly a he walked across the stone floor when he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chain clinked rather threateningly but did not bind him feeling rather sick he looked up at the people seated at the bench above there were about fifty of them all a far a he could see wearing plumcolored robe with an elaborately worked silver w on the lefthand side of the chest and all staring down their nose at him some with very austere expression others look of frank curiosity in the very middle of the front row sat cornelius fudge the minister of magic fudge wa a portly man who often sported a limegreen bowler hat though today he had dispensed with it he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to harry a broad squarejawed witch with very short gray hair sat on fudge left she wore a monocle and looked forbidding on fudge right wa another witch but she wa sitting so far back on the bench that her face wa in shadow very well said fudge the accused being present finally let u begin are you ready he called down the row yes sir said an eager voice harry knew ron brother percy wa sitting at the very end of the front bench harry looked at percy expecting some sign of recognition from him but none came percy eye page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling behind his hornrimmed glass were fixed on his parchment a quill poised in his hand disciplinary hearing of the twelfth of august said fudge in a ringing voice and percy began taking note at once into offense committed under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and the international statute of secrecy by harry james potter resident at number four privet drive little whinging surrey interrogator cornelius oswald fudge minister of magic amelia susan bone head of the department of magical law enforcement dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister court scribe percy ignatius weasley witness for the defense albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore said a quiet voice from behind harry who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck dumbledore wa striding serenely across the room wearing long midnightblue robe and a perfectly calm expression his long silver beard and hair gleamed in the torchlight a he drew level with harry and looked up at fudge through the halfmoon spectacle that rested halfway down his very crooked nose the member of the wizengamot were muttering all eye were now on dumbledore some looked annoyed others slightly frightened two elderly witch in the back row however raised their hand and waved in welcome a powerful emotion had risen in harrys chest at the sight of dumbledore a fortified hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him he wanted to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling catch dumbledores eye but dumbledore wa not looking his way he wa continuing to look up at the obviously flustered fudge ah said fudge who looked thoroughly disconcerted dumbledore yes you er got our er message that the time and er place of the hearing had been changed then i must have missed it said dumbledore cheerfully however due to a lucky mistake i arrived at the ministry three hour early so no harm done yes well i suppose well need another chair i weasley could you not to worry not to worry said dumbledore pleasantly he took out his wand gave it a little flick and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to harry dumbledore sat down put the tip of his long finger together and looked at fudge over them with an expression of polite interest the wizengamot wa still muttering and fidgeting restlessly only when fudge spoke again did they settle down yes said fudge again shuffling his note well then so the charge yes he extricated a piece of parchment from the pile before him took a deep breath and read the charge against the accused are a follows that he did knowingly deliberately and in full awareness of the illegality of his action having received a previous written warning from the ministry of magic on a similar charge produce a patronus charm in a muggleinhabited area in the presence of a muggle on august the second at twentythree minute past nine which constitutes an offense under paragraph c page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling of the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery and also under section thirteen of the international confederation of wizard statute of secrecy you are harry james potter of number four privet drive little whinging surrey fudge said glaring at harry over the top of his parchment yes harry said you received an official warning from the ministry for using illegal magic three year ago did you not yes but and yet you conjured a patronus on the night of the second of august said fudge yes said harry but knowing that you are not permitted to use magic outside school while you are under the age of seventeen yes but knowing that you were in an area full of muggles yes but fully aware that you were in close proximity to a muggle at the time yes said harry angrily but i only used it because we were the witch with the monocle on fudge left cut across him in a booming voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you produced a fully fledged patronus yes said harry because a corporeal patronus a what said harry your patronus had a clearly defined form i mean to say it wa more than vapor or smoke yes said harry feeling both impatient and slightly desperate it a stag it always a stag always boomed madam bone you have produced a patronus before now yes said harry i have been doing it for over a year and you are fifteen year old yes and you learned this at school yes professor lupin taught me in my third year because of the impressive said madam bone staring down at him a true patronus at that age very impressive indeed some of the wizard and witch around her were muttering again a few nodded but others were frowning and shaking their head it not a question of how impressive the magic wa said fudge in a testy voice in fact the more page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling impressive the worse it is i would have thought given that the boy did it in plain view of a muggle those who had been frowning now murmured in agreement but it wa the sight of percy sanctimonious little nod that goaded harry into speech i did it because of the dementors he said loudly before anyone could interrupt him again he had expected more muttering but the silence that fell seemed to be somehow denser than before dementors said madam bone after a moment raising her thick eyebrow so that her monocle looked in danger of falling out what do you mean boy i mean there were two dementors down that alleyway and they went for me and my cousin ah said fudge again smirking unpleasantly a he looked around at the wizengamot a though inviting them to share the joke yes yes i thought wed be hearing something like this dementors in little whinging madam bone said in tone of great surprise i do not understand do not you amelia said fudge still smirking let me explain he been thinking it through and decided dementors would make a very nice little cover story very nice indeed muggles can not see dementors can they boy highly convenient highly convenient so it just your word and no witness i am not lying said harry loudly over another outbreak of muttering from the court there were two of them coming from opposite end of the alley page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling everything went dark and cold and my cousin felt them and ran for it enough enough said fudge with a very supercilious look on his face i am sorry to interrupt what i am sure would have been a very wellrehearsed story dumbledore cleared his throat the wizengamot fell silent again we do in fact have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway he said other than dudley dursley i mean fudge plump face seemed to slacken a though somebody had let air out of it he stared down at dumbledore for a moment or two then with the appearance of a man pulling himself back together said we have not got time to listen to more taradiddle i am afraid dumbledore i want this dealt with quickly i may be wrong said dumbledore pleasantly but i am sure that under the wizengamot charter of right the accused ha the right to present witness for his or her case is not that the policy of the department of magical law enforcement madam bone he continued addressing the witch in the monocle true said madam bone perfectly true oh very well very well snapped fudge where is this person i brought her with me said dumbledore she is just outside the door should i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no weasley you go fudge barked at percy who got up at once hurried down the stone step from the judge balcony and hastened past dumbledore and harry without glancing at them a moment later percy returned followed by mr figg she looked scared and more batty than ever harry wished she had thought to change out of her carpet slipper dumbledore stood up and gave mr figg his chair conjuring a second one for himself full name said fudge loudly when mr figg had perched herself nervously on the very edge of her seat arabella doreen figg said mr figg in her quavery voice and who exactly are you said fudge in a bored and lofty voice i am a resident of little whinging close to where harry potter life said mr figg we have no record of any witch or wizard living in little whinging other than harry potter said madam bone at once that situation ha always been closely monitored given given past event i am a squib said mr figg so you would not have me registered would you a squib eh said fudge eyeing her suspiciously well be checking that you will leave detail of your parentage with my assistant weasley incidentally can squib see dementors he added looking left and right along the bench where he sat page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes we can said mr figg indignantly fudge looked back down at her his eyebrow raised very well he said coolly what is your story i had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of wisteria walk shortly after nine on the evening of the second of august gabbled mr figg at once a though she had learned what she wa saying by heart when i heard a disturbance down the alleyway between magnolia crescent and wisteria walk on approaching the mouth of the alleyway i saw dementors running running said madam bone sharply dementors do not run they glide that is what i meant to say said mr figg quickly patch of pink appearing in her withered cheek gliding along the alley toward what looked like two boy what did they look like said madam bone narrowing her eye so that the monocle edge disappeared into her flesh well one wa very large and the other one rather skinny no no said madam bone impatiently the dementors describe them oh said mr figg the pink flush creeping up her neck now they were big big and wearing cloak harry felt a horrible sinking in the pit of his stomach whatever mr figg said to the contrary it sounded to him a though the most she had ever seen wa a picture of a dementor and a picture could never page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling convey the truth of what these being were like the eerie way they moved hovering inch over the ground or the rotting smell of them or that terrible rattling noise they made a they sucked on the surrounding air a dumpy wizard with a large black mustache in the second row leaned close to his neighbor a frizzyhaired witch and whispered something in her ear she smirked and nodded big and wearing cloak repeated madam bone coolly while fudge snorted derisively i see anything else yes said mr figg i felt them everything went cold and this wa a very warm summer night mark you and i felt a though all happiness had gone from the world and i remembered dreadful thing her voice shook and died madam bone eye widened slightly harry could see red mark under her eyebrow where the monocle had dug into it what did the dementors do she asked and harry felt a rush of hope they went for the boy said mr figg her voice stronger and more confident now the pink flush ebbing away from her face one of them had fallen the other wa backing away trying to repel the dementor that wa harry he tried twice and produced silver vapor on the third attempt he produced a patronus which charged down the first dementor and then with his encouragement chased away the second from his cousin and that that wa what happened mr figg finished somewhat lamely page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling madam bone looked down at mr figg in silence fudge wa not looking at her at all but fidgeting with his paper finally he raised his eye and said rather aggressively that is what you saw is it that wa what happened mr figg repeated very well said fudge you may go mr figg cast a frightened look from fudge to dumbledore then got up and shuffled off toward the door again harry heard it thud shut behind her not a very convincing witness said fudge loftily oh i do not know said madam bone in her booming voice she certainly described the effect of a dementor attack very accurately and i can not imagine why she would say they were there if they were not but dementors wandering into a muggle suburb and just happening to come across a wizard snorted fudge the odds on that must be very very long even bagman would not have bet oh i do not think any of u believe the dementors were there by coincidence said dumbledore lightly the witch sitting to the right of fudge with her face in shadow moved slightly but everyone else wa quite still and silent and what is that supposed to mean asked fudge icily it mean that i think they were ordered there said dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i think we might have a record of it if someone had ordered a pair of dementors to go strolling through little whinging barked fudge not if the dementors are taking order from someone other than the ministry of magic these day said dumbledore calmly i have already given you my view on this matter cornelius yes you have said fudge forcefully and i have no reason to believe that your view are anything other than bilge dumbledore the dementors remain in place in azkaban and are doing everything we ask them to then said dumbledore quietly but clearly we must ask ourselves why somebody within the ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of august in the complete silence that greeted these word the witch to the right of fudge leaned forward so that harry saw her for the first time he thought she looked just like a large pale toad she wa rather squat with a broad flabby face a little neck a uncle vernon and a very wide slack mouth her eye were large round and slightly bulging even the little black velvet bow perched on top of her short curly hair put him in mind of a large fly she wa about to catch on a long sticky tongue the chair recognizes dolores jane umbridge senior undersecretary to the minister said fudge the witch spoke in a fluttery girlish highpitched voice that took harry aback he had been expecting a croak page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i am sure i must have misunderstood you professor dumbledore she said with a simper that left her big round eye a cold a ever so silly of me but it sounded for a teensy moment a though you were suggesting that the ministry of magic had ordered an attack on this boy she gave a silvery laugh that made the hair on the back of harrys neck stand up a few other member of the wizengamot laughed with her it could not have been plainer that not one of them wa really amused if it is true that the dementors are taking order only from the ministry of magic and it is also true that two dementors attacked harry and his cousin a week ago then it follows logically that somebody at the ministry might have ordered the attack said dumbledore politely of course these particular dementors may have been outside ministry control there are no dementors outside ministry control snapped fudge who had turned brick red dumbledore inclined his head in a little bow then undoubtedly the ministry will be making a full inquiry into why two dementors were so very far from azkaban and why they attacked without authorization it is not for you to decide what the ministry of magic doe or doe not do dumbledore snapped fudge now a shade of magenta of which uncle vernon would have been proud of course it is not said dumbledore mildly i wa merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he glanced at madam bone who readjusted her monocle and stared back at him frowning slightly i would remind everybody that the behavior of these dementors if indeed they are not figment of this boy imagination is not the subject of this hearing said fudge we are here to examine harry potter offense under the decree for the reasonable restriction of underage sorcery of course we are said dumbledore but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant clause seven of the decree state that magic may be used before muggles in exceptional circumstance and a those exceptional circumstance include situation that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself or witch wizard or muggles present at the time of the we are familiar with clause seven thank you very much snarled fudge of course you are said dumbledore courteously then we are in agreement that harrys use of the patronus charm in these circumstance fall precisely into the category of exceptional circumstance it describes if there were dementors which i doubt you have heard from an eyewitness dumbledore interrupted if you still doubt her truthfulness call her back question her again i am sure she would not object i that not blustered fudge fiddling with the paper before him it i want this over with today dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but naturally you would not care how many time you heard from a witness if the alternative wa a serious miscarriage of justice said dumbledore serious miscarriage my hat said fudge at the top of his voice have you ever bothered to tot up the number of cockandbull story this boy ha come out with dumbledore while trying to cover up his flagrant misuse of magic out of school i suppose you have forgotten the hover charm he used three year ago that wa not me it wa a houseelf said harry you see roared fudge gesturing flamboyantly in harrys direction a houseelf in a muggle house i ask you the houseelf in question is currently in the employ of hogwarts school said dumbledore i can summon him here in an instant to give evidence if you wish i not i have not got time to listen to houseelves anyway that is not the only he blew up his aunt for god sake fudge shouted banging his fist on the judge bench and upsetting a bottle of ink and you very kindly did not press charge on that occasion accepting i presume that even the best wizard can not always control their emotion said dumbledore calmly a fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his note and i have not even started on what he get up to at school but a the ministry ha no authority to punish hogwarts student for misdemeanor at school page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harrys behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry said dumbledore politely a ever but now with a suggestion of coolness behind his word oho said fudge not our business what he doe at school eh you think so the ministry doe not have the power to expel hogwarts student cornelius a i reminded you on the night of the second of august said dumbledore nor doe it have the right to confiscate wand until charge have been successfully proven again a i reminded you on the night of the second of august in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld you appear inadvertently i am sure to have overlooked a few law yourself law can be changed said fudge savagely of course they can said dumbledore inclining his head and you certainly seem to be making many change cornelius why in the few short week since i wa asked to leave the wizengamot it ha already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic a few of the wizard above them shifted uncomfortably in their seat fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce the toadlike witch on his right however merely gazed at dumbledore her face quite expressionless a far a i am aware however dumbledore continued there is no law yet in place that say this court job is to punish harry for every bit of magic he ha ever performed he ha been charged with a specific offense and he ha presented his defense all he and i can do now is to await your verdict page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dumbledore put his fingertip together again and said no more fudge glared at him evidently incensed harry glanced sideways at dumbledore seeking reassurance he wa not at all sure that dumbledore wa right in telling the wizengamot in effect that it wa about time they made a decision again however dumbledore seemed oblivious to harrys attempt to catch his eye he continued to look up at the bench where the entire wizengamot had fallen into urgent whispered conversation harry looked at his foot his heart which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size wa thumping loudly under his rib he had expected the hearing to last longer than this he wa not at all sure that he had made a good impression he had not really said very much he ought to have explained more fully about the dementors about how he had fallen over about how both he and dudley had nearly been kissed twice he looked up at fudge and opened his mouth to speak but his swollen heart wa now constricting his air passage and both time he merely took a deep breath and looked back at his shoe then the whispering stopped harry wanted to look up at the judge but found that it wa really much much easier to keep examining his lace those in favor of clearing the accused of all charge said madam bone s booming voice harrys head jerked upward there were hand in the air many of them more than half breathing very fast he tried to count but before he could finish madam bone had said and those in favor of conviction page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fudge raised his hand so did half a dozen others including the witch on his right and the heavily mustached wizard and the frizzyhaired witch in the second row fudge glanced around at them all looking a though there wa something large stuck in his throat then lowered his own hand he took two deep breath and then said in a voice distorted by suppressed rage very well very well cleared of all charge excellent said dumbledore briskly springing to his foot pulling out his wand and causing the two chintz armchair to vanish well i must be getting along good day to you all and without looking once at harry he swept from the dungeon page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the woe of mr weasley dumbledores abrupt departure took harry completely by surprise he remained sitting where he wa in the chained chair struggling with his feeling of shock and relief the wizengamot were all getting to their foot talking and gathering up their paper and packing them away harry stood up nobody seemed to be paying him the slightest bit of attention except the toadlike witch on fudge right who wa now gazing down at him instead of at dumbledore ignoring her he tried to catch fudge eye or madam bones wanting to ask whether he wa free to go but fudge seemed quite determined not to notice harry and madam bone wa busy with her briefcase so he took a few tentative step toward the exit and when nobody called him back broke into a very fast walk he took the last few step at a run wrenched open the door and almost collided with mr weasley who wa standing right outside looking pale and apprehensive page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dumbledore did not say cleared harry said pulling the door closed behind him of all charge beaming mr weasley seized harry by the shoulder harry that is wonderful well of course they could not have found you guilty not on the evidence but even so i can not pretend i wa not but mr weasley broke off because the courtroom door had just opened again the wizengamot were filing out merlin beard said mr weasley wonderingly pulling harry aside to let them all pas you were tried by the full court i think so said harry quietly one or two of the passing wizard nodded to harry a they passed and a few including madam bone said morning arthur to mr weasley but most averted their eye cornelius fudge and the toadlike witch were almost the last to leave the dungeon fudge acted a though mr weasley and harry were part of the wall but again the witch looked almost appraisingly at harry a she passed last of all to pas wa percy like fudge he completely ignored his father and harry he marched past clutching a large roll of parchment and a handful of spare quill his back rigid and his nose in the air the line around mr weasleys mouth tightened slightly but other than this he gave no sign that he had noticed his third son i am going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news he said beckoning harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling forward a percy heel disappeared up the stair to the ninth level ill drop you off on the way to that toilet in bethnal green come on so what will you have to do about the toilet harry asked grinning everything suddenly seemed five time funnier than usual it wa starting to sink in he wa cleared he wa going hack to hogwarts oh it a simple enough antijinx said mr weasley a they mounted the stair but it not so much having to repair the damage it more the attitude behind the vandalism harry mugglebaiting might strike some wizard a funny but it an expression of something much deeper and nastier and i for one mr weasley broke off in midsentence they had just reached the ninthlevel corridor and cornelius fudge wa standing a few foot away from them talking quietly to a tall man with sleek blond hair and a pointed pale face the second man turned at the sound of their footstep he too broke off in midconversation his cold gray eye narrowed and fixed upon harrys face well well well patronus potter said lucius malfoy coolly harry felt winded a though he had just walked into something heavy he had last seen those cool gray eye through slit in a death eater hood and last heard that man voice jeering in a dark graveyard while lord voldemort tortured him he could not believe that lucius malfoy dared look him in the face he could not believe that he wa here in the ministry of magic or that cornelius fudge wa talking to him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling when harry had told fudge mere week ago that malfoy wa a death eater the minister wa just telling me about your lucky escape potter drawled mr malfoy quite astonishing the way you continue to wriggle out of very tight hole snakelike in fact mr weasley gripped harrys shoulder in warning yeah said harry yeah i am good at escaping lucius malfoy raised his eye to mr weasleys face and arthur weasley too what are you doing here arthur i work here said mr weasley shortly not here surely said mr malfoy raising his eyebrow and glancing toward the door over mr weasleys shoulder i thought you were up on the second floor do not you do something that involves sneaking muggle artifact home and bewitching them no said mr weasley curtly his finger now biting into harrys shoulder what are you doing here anyway harry asked lucius malfoy i do not think private matter between myself and the minister are any concern of yours potter said malfoy smoothing the front of his robe harry distinctly heard the gentle clinking of what sounded like a full pocket of gold really just because you are dumbledores favorite boy you must not expect the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling same indulgence from the rest of u shall we go up to your office then minister certainly said fudge turning his back on harry and mr weasley this way lucius they strode off together talking in low voice mr weasley did not let go of harrys shoulder until they had disappeared into the lift why wa not he waiting outside fudge office if they have got business to do together harry burst out furiously what wa he doing down here trying to sneak down to the courtroom if you ask me said mr weasley looking extremely agitated a he glanced over his shoulder a though making sure they could not be overheard trying to find out whether you would been expelled or not ill leave a note for dumbledore when i drop you off he ought to know malfoys been talking to fudge again what private business have they got together anyway gold i expect said mr weasley angrily malfoys been giving generously to all sort of thing for year get him in with the right people then he can ask favor delay law he doe not want passed oh he very well connected lucius malfoy the lift arrived it wa empty except for a flock of memo that flapped around mr weasleys head a he pressed the button for the atrium and the door clanged shut he waved them away irritably mr weasley said harry slowly if fudge is meeting death eater like malfoy if he seeing them alone page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling how do we know they have not put the imperius curse on him do not think it had not occurred to u harry muttered mr weasley but dumbledore think fudge is acting of his own accord at the moment which a dumbledore say is not a lot of comfort best not talk about it anymore just now harry the door slid open and they stepped out into the now almostdeserted atrium eric the security man wa hidden behind his daily prophet again they had walked straight past the golden fountain before harry remembered wait he told mr weasley and pulling his money bag from his pocket he turned back to the fountain he looked up into the handsome wizard face but up close harry thought he looked rather weak and foolish the witch wa wearing a vapid smile like a beauty contestant and from what harry knew of goblin and centaur they were most unlikely to be caught staring this soppily at human of any description only the houseelfs attitude of creeping servility looked convincing with a grin at the thought of what hermione would say if she could see the statue of the elf harry turned his money bag upside down and emptied not just ten galleon but the whole content into the pool at the statue foot i knew it yelled ron punching the air you always get away with stuff they were bound to clear you said hermione who had looked positively faint with anxiety when harry had entered the kitchen and wa now holding a shaking hand over her eye there wa no case against you none at all page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling everyone seems quite relieved though considering they all knew id get off said harry smiling mr weasley wa wiping her face on her apron and fred george and ginny were doing a kind of war dance to a chant that went he got off he got off he got off that is enough settle down shouted mr weasley though he too wa smiling listen sirius lucius malfoy wa at the ministry what said sirius sharply he got off he got off he got off be quiet you three yes we saw him talking to fudge on level nine then they went up to fudge office together dumbledore ought to know absolutely said sirius well tell him do not worry well id better get going there is a vomiting toilet in bethnal green waiting for me molly ill be late i am covering for tonks but kingsley might be dropping in for dinner he got off he got off he got off that is enough fred george ginny said mr weasley a mr weasley left the kitchen harry dear come and sit down have some lunch you hardly ate breakfast ron and hermione sat themselves down opposite him looking happier than they had done since he had first arrived at number twelve grimmauld place and harrys feeling of giddy relief which had been somewhat dented by his encounter with lucius page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling malfoy swelled again the gloomy house seemed warmer and more welcoming all of a sudden even kreacher looked le ugly a he poked his snoutlike nose into the kitchen to investigate the source of all the noise course once dumbledore turned up on your side there wa no way they were going to convict you said ron happily now dishing great mound of mashed potato onto everyone is plate yeah he swung it for me said harry he felt that it would sound highly ungrateful not to mention childish to say i wish he would talked to me though or even looked at me and a he thought this the scar on his forehead burned so badly that he clapped his hand to it what is up said hermione looking alarmed scar harry mumbled but it nothing it happens all the time now none of the others had noticed a thing all of them were now helping themselves to food while gloating over harrys narrow escape fred george and ginny were still singing hermione looked rather anxious but before she could say anything ron said happily i bet dumbledore turn up this evening to celebrate with u you know i do not think hell be able to ron said mr weasley setting a huge plate of roast chicken down in front of harry he really very busy at the moment he got off he got off he got off shut up roared mr weasley page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling over the next few day harry could not help noticing that there wa one person within number twelve grimmauld place who did not seem wholly overjoyed that he would be returning to hogwarts sirius had put up a very good show of happiness on first hearing the news wringing harrys hand and beaming just like the rest of them soon however he wa moodier and surlier than before talking le to everybody even harry and spending increasing amount of time shut up in his mother room with buckbeak do not you go feeling guilty said hermione sternly after harry had confided some of his feeling to her and ron while they scrubbed out a moldy cupboard on the third floor a few day later you belong at hogwarts and sirius know it personally i think he being selfish that is a bit harsh hermione said ron frowning a he attempted to prize off a bit of mold that had attached itself firmly to his finger you would not want to be stuck inside this house without company hell have company said hermione it headquarters to the order of the phoenix is not it he just got his hope up that harry would be coming to live here with him i do not think that is true said harry wringing out his cloth he would not give me a straight answer when i asked him if i could he just did not want to get his own hope up even more said hermione wisely and he probably felt a bit guilty himself because i think a part of him wa really hoping you would be expelled then you would both be outcast together page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling come off it said harry and ron together but hermione merely shrugged suit yourselves but i sometimes think ron mum right and sirius get confused about whether you are you or your father harry so you think he touched in the head said harry heatedly no i just think he been very lonely for a long time said hermione simply at this point mr weasley entered the bedroom behind them still not finished she said poking her head into the cupboard i thought you might be here to tell u to have a break said ron bitterly dyou know how much mold we have got rid of since we arrived here you were so keen to help the order said mr weasley you can do your bit by making headquarters fit to live in i feel like a houseelf grumbled ron well now that you understand what dreadful life they lead perhaps you will be a bit more active in spew said hermione hopefully a mr weasley left them to it again you know maybe it would not be a bad idea to show people exactly how horrible it is to clean all the time we could do a sponsored scrub of gryffindor common room all proceeds to spew it would raise awareness a well a fund page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ill sponsor you to shut up about spew ron muttered irritably but only so harry could hear him harry found himself daydreaming about hogwarts more and more a the end of the holiday approached he could not wait to see hagrid again to play quidditch even to stroll across the vegetable patch to the herbology greenhouse it would be a treat just to leave this dusty musty house where half of the cupboard were still bolted shut and kreacher wheezed insult out of the shadow a you passed though harry wa careful not to say any of this within earshot of sirius the fact wa that living at the headquarters of the antivoldemort movement wa not nearly a interesting or exciting a harry would have expected before he would experienced it though member of the order of the phoenix came and went regularly sometimes staying for meal sometimes only for a few minute whispered conversation mr weasley made sure that harry and the others were kept well out of earshot whether extendable or normal and nobody not even sirius seemed to feel that harry needed to know anything more than he had heard on the night of his arrival on the very last day of the holiday harry wa sweeping up hedwigs owl droppings from the top of the wardrobe when ron entered their bedroom carrying a couple of envelope booklists have arrived he said throwing one of the envelope up to harry who wa standing on a chair about time i thought they would forgotten they usually come much earlier than this harry swept the last of the droppings into a rubbish bag and threw the bag over ron head into the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wastepaper basket in the corner which swallowed it and belched loudly he then opened his letter it contained two piece of parchment one the usual reminder that term started on the first of september the other telling him which book he would need for the coming year only two new one he said reading the list the standard book of spell grade by miranda goshawk and defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard crack fred and george apparated right beside harry he wa so used to them doing this by now that he did not even fall off his chair we were just wondering who assigned the slinkhard book said fred conversationally because it mean dumbledores found a new defense against the dark art teacher said george and about time too said fred what dyou mean harry asked jumping down beside them well we overheard mum and dad talking on the extendable ear a few week back fred told harry and from what they were saying dumbledore wa having real trouble finding anyone to do the job this year not surprising is it when you look at what is happened to the last four said george page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling one sacked one dead one memory removed and one locked in a trunk for nine month said harry counting them off on his finger yeah i see what you mean what is up with you ron asked fred ron did not answer harry looked around ron wa standing very still with his mouth slightly open gaping at his letter from hogwarts what is the matter said fred impatiently moving around ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment freds mouth fell open too prefect he said staring incredulously at the letter prefect george leapt forward seized the envelope in ron other hand and turned it upside down harry saw something scarlet and gold fall into george palm no way said george in a hushed voice there is been a mistake said fred snatching the letter out of ron grasp and holding it up to the light a though checking for a watermark no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect the twin head turned in unison and both of them stared at harry we thought you were a cert said fred in a tone that suggested harry had tricked them in some way we thought dumbledore wa bound to pick you said george indignantly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling winning the triwizard and everything said fred i suppose all the mad stuff must have counted against him said george to fred yeah said fred slowly yeah you have caused too much trouble mate well at least one of yous got their priority right he strode over to harry and clapped him on the back while giving ron a scathing look prefect ickle ronnie the prefect oh mum going to be revolting groaned george thrusting the prefect badge back at ron a though it might contaminate him ron who still had not said a word took the badge stared at it for a moment and then held it out to harry a though asking mutely for confirmation that it wa genuine harry took it a large p wa superimposed on the gryffindor lion he had seen a badge just like this on percy chest on his very first day at hogwarts the door banged open hermione came tearing into the room her cheek flushed and her hair flying there wa an envelope in her hand did you did you get she spotted the badge in harrys hand and let out a shriek i knew it she said excitedly brandishing her letter me too harry me too page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no said harry quickly pushing the badge back into ron hand it ron not me it what ron prefect not me harry said ron said hermione her jaw dropping but are you sure i mean she turned red a ron looked around at her with a defiant expression on his face it my name on the letter he said i said hermione looking thoroughly bewildered i well wow well done ron that is really unexpected said george nodding no said hermione blushing harder than ever no it not ron done load of he really the door behind her opened a little wider and mr weasley backed into the room carrying a pile of freshly laundered robe ginny said the booklists had come at last she said glancing around at all the envelope a she made her way over to the bed and started sorting the robe into two pile if you give them to me ill take them over to diagon alley this afternoon and get your book while you are packing ron ill have to get you more pajama these are at least six inch too short i can not believe how fast you are growing what color would you like get him red and gold to match his badge said george smirking page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling match his what said mr weasley absently rolling up a pair of maroon sock and placing them on ron pile his badge said fred with the air of getting the worst over quickly his lovely shiny new prefect badge freds word took a moment to penetrate mr weasleys preoccupation about pajama his but ron you are not ron held up his badge mr weasley let out a shriek just like hermiones i do not believe it i do not believe it oh ron how wonderful a prefect that is everyone in the family what are fred and i nextdoor neighbor said george indignantly a his mother pushed him aside and flung her arm around her youngest son wait until your father hears ron i am so proud of you what wonderful news you could end up head boy just like bill and percy it the first step oh what a thing to happen in the middle of all this worry i am just thrilled oh ronnie fred and george were both making loud retching noise behind her back but mr weasley did not notice arm tight around ron neck she wa kissing him all over his face which had turned a brighter scarlet than his badge mum do not mum get a grip he muttered trying to push her away page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she let go of him and said breathlessly well what will it be we gave percy an owl but you have already got one of course wwhat do you mean said ron looking a though he did not dare believe his ear you have got to have a reward for this said mr weasley fondly how about a nice new set of dress robe we have already bought him some said fred sourly who looked a though he sincerely regretted this generosity or a new cauldron charlies old one rusting through or a new rat you always liked scabbers mum said ron hopefully can i have a new broom mr weasleys face fell slightly broomstick were expensive not a really good one ron hastened to add just just a new one for a change mr weasley hesitated then smiled of course you can well id better get going if i have got a broom to buy too ill see you all later little ronnie a prefect and do not forget to pack your trunk a prefect oh i am all of a dither she gave ron yet another kiss on the cheek sniffed loudly and bustled from the room fred and george exchanged look page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you do not mind if we do not kiss you do you ron said fred in a falsely anxious voice we could curtsy if you like said george oh shut up said ron scowling at them or what said fred an evil grin spreading across his face going to put u in detention id love to see him try sniggered george he could if you do not watch out said hermione angrily at which fred and george burst out laughing and ron muttered drop it hermione were going to have to watch our step george said fred pretending to tremble with these two on our case yeah it look like our lawbreaking day are finally over said george shaking his head and with another loud crack the twin disapparated those two said hermione furiously staring up at the ceiling through which they could now hear fred and george roaring with laughter in the room upstairs do not pay any attention to them ron they are only jealous i do not think they are said ron doubtfully also looking up at the ceiling they have always said only prat become prefect still he added on a happier note they have never had new broom i wish i could go with mum and choose she will never be able to afford a nimbus but there is the new cleansweep out that would be great yeah i think ill go and tell her i like the cleansweep just so she know page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he dashed from the room leaving harry and hermione alone for some reason harry found that he did not want to look at hermione he turned to his bed picked up the pile of clean robe mr weasley had laid upon it and crossed the room to his trunk harry said hermione tentatively well done said harry so heartily it did not sound like his voice at all and still not looking at her brilliant prefect great thanks said hermione erm harry could i borrow hedwig so i can tell mum and dad they will be really pleased i mean prefect is something they can understand yeah no problem said harry still in the horrible hearty voice that did not belong to him take her he leaned over his trunk laid the robe on the bottom of it and pretended to be rummaging for something while hermione crossed to the wardrobe and called hedwig down a few moment passed harry heard the door close but remained bent double listening the only sound he could hear were the blank picture on the wall sniggering again and the wastepaper basket in the corner coughing up the owl droppings he straightened up and looked behind him hermione and hedwig had gone harry returned slowly to his bed and sank onto it gazing unseeingly at the foot of the wardrobe he had forgotten completely about prefect being chosen in the fifth year he had been too anxious page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badge must be winging their way toward certain people but if he had remembered if he had thought about it what would he have expected not this said a small and truthful voice inside his head harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hand he could not lie to himself if he had known the prefect badge wa on it way he would have expected it to come to him not ron did this make him a arrogant a draco malfoy did he think himself superior to everyone else did he really believe he wa better than ron no said the small voice defiantly wa that true harry wondered anxiously probing his own feeling i am better at quidditch said the voice but i am not better at anything else that wa definitely true harry thought he wa no better than ron in lesson but what about outside lesson what about those adventure he ron and hermione had had together since they had started at hogwarts often risking much worse than expulsion well ron and hermione were with me most of the time said the voice in harrys head not all the time though harry argued with himself they did not fight quirrell with me they did not take on riddle and the basilisk they did not get rid of all those dementors the night sirius escaped they were not in that graveyard with me the night voldemort returned page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again i have definitely done more harry thought indignantly i have done more than either of them but maybe said the small voice fairly maybe dumbledore doe not choose prefect because they have got themselves into a load of dangerous situation maybe he chooses them for other reason ron must have something you do not harry opened his eye and stared through his finger at the wardrobe clawed foot remembering what fred had said no one in their right mind would make ron a prefect harry gave a small snort of laughter a second later he felt sickened with himself ron had not asked dumbledore to give him the prefect badge this wa not ron fault wa he harry ron best friend in the world going to sulk because he did not have a badge laugh with the twin behind ron back ruin this for ron when for the first time he had beaten harry at something at this point harry heard ron footstep on the stair again he stood up straightened his glass and hitched a grin onto his face a ron bounded back through the door just caught her he said happily she say she will get the cleansweep if she can cool harry said and he wa relieved to hear that his voice had stopped sounding hearty listen ron well done mate page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the smile faded off ron face i never thought it would be me he said shaking his head i thought it would be you nah i have caused too much trouble harry said echoing fred yeah said ron yeah i suppose well wed better get our trunk packed had not we it wa odd how widely their possession seemed to have scattered themselves since they had arrived it took them most of the afternoon to retrieve their book and belonging from all over the house and stow them back inside their school trunk harry noticed that ron kept moving his prefect badge around first placing it on his bedside table then putting it into his jean pocket then taking it out and laying it on his folded robe a though to see the effect of the red on the black only when fred and george dropped in and offered to attach it to his forehead with a permanent sticking charm did he wrap it tenderly in his maroon sock and lock it in his trunk mr weasley returned from diagon alley around six of the clock laden with book and carrying a long package wrapped in thick brown paper that ron took from her with a moan of longing never mind unwrapping it now people are arriving for dinner i want you all downstairs she said but the moment she wa out of sight ron ripped off the paper in a frenzy and examined every inch of his new broom an ecstatic expression on his face down in the basement mr weasley had hung a scarlet banner over the heavily laden dinner table page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling which read congratulation ron and hermione new prefect she looked in a better mood than harry had seen her all holiday i thought wed have a little party not a sitdown dinner she told harry ron hermione fred george and ginny a they entered the room your father and bill are on their way ron i have sent them both owl and they are thrilled she added beaming fred rolled his eye sirius lupin tonks and kingsley shacklebolt were already there and madeye moody stumped in shortly after harry had got himself a butterbeer oh alastor i am glad you are here said mr weasley brightly a madeye shrugged off his traveling cloak we have been wanting to ask you for age could you have a look in the writing desk in the drawing room and tell u what is inside it we have not wanted to open it just in case it something really nasty no problem molly moody electricblue eye swiveled upward and stared fixedly through the ceiling of the kitchen drawing room he growled a the pupil contracted desk in the corner yeah i see it yeah it a boggart want me to go up and get rid of it molly no no ill do it myself later beamed mr weasley you have your drink were having a little bit of a celebration actually she gestured at the scarlet banner fourth prefect in the family she said fondly ruffling ron hair page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling prefect eh growled moody his normal eye on ron and his magical eye swiveling around to gaze into the side of his head harry had the very uncomfortable feeling it wa looking at him and moved away toward sirius and lupin well congratulation said moody still glaring at ron with his normal eye authority figure always attract trouble but i suppose dumbledore think you can withstand most major jinx or he would not have appointed you ron looked rather startled at this view of the matter but wa saved the trouble of responding by the arrival of his father and eldest brother mr weasley wa in such a good mood she did not even complain that they had brought mundungus with them too he wa wearing a long overcoat that seemed oddly lumpy in unlikely place and declined the offer to remove it and put it with moody traveling cloak well i think a toast is in order said mr weasley when everyone had a drink he raised his goblet to ron and hermione the new gryffindor prefect ron and hermione beamed a everyone drank to them and then applauded i wa never a prefect myself said tonks brightly from behind harry a everybody moved toward the table to help themselves to food her hair wa tomato red and waist length today she looked like ginnys older sister my head of house said i lacked certain necessary quality like what said ginny who wa choosing a baked potato like the ability to behave myself said tonks page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ginny laughed hermione looked a though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it what about you sirius ginny asked thumping hermione on the back sirius who wa right beside harry let out his usual barklike laugh no one would have made me a prefect i spent too much time in detention with james lupin wa the good boy he got the badge i think dumbledore might have hoped that i would be able to exercise some control over my best friend said lupin i need scarcely say that i failed dismally harrys mood suddenly lifted his father had not been a prefect either all at once the party seemed much more enjoyable he loaded up his plate feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room ron wa rhapsodizing about his new broom to anybody who would listen naught to seventy in ten second not bad is it when you think the comet two ninety only naught to sixty and that is with a decent tailwind according to which broomstick hermione wa talking very earnestly to lupin about her view of elf right i mean it the same kind of nonsense a werewolf segregation is not it it all stem from this horrible thing wizard have of thinking they are superior to other creature page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling mr weasley and bill were having their usual argument about bill hair getting really out of hand and you are so good looking it would look much better shorter would not it harry oh i do not know said harry slightly alarmed at being asked his opinion he slid away from them in the direction of fred and george who were huddled in a corner with mundungus mundungus stopped talking when he saw harry but fred winked and beckoned harry closer it okay he told mundungus we can trust harry he our financial backer look what dung gotten u said george holding out his hand to harry it wa full of what looked like shriveled black pod a faint rattling noise wa coming from them even though they were completely stationary venomous tentacula seed said george we need them for the skiving snackboxes but they are a class c nontradeable substance so we have been having a bit of trouble getting hold of them ten galleon the lot then dung said fred wiv all the trouble i went to to get them said mundungus his saggy bloodshot eye stretching even wider i am sorry lad but i am not taking a knut under twenty dung like his little joke fred said to harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah his best one so far ha been six sickle for a bag of knarl quill said george be careful harry warned them quietly what said fred mum busy cooing over prefect ron were okay but moody could have his eye on you harry pointed out mundungus looked nervously over his shoulder good point that he grunted all right lad ten it is if you will take them quick cheer harry said fred delightedly when mundungus had emptied his pocket into the twin outstretched hand and scuttled off toward the food wed better get these upstairs harry watched them go feeling slightly uneasy it had just occurred to him that mr and mr weasley would want to know how fred and george were financing their joke shop business when a wa inevitable they finally found out about it giving the twin his triwizard winning had seemed a simple thing to do at the time but what if it led to another family row and a percylike estrangement would mr weasley still feel that harry wa a good a her son if she found out he had made it possible for fred and george to start a career she thought quite unsuitable standing where the twin had left him with nothing but a guilty weight in the pit of his stomach for company harry caught the sound of his own name kingsley shacklebolts deep voice wa audible even over the surrounding chatter page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling why dumbledore did not make potter a prefect said kingsley hell have had his reason replied lupin but it would have shown confidence in him it what i would have done persisted kingsley specially with the daily prophet having a go at him every few day harry did not look around he did not want lupin or kingsley to know he had heard he followed mundungus back toward the table though not remotely hungry his pleasure in the party had evaporated a quickly a it had come he wished he were upstairs in bed madeye moody wa sniffing at a chicken leg with what remained of his nose evidently he could not detect any trace of poison because he then tore a strip off it with his teeth the handle made of spanish oak with antijinx varnish and inbuilt vibration control ron wa saying to tonks mr weasley yawned widely well i think ill sort out that boggart before i turn in arthur i do not want this lot up too late all right night harry dear she left the kitchen harry set down his plate and wondered whether he could follow her without attracting attention you all right potter grunted moody yeah fine lied harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling moody took a swig from his hip flask his electric blue eye staring sideways at harry come here i have got something that might interest you he said from an inner pocket of his robe moody pulled a very tattered old wizarding photograph original order of the phoenix growled moody found it last night when i wa looking for my spare invisibility cloak seeing a podmore ha not had the manner to return my best one thought people might like to see it harry took the photograph a small crowd of people some waving at him others lifting their glass looked back up at him there is me said moody unnecessarily pointing at himself the moody in the picture wa unmistakable though his hair wa slightly le gray and his nose wa intact and there is dumbledore beside me dedalus diggle on the other side that is marlene mckinnon she wa killed two week after this wa taken they got her whole family that is frank and alice longbottom harrys stomach already uncomfortable clenched a he looked at alice longbottom he knew her round friendly face very well even though he had never met her because she wa the image of her son neville poor devil growled moody better dead than what happened to them and that is emmeline vance you have met her and that there is lupin obviously benjy fenwick he copped it too we only ever found bit of him shift aside there he added poking the picture and the little photographic people edged page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sideways so that those who were partially obscured could move to the front that is edgar bone brother of amelia bone they got him and his family too he wa a great wizard sturgis podmore blimey he look young caradoc dearborn vanished six month after this we never found his body hagrid of course look exactly the same a ever elphias doge you have met him id forgotten he used to wear that stupid hat gideon prewett it took five death eater to kill him and his brother fabian they fought like hero budge along budge along the little people in the photograph jostled among themselves and those hidden right at the back appeared at the forefront of the picture that is dumbledores brother aberforth only time i ever met him strange bloke that is dorcas meadowes voldemort killed her personally sirius when he still had short hair and there you go thought that would interest you harrys heart turned over his mother and father were beaming up at him sitting on either side of a small wateryeyed man harry recognized at once a wormtail he wa the one who had betrayed their whereabouts to voldemort and so helped bring about their death eh said moody harry looked up into moody heavily scarred and pitted face evidently moody wa under the impression he had just given harry a bit of a treat yeah said harry attempting to grin again er listen i have just remembered i have not packed my page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he wa spared the trouble of inventing an object he had not packed sirius had just said what is that you have got there madeye and moody had turned toward him harry crossed the kitchen slipped through the door and up the stair before anyone could call him back he did not know why he had received such a shock he had seen his parent picture before after all and he had met wormtail but to have them sprung on him like that when he wa least expecting it no one would like that he thought angrily and then to see them surrounded by all those other happy face benjy fenwick who had been found in bit and gideon prewett who had died like a hero and the longbottoms who had been tortured into madness all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore not knowing that they were doomed well moody might find that interesting he harry found it disturbing harry tiptoed up the stair in the hall past the stuffed elf head glad to be on his own again but a he approached the first landing he heard noise someone wa sobbing in the drawing room hello harry said there wa no answer but the sobbing continued he climbed the remaining stair two at a time walked across the landing and opened the drawingroom door someone wa cowering against the dark wall her wand in her hand her whole body shaking with sob sprawled on the dusty old carpet in a patch of moonlight clearly dead wa ron page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling all the air seemed to vanish from harrys lung he felt a though he were falling through the floor his brain turned icy cold ron dead no it could not be but wait a moment it could not be ron wa downstairs mr weasley harry croaked rrriddikulus mr weasley sobbed pointing her shaking wand at ron body crack ron body turned into bill spreadeagled on his back his eye wide open and empty mr weasley sobbed harder than ever rriddikulus she sobbed again crack mr weasleys body replaced bill his glass askew a trickle of blood running down his face no mr weasley moaned no riddikulus riddikulusl riddikulusl crack dead twin crack dead percy crack dead harry mr weasley just get out of here shouted harry staring down at his own dead body on the floor let someone else what is going on page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling lupin had come running into the room closely followed by sirius with moody stumping along behind them lupin looked from mr weasley to the dead harry on the floor and seemed to understand in an instant pulling out his own wand he said very firmly and clearly riddikulusv harrys body vanished a silvery orb hung in the air over the spot where it had lain lupin waved his wand once more and the orb vanished in a puff of smoke oh oh oh gulped mr weasley and she broke into a storm of cry her face in her hand molly said lupin bleakly walking over to her molly do not next second she wa sobbing her heart out on lupin shoulder molly it wa just a boggart he said soothingly patting her on the head just a stupid boggart i see them dddead all the time mr weasley moaned into his shoulder all the tttime i dd dream about it sirius wa staring at the patch of carpet where the boggart pretending to be harrys body had lain moody wa looking at harry who avoided his gaze he had a funny feeling moody magical eye had followed him all the way out of the kitchen dddont tell arthur mr weasley wa gulping now mopping her eye frantically with her cuff i d ddont want him to know being silly lupin handed her a handkerchief and she blew her nose page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry i am so sorry what must you think of me she said shakily not even able to get rid of a boggart do not be stupid said harry trying to smile i am just ssso worried she said tear spilling out of her eye again half the fffamilys in the order it will bbbe a miracle if we all come through this and p ppercys not talking to u what if something dd dreadful happens and we had never mmmade up and what is going to happen if arthur and i get killed who is gggoing to look after ron and ginny molly that is enough said lupin firmly this is not like last time the order is better prepared we have got a head start we know what voldemorts up to mr weasley gave a little squeak of fright at the sound of the name oh molly come on it about time you got used to hearing it look i can not promise no one going to get hurt nobody can promise that but were much better off than we were last time you were not in the order then you do not understand last time we were outnumbered twenty to one by the death eater and they were picking u off one by one harry thought of the photograph again of his parent beaming face he knew moody wa still watching him do not worry about percy said sirius abruptly hell come round it a matter of time before voldemort move into the open once he doe the whole ministry going to be begging u to forgive them and i am not sure ill be accepting their apology he added bitterly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and a for who is going to look after ron and ginny if you and arthur died said lupin smiling slightly what do you think wed do let them starve mr weasley smiled tremulously being silly she muttered again mopping her eye but harry closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minute later could not think mr weasley silly he could still see his parent beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph unaware that their life like so many of those around them were drawing to a close the image of the boggart posing a the corpse of each member of mr weasleys family in turn kept flashing before his eye without warning the scar on his forehead seared with pain again and his stomach churned horribly cut it out he said firmly rubbing the scar a the pain receded again first sign of madness talking to your own head said a sly voice from the empty picture on the wall harry ignored it he felt older than he had ever felt in his life and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect badge page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling luna lovegood harry had a troubled night sleep his parent wove in and out of his dream never speaking mr weasley sobbed over kreachers dead body watched by ron and hermione who were wearing crown and yet again harry found himself walking down a corridor ending in a locked door he awoke abruptly with his scar prickling to find ron already dressed and talking to him better hurry up mum going ballistic she say were going to miss the train there wa a lot of commotion in the house from what he heard a he dressed at top speed harry gathered that fred and george had bewitched their trunk to fly downstairs to save the bother of carrying them with the result that they had hurtled straight into ginny and knocked her down two flight of stair into the hall mr black and mr weasley were both screaming at the top of their voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling could have done her a serious injury you idiot filthy halfbreeds besmirching the house of my father hermione came hurrying into the room looking flustered just a harry wa putting on his trainer hedwig wa swaying on her shoulder and she wa carrying a squirming crookshanks in her arm mum and dad just sent hedwig back the owl fluttered obligingly over and perched on top of her cage are you ready yet nearly ginny all right harry asked shoving on his glass mr weasleys patched her up said hermione but now madeyes complaining that we can not leave unless sturgis podmores here otherwise the guard will be one short guard said harry we have to go to king cross with a guard you have to go to king cross with a guard hermione corrected him why said harry irritably i thought voldemort wa supposed to be lying low or are you telling me he going to jump out from behind a dustbin to try and do me in i do not know it just what madeye say said hermione distractedly looking at her watch but if we do not leave soon were definitely going to miss the train page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling will you lot get down here now please mr weasley bellowed and hermione jumped a though scalded and hurried out of the room harry seized hedwig stuffed her unceremoniously into her cage and set off downstairs after hermione dragging his trunk mr black portrait wa howling with rage but nobody wa bothering to close the curtain over her all the noise in the hall wa bound to rouse her again anyway harry you are to come with me and tonks shouted mr weasley over the repeated screech of mudbloodsl scum creature of dirv leave your trunk and your owl alastors going to deal with the luggage oh for heaven sake sirius dumbledore said no a bearlike black dog had appeared at harrys side a harry clambered over the various trunk cluttering the hall to get to mr weasley oh honestly said mr weasley despairingly well on your own head be it she wrenched open the front door and stepped out into the weak september sunlight harry and the dog followed her the door slammed behind them and mr black screech were cut off instantly where is tonks harry said looking around a they went down the stone step of number twelve which vanished the moment they reached the pavement she is waiting for u just up here said mr weasley stiffly averting her eye from the lolloping black dog beside harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling an old woman greeted them on the corner she had tightly curled gray hair and wore a purple hat shaped like a porkpie wotcher harry she said winking better hurry up had not we molly she added checking her watch i know i know moaned mr weasley lengthening her stride but madeye wanted to wait for sturgis if only arthur could have got u car from the ministry again but fudge would not let him borrow so much a an empty ink bottle these day how muggles can stand traveling without magic but the great black dog gave a joyful bark and gamboled around them snapping at pigeon and chasing it own tail harry could not help laughing sirius had been trapped inside for a very long time mr weasley pursed her lip in an almost aunt petuniaish way it took them twenty minute to reach king cross by foot and nothing more eventful happened during that time than sirius scaring a couple of cat for harrys entertainment once inside the station they lingered casually beside the barrier between platform nine and ten until the coast wa clear then each of them leaned against it in turn and fell easily through onto platform nine and three quarter where the hogwarts express stood belching sooty steam over a platform packed with departing student and their family harry inhaled the familiar smell and felt his spirit soar he wa really going back i hope the others make it in time said mr weasley anxiously staring behind her at the wroughtiron arch spanning the platform through which new arrival would come page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling nice dog harry called a tall boy with dreadlock thanks lee said harry grinning a sirius wagged his tail frantically oh good said mr weasley sounding relieved here is ala tor with the luggage look a porter cap pulled low over his mismatched eye moody came limping through the archway pushing a cart full of their trunk all okay he muttered to mr weasley and tonks do not think we were followed second later mr weasley emerged onto the platform with ron and hermione they had almost unloaded moody luggage cart when fred george and ginny turned up with lupin no trouble growled moody nothing said lupin ill still be reporting sturgis to dumbledore said moody that is the second time he not turned up in a week getting a unreliable a mundungus well look after yourselves said lupin shaking hand all round he reached harry last and gave him a clap on the shoulder you too harry be careful yeah keep your head down and your eye peeled said moody shaking harrys hand too and do not forget all of you careful what you put in writing if in doubt do not put it in a letter at all page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it been great meeting all of you said tonks hugging hermione and ginny well see you soon i expect a warning whistle sounded the student still on the platform started hurrying onto the train quick quick said mr weasley distractedly hugging them at random and catching harry twice write be good if you have forgotten anything well send it on onto the train now hurry for one brief moment the great black dog reared onto it hind leg and placed it front paw on harrys shoulder but mr weasley shoved harry away toward the train door hissing for heaven sake act more like a dog sirius see you harry called out of the open window a the train began to move while ron hermione and ginny waved beside him the figure of tonks lupin moody and mr and mr weasley shrank rapidly but the black dog wa bounding alongside the window wagging it tail blurred people on the platform were laughing to see it chasing the train and then they turned the corner and sirius wa gone he should not have come with u said hermione in a worried voice oh lighten up said ron he ha not seen daylight for month poor bloke well said fred clapping his hand together can not stand around chatting all day we have got business to discus with lee see you later and he and george disappeared down the corridor to the right page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the train wa gathering still more speed so that the house outside the window flashed past and they swayed where they stood shall we go and find a compartment then harry asked ron and hermione ron and hermione exchanged look er said ron were well ron and i are supposed to go into the prefect carriage hermione said awkwardly ron wa not looking at harry he seemed to have become intensely interested in the fingernail on his left hand oh said harry right fine i do not think well have to stay there all journey said hermione quickly our letter said we just get instruction from the head boy and girl and then patrol the corridor from time to time fine said harry again well ii might see you later then yeah definitely said ron casting a shifty anxious look at harry it a pain having to go down there id rather but we have to i mean i am not enjoying it i am not percy he finished defiantly i know you are not said harry and he grinned but a hermione and ron dragged their trunk crookshanks and a caged pigwidgeon off toward the engine end of the train harry felt an odd sense of loss he had never traveled on the hogwarts express without ron page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling come on ginny told him if we get a move on well be able to save them place right said harry picking up hedwigs cage in one hand and the handle of his trunk in the other they struggled off down the corridor peering through the glasspaneled door into the compartment they passed which were already full harry could not help noticing that a lot of people stared back at him with great interest and that several of them nudged their neighbor and pointed him out after he had met this behavior in five consecutive carriage he remembered that the daily prophet had been telling it reader all summer what a lying showoff he wa he wondered bleakly whether the people now staring and whispering believed the story in the very last carriage they met neville longbottom harrys fellow fifthyear gryffindor his round face shining with the effort of pulling his trunk along and maintaining a onehanded grip on his struggling toad trevor hi harry he panted hi ginny everywhere s full i can not find a seat what are you talking about said ginny who had squeezed past neville to peer into the compartment behind him there is room in this one there is only loony lovegood in here neville mumbled something about not wanting to disturb anyone do not be silly said ginny laughing she is all right she slid the door open and pulled her trunk inside it harry and neville followed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hi luna said ginny is it okay if we take these seat the girl beside the window looked up she had straggly waistlength dirtyblond hair very pale eyebrow and protuberant eye that gave her a permanently surprised look harry knew at once why neville had chosen to pas this compartment by the girl gave off an aura of distinct dottiness perhaps it wa the fact that she had stuck her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping or that she had chosen to wear a necklace of butterbeer cap or that she wa reading a magazine upside down her eye ranged over neville and came to rest on harry she nodded thanks said ginny smiling at her harry and neville stowed the three trunk and hedwigs cage in the luggage rack and sat down the girl called luna watched them over her upsidedown magazine which wa called the quibbler she did not seem to need to blink a much a normal human she stared and stared at harry who had taken the seat opposite her and now wished he had not had a good summer luna ginny asked yes said luna dreamily without taking her eye off harry yes it wa quite enjoyable you know you are harry potter she added i know i am said harry neville chuckled luna turned her pale eye upon him instead and i do not know who you are i am nobody said neville hurriedly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no you are not said ginny sharply neville longbottom luna lovegood luna in my year but in ravenclaw wit beyond measure is man greatest treasure said luna in a singsong voice she raised her upsidedown magazine high enough to hide her face and fell silent harry and neville looked at each other with their eyebrow raised ginny suppressed a giggle the train rattled onward speeding them out into open country it wa an odd unsettled sort of day one moment the carriage wa full of sunlight and the next they were passing beneath ominously gray cloud guess what i got for my birthday said neville another remembrall said harry remembering the marblelike device nevilles grandmother had sent him in an effort to improve his abysmal memory no said neville i could do with one though i lost the old one age ago no look at this he dug the hand that wa not keeping a firm grip on trevor into his schoolbag and after a little bit of rummaging pulled out what appeared to be a small gray cactus in a pot except that it wa covered with what looked like boil rather than spine mimbulus mimbletonia he said proudly harry stared at the thing it wa pulsating slightly giving it the rather sinister look of some diseased internal organ page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it really really rare said neville beaming i do not know if there is one in the greenhouse at hogwarts even i can not wait to show it to professor sprout my greatuncle algie got it for me in assyria i am going to see if i can breed from it harry knew that nevilles favorite subject wa herbology but for the life of him he could not see what he would want with this stunted little plant doe it er do anything he asked load of stuff said neville proudly it got an amazing defensive mechanism hold trevor for me he dumped the toad into harrys lap and took a quill from his schoolbag luna lovegoods popping eye appeared over the top of her upsidedown magazine again watching what neville wa doing neville held the mimbulus mimbletonia up to his eye his tongue between his teeth chose his spot and gave the plant a sharp prod with the tip of his quill liquid squirted from every boil on the plant thick stinking darkgreen jet of it they hit the ceiling the window and spattered luna lovegoods magazine ginny who had flung her arm up in front of her face just in time merely looked a though she wa wearing a slimy green hat but harry whose hand had been busy preventing the escape of trevor received a face full it smelled like rancid manure neville whose face and torso were also drenched shook his head to get the worst out of his eye ssorry he gasped i have not tried that before did not realize it would be quite so do not worry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling though stinksaps not poisonous he added nervously a harry spat a mouthful onto the floor at that precise moment the door of their compartment slid open oh hello harry said a nervous voice um bad time harry wiped the lens of his glass with his trevor free hand a very pretty girl with long shiny black hair wa standing in the doorway smiling at him cho chang the seeker on the ravenclaw quidditch team oh hi said harry blankly um said cho well just thought id say hello bye then she closed the door again rather pink in the face and departed harry slumped back in his seat and groaned he would have liked cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their head off at a joke he had just told he would not have chosen to be sitting with neville and loony lovegood clutching a toad and dripping in stinksap never mind said ginny bracingly look we can get rid of all this easily she pulled out her wand scour gif yy the stinksap vanished sorry said neville again in a small voice ron and hermione did not turn up for nearly an hour by which time the food trolley had already gone by harry ginny and neville had finished their pumpkin pasty and were busy swapping chocolate page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling frog card when the compartment door slid open and they walked in accompanied by crookshanks and a shrilly hooting pigwidgeon in his cage i am starving said ron stowing pigwidgeon next to hedwig grabbing a chocolate frog from harry and throwing himself into the seat next to him he ripped open the wrapper bit off the frog head and leaned back with his eye closed a though he had had a very exhausting morning well there are two fifthyear prefect from each house said hermione looking thoroughly disgruntled a she took her seat boy and girl from each and guess who is a slytherin prefect said ron still with his eye closed malfoy replied harry at once his worst fear confirmed course said ron bitterly stuffing the rest of the frog into his mouth and taking another and that complete cow pansy parkinson said hermione viciously how she got to be a prefect when she is thicker than a concussed troll who is hufflepuff harry asked ernie macmillan and hannah abbott said ron thickly and anthony goldstein and padma patil for ravenclaw said hermione you went to the yule ball with padma patil said a vague voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling everyone turned to look at luna lovegood who wa gazing unblinkingly at ron over the top of the quibbler he swallowed his mouthful of frog yeah i know i did he said looking mildly surprised she did not enjoy it very much luna informed him she doe not think you treated her very well because you would not dance with her i do not think id have minded she added thoughtfully i do not like dancing very much she retreated behind the quibbler again ron stared at the cover with his mouth hanging open for a few second then looked around at ginny for some kind of explanation but ginny had stuffed her knuckle in her mouth to stop herself giggling ron shook his head bemused then checked his watch were supposed to patrol the corridor every so often he told harry and neville and we can give out punishment if people are misbehaving i can not wait to get crabbe and goyle for something you are not supposed to abuse your position ron said hermione sharply yeah right because malfoy will not abuse it at all said ron sarcastically so you are going to descend to his level no i am just going to make sure i get his mate before he get mine for heaven sake ron page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ill make goyle do line it will kill him he hate writing said ron happily he lowered his voice to goyle s low grunt and screwing up his face in a look of pained concentration mimed writing in midair i must not look like a baboon backside everyone laughed but nobody laughed harder than luna lovegood she let out a scream of mirth that caused hedwig to wake up and flap her wing indignantly and crookshanks to leap up into the luggage rack hissing she laughed so hard that her magazine slipped out of her grasp slid down her leg and onto the floor that wa funny her prominent eye swam with tear a she gasped for breath staring at ron utterly nonplussed he looked around at the others who were now laughing at the expression on ron face and at the ludicrously prolonged laughter of luna lovegood who wa rocking backward and forward clutching her side are you taking the mickey said ron frowning at her baboon backside she choked holding her rib everyone else wa watching luna laughing but harry glancing at the magazine on the floor noticed something that made him dive for it upside down it had been hard to tell what the picture on the front wa but harry now realized it wa a fairly bad cartoon of cornelius fudge harry only recognized him because of the limegreen bowler hat one of fudge hand wa clenched around a bag of gold the other hand wa throttling a goblin the cartoon wa captioned how far will fudge go to gain gringotts page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling beneath this were listed the title of other article inside the magazine corruption in the quidditch league how the tornado are taking control secret of the ancient rune revealed sirius black villain or victim can i have a look at this harry asked luna eagerly she nodded still gazing at ron breathless with laughter harry opened the magazine and scanned the index until this moment he had completely forgotten the magazine kingsley had handed mr weasley to give to sirius but it must have been this edition of the quibbler he found the page and turned excitedly to the article this too wa illustrated by a rather bad cartoon in fact harry would not have known it wa supposed to be sirius if it had not been captioned sirius wa standing on a pile of human bone with his wand out the headline on the article read sirius black a he painted notorious mass murderer or innocent singing sensation harry had to read this sentence several time before he wa convinced that he had not misunderstood it since when had sirius been a singing sensation page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling for fourteen year sirius black ha been believed guilty of the mass murder of twelve innocent muggles and one wizard black audacious escape from azkaban two year ago ha led to the widest manhunt ever conducted by the ministry of magic none of u ha ever questioned that he deserves to be recaptured and handed back to the dementors but doe he startling new evidence ha recently come to light that sirius black may not have committed the crime for which he wa sent to azkaban in fact say doris purkiss of acanthia way little norton black may not even have been present at the killing what people do not realize is that sirius black is a false name say mr purkiss the man people believe to be sirius black is actually stubby boardman lead singer of the popular singing group the hobgoblin who retired from public life after being struck in the ear by a turnip at a concert in little norton church hall nearly fifteen year ago i recognized him the moment i saw his picture in the paper now stubby could not possibly have committed those crime because on the day in question he happened to be enjoying a romantic candlelit dinner with me i have written to the minister of magic and am expecting him to give stubby alias sirius a full pardon any day now harry finished reading and stared at the page in disbelief perhaps it wa a joke he thought perhaps the magazine often printed spoof item he flicked back a few page and found the piece on fudge cornelius fudge the minister of magic denied that he had any plan to take over the running of the wizarding bank gringotts when he wa elected page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling minister of magic five year ago fudge ha always insisted that he want nothing more than to cooperate peacefully with the guardian of our gold but doe he source close to the minister have recently disclosed that fudge dearest ambition is to seize control of the goblin gold supply and that he will not hesitate to use force if need be it would not be the first time either said a ministry insider cornelius goblincrusher fudge that is what his friend call him if you could hear him when he think no one listening oh he always talking about the goblin he had done in he had them drowned he had them dropped off building he had them poisoned he had them cooked in pie harry did not read any further fudge might have many fault but harry found it extremely hard to imagine him ordering goblin to be cooked in pie he flicked through the rest of the magazine pausing every few page he read an accusation that the tutshill tornado were winning the quidditch league by a combination of blackmail illegal broom tampering and torture an interview with a wizard who claimed to have flown to the moon on a cleansweep six and brought back a bag of moon frog to prove it and an article on ancient rune which at least explained why luna had been reading the quibbler upside down according to the magazine if you turned the rune on their head they revealed a spell to make your enemy ear turn into kumquat in fact compared to the rest of the article in the quibbler the suggestion that sirius might really be the lead singer of the hobgoblin wa quite sensible page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling anything good in there asked ron a harry closed the magazine of course not said hermione scathingly before harry could answer the quibbler rubbish everyone know that excuse me said luna her voice had suddenly lost it dreamy quality my father the editor i oh said hermione looking embarrassed well it got some interesting i mean it quite ill have it back thank you said luna coldly and leaning forward she snatched it out of harrys hand rifling through it to page fiftyseven she turned it resolutely upside down again and disappeared behind it just a the compartment door opened for the third time harry looked around he had expected this but that did not make the sight of draco malfoy smirking at him from between his crony crabbe and goyle any more enjoyable what he said aggressively before malfoy could open his mouth manner potter or ill have to give you a detention drawled malfoy whose sleek blond hair and pointed chin were just like his father you see i unlike you have been made a prefect which mean that i unlike you have the power to hand out punishment yeah said harry but you unlike me are a git so get out and leave u alone ron hermione ginny and neville laughed malfoys lip curled page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tell me how doe it feel being secondbest to weasley potter he asked shut up malfoy said hermione sharply i seem to have touched a nerve said malfoy smirking well just watch yourself potter because ill be dogging your footstep in case you step out of line get out said hermione standing up sniggering malfoy gave harry a last malicious look and departed crabbe and goyle lumbering in his wake hermione slammed the compartment door behind them and turned to look at harry who knew at once that she like him had registered what malfoy had said and been just a unnerved by it chuck u another frog said ron who had clearly noticed nothing harry could not talk freely in front of neville and luna he exchanged another nervous look with hermione and then stared out of the window he had thought sirius coming with him to the station wa a bit of a laugh but suddenly it seemed reckless if not downright dangerous hermione had been right sirius should not have come what if mr malfoy had noticed the black dog and told draco what if he had deduced that the weasleys lupin tonks and moody knew where sirius wa hiding or had malfoys use of the word dogging been a coincidence the weather remained undecided a they traveled farther and farther north rain spattered the window in a halfhearted way then the sun put in a feeble page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling appearance before cloud drifted over it once more when darkness fell and lamp came on inside the carriage luna rolled up the quibbler put it carefully away in her bag and took to staring at everyone in the compartment instead harry wa sitting with his forehead pressed against the train window trying to get a first distant glimpse of hogwarts but it wa a moonless night and the rainstreaked window wa grimy wed better change said hermione at last she and ron pinned their prefect badge carefully to their chest harry saw ron checking how it looked in the black window at last the train began to slow down and they heard the usual racket up and down it a everybody scrambled to get their luggage and pet assembled ready for departure ron and hermione were supposed to supervise all this they disappeared from the carriage again leaving harry and the others to look after crookshanks and pigwidgeon ill carry that owl if you like said luna to harry reaching out for pigwidgeon a neville stowed trevor carefully in an inside pocket oh er thanks said harry handing her the cage and hoisting hedwigs more securely into his arm they shuffled out of the compartment feeling the first sting of the night air on their face a they joined the crowd in the corridor slowly they moved toward the door harry could smell the pine tree that lined the path down to the lake he stepped down onto the platform and looked around listening for the familiar call of fir year over here fir year page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but it did not come instead a quite different voice a brisk female one wa calling first year line up over here please all first year to me a lantern came swinging toward harry and by it light he saw the prominent chin and severe haircut of professor grubblyplank the witch who had taken over hagrid s care of magical creature lesson for a while the previous year where is hagrid he said out loud i do not know said ginny but wed better get out of the way were blocking the door oh yeah harry and ginny became separated a they moved off along the platform and out through the station jostled by the crowd harry squinted through the darkness for a glimpse of hagrid he had to be here harry had been relying on it seeing hagrid again had been one of the thing to which he had been looking forward most but there wa no sign of him at all he can not have left harry told himself a he shuffled slowly through a narrow doorway onto the road outside with the rest of the crowd he just got a cold or something he looked around for ron or hermione wanting to know what they thought about the reappearance of professor grubblyplank but neither of them wa anywhere near him so he allowed himself to be shunted forward onto the dark rainwashed road outside hogsmeade station page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling here stood the hundred or so horseless stagecoach that always took the student above first year up to the castle harry glanced quickly at them turned away to keep a lookout for ron and hermione then did a double take the coach were no longer horseless there were creature standing between the carriage shaft if he had had to give them a name he supposed he would have called them horse though there wa something reptilian about them too they were completely fleshless their black coat clinging to their skeleton of which every bone wa visible their head were dragonish and their pupilless eye white and staring wing sprouted from each wither vast black leathery wing that looked a though they ought to belong to giant bat standing still and quiet in the gloom the creature looked eerie and sinister harry could not understand why the coach were being pulled by these horrible horse when they were quite capable of moving along by themselves where is pig said ron voice right behind harry that luna girl wa carrying him said harry turning quickly eager to consult ron about hagrid where dyou reckon hagrid is i do not know said ron sounding worried he would better be okay a short distance away draco malfoy followed by a small gang of crony including crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson wa pushing some timidlooking second year out of the way so that they could get a coach to themselves second later hermione emerged panting from the crowd page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling malfoy wa being absolutely foul to a first year back there i swear i am going to report him he only had his badge three minute and he using it to bully people worse than ever where is crookshanks ginnys got him said harry there she is ginny had just emerged from the crowd clutching a squirming crookshanks thanks said hermione relieving ginny of the cat come on let u get a carriage together before they all fillup i have not got pig yet ron said but hermione wa already heading off toward the nearest unoccupied coach harry remained behind with ron what are those thing dyou reckon he asked ron nodding at the horrible horse a the other student surged past them what thing those horse luna appeared holding pigwidgeons cage in her arm the tiny owl wa twittering excitedly a usual here you are she said he a sweet little owl is not he er yeah he all right said ron gruffly well come on then let u get in what were you saying harry i wa saying what are those horse thing harry said a he ron and luna made for the carriage in which hermione and ginny were already sitting page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what horse thing the horse thing pulling the carriage said harry impatiently they were after all about three foot from the nearest one it wa watching them with empty white eye ron however gave harry a perplexed look what are you talking about i am talking about look harry grabbed ron arm and wheeled him about so that he wa facetoface with the winged horse ron stared straight at it for a second then looked back at harry what am i supposed to be looking at at the there between the shaft harnessed to the coach it right there in front but a ron continued to look bemused a strange thought occurred to harry can not can not you see them see what can not you see what is pulling the carriage ron looked seriously alarmed now are you feeling all right harry i yeah harry felt utterly bewildered the horse wa there in front of him gleaming solidly in the dim light issuing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling from the station window behind them vapor rising from it nostril in the chilly night air yet unless ron wa faking and it wa a very feeble joke if he wa ron could not see it at all shall we get in then said ron uncertainly looking at harry a though worried about him yeah said harry yeah go on it all right said a dreamy voice from beside harry a ron vanished into the coach dark interior you are not going mad or anything i can see them too can you said harry desperately turning to luna he could see the batwinged horse reflected in her wide silvery eye oh yes said luna i have been able to see them ever since my first day here they have always pulled the carriage do not worry you are just a sane a i am smiling faintly she climbed into the musty interior of the carriage after ron not altogether reassured harry followed her page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling xx the sorting hat new song harry did not want to tell the others that he and luna were having the same hallucination if that wa what it wa so he said nothing about the horse a he sat down inside the carriage and slammed the door behind him nevertheless he could not help watching the silhouette of the horse moving beyond the window did everyone see that grubblyplank woman asked ginny what is she doing back here hagrid can not have left can he ill be quite glad if he ha said luna he is not a very good teacher is he yes he is said harry ron and ginny angrily harry glared at hermione she cleared her throat and quickly said erm yes he very good well we think he a bit of a joke in ravenclaw said luna unfazed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you have got a rubbish sense of humor then ron snapped a the wheel below them creaked into motion luna did not seem perturbed by ron rudeness on the contrary she simply watched him for a while a though he were a mildly interesting television program rattling and swaying the carriage moved in convoy up the road when they passed between the tall stone pillar topped with winged boar on either side of the gate to the school ground harry leaned forward to try and see whether there were any light on in hagrids cabin by the forbidden forest but the ground were in complete darkness hogwarts castle however loomed ever closer a towering mass of turret jetblack against the dark sky here and there a window blazing fiery bright above them the carriage jingled to a halt near the stone step leading up to the oak front door and harry got out of the carriage first he turned again to look for lit window down by the forest but there wa definitely no sign of life within hagrids cabin unwillingly because he had half hoped they would have vanished he turned his eye instead upon the strange skeletal creature standing quietly in the chill night air their blank white eye gleaming harry had once before had the experience of seeing something that ron could not but that had been a reflection in a mirror something much more insubstantial than a hundred very solidlooking beast strong enough to pull a fleet of carriage if luna wa to be believed the beast had always been there but invisible why then could harry suddenly see them and why could ron not page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling are you coming or what said ron beside him oh yeah said harry quickly and they joined the crowd hurrying up the stone step into the castle the entrance hall wa ablaze with torch and echoing with footstep a the student crossed the flagged stone floor for the double door to the right leading to the great hall and the startofterm feast the four long house table in the great hall were filling up under the starless black ceiling which wa just like the sky they could glimpse through the high window candle floated in midair all along the table illuminating the silvery ghost who were dotted about the hall and the face of the student talking eagerly to one another exchanging summer news shouting greeting at friend from other house eyeing one anothers new haircut and robe again harry noticed people putting their head together to whisper a he passed he gritted his teeth and tried to act a though he neither noticed nor cared luna drifted away from them at the ravenclaw table the moment they reached gryffindors ginny wa hailed by some fellow fourth year and left to sit with them harry ron hermione and neville found seat together about halfway down the table between nearly headless nick the gryffindor house ghost and parvati patil and lavender brown the last two of whom gave harry airy overly friendly greeting that made him quite sure they had stopped talking about him a split second before he had more important thing to worry about however he wa looking over the student head to the staff table that ran along the top wall of the hall he not there page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ron and hermione scanned the staff table too though there wa no real need hagrids size made him instantly obvious in any lineup he can not have left said ron sounding slightly anxious of course he ha not said harry firmly you do not think he hurt or anything do you said hermione uneasily no said harry at once but where is he then there wa a pause then harry said very quietly so that neville parvati and lavender could not hear maybe he not back yet you know from his mission the thing he wa doing over the summer for dumbledore yeah yeah that will be it said ron sounding reassured but hermione bit her lip looking up and down the staff table a though hoping for some conclusive explanation of hagrids absence who is that she said sharply pointing toward the middle of the staff table harrys eye followed hers they lit first upon professor dumbledore sitting in his highbacked golden chair at the center of the long staff table wearing deeppurple robe scattered with silvery star and a matching hat dumbledores head wa inclined toward the woman sitting next to him who wa talking into his ear she looked harry thought like somebody is maiden aunt squat with short curly mousebrown hair in which she had placed a horrible page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling pink alice band that matched the fluffy pink cardigan she wore over her robe then she turned her face slightly to take a sip from her goblet and he saw with a shock of recognition a pallid toadlike face and a pair of prominent pouchy eye it that umbridge woman who said hermione she wa at my hearing she work for fudge nice cardigan said ron smirking she work for fudge hermione repeated frowning what on earth she doing here then do not know hermione scanned the staff table her eye narrowed no she muttered no surely not harry did not understand what she wa talking about but did not ask his attention had just been caught by professor grubblyplank who had just appeared behind the staff table she worked her way along to the very end and took the seat that ought to have been hagrids that meant that the first year must have crossed the lake and reached the castle and sure enough a few second later the door from the entrance hall opened a long line of scaredlooking first year entered led by professor mcgonagall who wa carrying a stool on which sat an ancient wizard hat heavily patched and darned with a wide rip near the frayed brim the buzz of talk in the great hall faded away the first year lined up in front of the staff table facing the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling rest of the student and professor mcgonagall placed the stool carefully in front of them then stood back the first year face glowed palely in the candlelight a small boy right in the middle of the row looked a though he wa trembling harry recalled fleetingly how terrified he had felt when he had stood there waiting for the unknown test that would determine to which house he belonged the whole school waited with bated breath then the rip near the hat brim opened wide like a mouth and the sorting hat burst into song in time of old when i wa new and hogwarts barely started the founder of our noble school thought never to be parted united by a common goal they had the selfsame yearning to make the world best magic school and pas along their learning together we will build and teach the four good friend decided and never did they dream that they might someday be divided for were there such friend anywhere a slytherin and gryffndor unless it wa the second pair of huffepuff and ravenclaw so how could it have gone so wrong how could such friendship fail why i wa there and so can tell the whole sad sorry tale said slytherin well teach just those whose ancestry is purest said ravenclaw well teach those whose intelligence is surest said gryffindor well teach all those page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling with brave deed to their name said hufflepuff teach the lot and treat them just the same these difference caused little strife when first they came to light for each of the four founder had a house in which they might take only those they wanted so for instance slytherin took only pureblood wizard of great cunning just like him and only those of sharpest mind were taught by ravenclaw while the bravest and the boldest went to daring gryffindor good hufflepuff she took the rest and taught them all she knew thus the house and their founder retained friendship firm and true so hogwarts worked in harmony for several happy year but then discord crept among u feeding on our fault and fear the house that like pillar four had once held up our school now turned upon each other and divided sought to rule and for a while it seemed the school must meet an early end what with dueling and with fighting and the clash of friend on friend and at last there came a morning when old slytherin departed and though the fighting then died out he left u quite downhearted and never since the founder four were whittled down to three have the house been united a they once were meant to be page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and now the sorting hat is here and you all know the score i sort you into house because that is what i am for but this year ill go further listen closely to my song though condemned i am to split you still i worry that it wrong though i must fulfill my duty and must quarter every year still i wonder whether sorting may not bring the end i fear oh know the peril read the sign the warning history show for our hogwarts is in danger from external deadly foe and we must unite inside her or well crumble from within i have told you i have warned you let the sorting now begin the hat became motionless once more applause broke out though it wa punctured for the first time in harrys memory with muttering and whisper all across the great hall student were exchanging remark with their neighbor and harry clapping along with everyone else knew exactly what they were talking about branched out a bit this year ha not it said ron his eyebrow raised too right it ha said harry the sorting hat usually confined itself to describing the different quality looked for by each of the four hogwarts house and it own role in sorting them harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i wonder if it ever given warning before said hermione sounding slightly anxious yes indeed said nearly headless nick knowledgeably leaning across neville toward her neville winced it wa very uncomfortable to have a ghost lean through you the hat feel itself honor bound to give the school due warning whenever it feel but professor mcgonagall who wa waiting to read out the list of first year name wa giving the whispering student the sort of look that scorch nearly headless nick placed a seethrough finger to his lip and sat primly upright again a the muttering came to an abrupt end with a last frowning look that swept the four house table professor mcgonagall lowered her eye to her long piece of parchment and called out abercrombie euan the terrifiedlooking boy harry had noticed earlier stumbled forward and put the hat on his head it wa only prevented from falling right down to his shoulder by his very prominent ear the hat considered for a moment then the rip near the brim opened again and shouted gr yffind or harry clapped loudly with the rest of gryffindor house a euan abercrombie staggered to their table and sat down looking a though he would like very much to sink through the floor and never be looked at again slowly the long line of first year thinned in the pause between the name and the sorting hat decision harry could hear ron stomach rumbling loudly finally zeller rose wa sorted into page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hufflepuff and professor mcgonagall picked up the hat and stool and marched them away a professor dumbledore rose to his foot harry wa somehow soothed to see dumbledore standing before them all whatever his recent bitter feeling toward his headmaster between the absence of hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horse he had felt that his return to hogwarts so long anticipated wa full of unexpected surprise like jarring note in a familiar song but this at least wa how it wa supposed to be their headmaster rising to greet them all before the startofterm feast to our newcomer said dumbledore in a ringing voice his arm stretched wide and a beaming smile on his lip welcome to our old hand welcome back there is a time for speech making but this is not it tuck in there wa an appreciative laugh and an outbreak of applause a dumbledore sat down neatly and threw his long beard over his shoulder so a to keep it out of the way of his plate for food had appeared out of nowhere so that the five long table were groaning under joint and pie and dish of vegetable bread sauce and flagon of pumpkin juice excellent said ron with a kind of groan of longing and he seized the nearest plate of chop and began piling them onto his plate watched wistfully by nearly headless nick what were you saying before the sorting hermione asked the ghost about the hat giving warning oh yes said nick who seemed glad of a reason to turn away from ron who wa now eating roast potato with almost indecent enthusiasm yes i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling have heard the hat give several warning before always at time when it detects period of great danger for the school and always of course it advice is the same stand together be strong from within ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat said ron his mouth wa so full harry thought it wa quite an achievement for him to make any noise at all i beg your pardon said nearly headless nick politely while hermione looked revolted ron gave an enormous swallow and said how can it know if the school in danger if it a hat i have no idea said nearly headless nick of course it life in dumbledores office so i daresay it pick thing up there and it want all the house to be friend said harry looking over at the slytherin table where draco malfoy wa holding court fat chance well now you should not take that attitude said nick reprovingly peaceful cooperation that is the key we ghost though we belong to separate house maintain link of friendship in spite of the competitiveness between gryffindor and slytherin i would never dream of seeking an argument with the bloody baron only because you are terrified of him said ron nearly headless nick looked highly affronted terrified i hope i sir nicholas de mimsy porpington have never been guilty of cowardice in my life the noble blood that run in my vein page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what blood asked ron surely you have not still got it a figure of speech said nearly headless nick now so annoyed his head wa trembling ominously on his partially severed neck i assume i am still allowed to enjoy the use of whichever word i like even if the pleasure of eating and drinking are denied me but i am quite used to student poking fun at my death i assure you nick he wa not really laughing at you said hermione throwing a furious look at ron unfortunately ron mouth wa packed to exploding point again and all he could manage wa node iddum eentup sechew which nick did not seem to think constituted an adequate apology rising into the air he straightened his feathered hat and swept away from them to the other end of the table coming to rest between the creevey brother colin and dennis well done ron snapped hermione what said ron indignantly having managed finally to swallow his food i am not allowed to ask a simple question oh forget it said hermione irritably and the pair of them spent the rest of the meal in huffy silence harry wa too used to their bickering to bother trying to reconcile them he felt it wa a better use of his time to eat his way steadily through his steakand kidney pie then a large plateful of his favorite treacle tart page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling when all the student had finished eating and the noise level in the hall wa starting to creep upward again dumbledore got to his foot once more talking ceased immediately a all turned to face the headmaster harry wa feeling pleasantly drowsy now his fourposter bed wa waiting somewhere above wonderfully warm and soft well now that we are all digesting another magnificent feast i beg a few moment of your attention for the usual startofterm notice said dumbledore first year ought to know that the forest in the ground is out of bound to student and a few of our older student ought to know by now too harry ron and hermione exchanged smirk mr filch the caretaker ha asked me for what he tell me is the four hundred and sixtysecond time to remind you all that magic is not permitted in corridor between class nor are a number of other thing all of which can be checked on the extensive list now fastened to mr filchs office door we have had two change in staffing this year we are very pleased to welcome back professor grubbly plank who will be taking care of magical creature lesson we are also delighted to introduce professor umbridge our new defense against the dark art teacher there wa a round of polite but fairly unenthusiastic applause during which harry ron and hermione exchanged slightly panicked look dumbledore had not said for how long grubblyplank would be teaching dumbledore continued tryout for the house quidditch team will take place on the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he broke off looking inquiringly at professor umbridge a she wa not much taller standing than sitting there wa a moment when nobody understood why dumbledore had stopped talking but then professor umbridge said hem hem and it became clear that she had got to her foot and wa intending to make a speech dumbledore only looked taken aback for a moment then he sat back down smartly and looked alertly at professor umbridge a though he desired nothing better than to listen to her talk other member of staff were not a adept at hiding their surprise professor sprout eyebrow had disappeared into her flyaway hair and professor mcgonagalls mouth wa a thin a harry had ever seen it no new teacher had ever interrupted dumbledore before many of the student were smirking this woman obviously did not know how thing were done at hogwarts thank you headmaster professor umbridge simpered for those kind word of welcome her voice wa highpitched breathy and littlegirlish and again harry felt a powerful rush of dislike that he could not explain to himself all he knew wa that he loathed everything about her from her stupid voice to her fluffy pink cardigan she gave another little throatclearing cough hem hem and continued well it is lovely to be back at hogwarts i must say she smiled revealing very pointed teeth and to see such happy little face looking back at me harry glanced around none of the face he could see looked happy on the contrary they all looked rather taken aback at being addressed a though they were five year old page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and i am sure well be very good friend student exchanged look at this some of them were barely concealing grin ill be her friend a long a i do not have to borrow that cardigan parvati whispered to lavender and both of them lapsed into silent giggle professor umbridge cleared her throat again hem hem but when she continued some of the breathiness had vanished from her voice she sounded much more businesslike and now her word had a dull learnedbyheart sound to them the ministry of magic ha always considered the education of young witch and wizard to be of vital importance the rare gift with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction the ancient skill unique to the wizarding community must be passed down through the generation lest we lose them forever the treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestor must be guarded replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching professor umbridge paused here and made a little bow to her fellow staff member none of whom bowed back professor mcgonagalls dark eyebrow had contracted so that she looked positively hawklike and harry distinctly saw her exchange a significant glance with professor sprout a umbridge gave another little hem hem and went on with her speech every headmaster and headmistress of hogwarts ha brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school and that is a it should page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling be for without progress there will be stagnation and decay there again progress for progress sake must be discouraged for our tried and tested tradition often require no tinkering a balance then between old and new between permanence and change between tradition and innovation harry found his attentiveness ebbing a though his brain wa slipping in and out of tune the quiet that always filled the hall when dumbledore wa speaking wa breaking up a student put their head together whispering and giggling over at the ravenclaw table cho chang wa chatting animatedly with her friend a few seat along from cho luna lovegood had got out the quibbler again meanwhile at the hufflepuff table ernie macmillan wa one of the few still staring at professor umbridge but he wa glassyeyed and harry wa sure he wa only pretending to listen in an attempt to live up to the new prefect badge gleaming on his chest professor umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience harry had the impression that a fullscale riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her speech the teacher however were still listening very attentively and hermione seemed to be drinking in every word umbridge spoke though judging by her expression they were not at all to her taste because some change will be for the better while others will come in the fullness of time to be recognized a error of judgment meanwhile some old habit will be retained and rightly so whereas others outmoded and outworn must be abandoned let u move forward then into a new era of openness effectiveness and accountability intent on preserving what ought to be preserved perfecting page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what need to be perfected and pruning wherever we find practice that ought to be prohibited she sat down dumbledore clapped the staff followed his lead though harry noticed that several of them brought their hand together only once or twice before stopping a few student joined in but most had been taken unawares by the end of the speech not having listened to more than a few word of it and before they could start applauding properly dumbledore had stood up again thank you very much professor umbridge that wa most illuminating he said bowing to her now a i wa saying quidditch tryout will be held yes it certainly wa illuminating said hermione in a low voice you are not telling me you enjoyed it ron said quietly turning a glazed face upon hermione that wa about the dullest speech i have ever heard and i grew up with percy i said illuminating not enjoyable said hermione it explained a lot did it said harry in surprise sounded like a load of waffle to me there wa some important stuff hidden in the waffle said hermione grimly wa there said ron blankly how about progress for progress sake must be discouraged how about pruning wherever we find practice that ought to be prohibited page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well what doe that mean said ron impatiently ill tell you what it mean said hermione ominously it mean the ministry interfering at hogwarts there wa a great clattering and banging all around them dumbledore had obviously just dismissed the school because everyone wa standing up ready to leave the hall hermione jumped up looking flustered ron were supposed to show the first year where to go oh yeah said ron who had obviously forgotten hey hey you lot midget ron well they are they are titchy i know but you can not call them midget first year hermione called commandingly along the table this way please a group of new student walked shyly up the gap between the gryffindor and hufflepuff table all of them trying hard not to lead the group they did indeed seem very small harry wa sure he had not appeared that young when he had arrived here he grinned at them a blond boy next to euan abercrombie looked petrified nudged euan and whispered something in his ear euan abercrombie looked equally frightened and stole a horrified look at harry who felt the grin slide off his face like stinksap see you later he said to ron and hermione and he made his way out of the great hall alone doing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling everything he could to ignore more whispering staring and pointing a he passed he kept his eye fixed ahead a he wove his way through the crowd in the entrance hall then he hurried up the marble staircase took a couple of concealed shortcut and had soon left most of the crowd behind he had been stupid not to expect this he thought angrily a he walked through much emptier upstairs corridor of course everyone wa staring at him he had emerged from the triwizard maze two month ago clutching the dead body of a fellow student and claiming to have seen lord voldemort return to power there had not been time last term to explain himself before everyone went home even if he had felt up to giving the whole school a detailed account of the terrible event in that graveyard he had reached the end of the corridor to the gryffindor common room and had come to a halt in front of the portrait of the fat lady before he realized that he did not know the new password er he said glumly staring up at the fat lady who smoothed the fold of her pink satin dress and looked sternly back at him no password no entrance she said loftily harry i know it someone panted from behind him and he turned to see neville jogging toward him guess what it is i am actually going to be able to remember it for once he waved the stunted little cactus he had shown them on the train mimbulus mimbletonio correct said the fat lady and her portrait swung open toward them like a door revealing a circular page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hole in the wall behind through which harry and neville now climbed the gryffindor common room looked a welcoming a ever a cozy circular tower room full of dilapidated squashy armchair and rickety old table a fire wa crackling merrily in the grate and a few people were warming their hand before going up to their dormitory on the other side of the room fred and george weasley were pinning something up on the notice board harry waved good night to them and headed straight for the door to the boy dormitory he wa not in much of a mood for talking at the moment neville followed him dean thomas and seamus finnigan had reached the dormitory first and were in the process of covering the wall beside their bed with poster and photograph they had been talking a harry pushed open the door but stopped abruptly the moment they saw him harry wondered whether they had been talking about him then whether he wa being paranoid hi he said moving across to his own trunk and opening it hey harry said dean who wa putting on a pair of pajama in the west ham color good holiday not bad muttered harry a a true account of his holiday would have taken most of the night to relate and he could not face it you yeah it wa okay chuckled dean better than seamuss anyway he wa just telling me why what happened seamus neville asked a he placed his mimbulus mimbletonia tenderly on his bedside cabinet page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling seamus did not answer immediately he wa making rather a meal of ensuring that his poster of the kenmare kestrel quidditch team wa quite straight then he said with his back still turned to harry me mam did not want me to come back what said harry pausing in the act of pulling off his robe she did not want me to come back to hogwarts seamus turned away from his poster and pulled his own pajama out of his trunk still not looking at harry but why said harry astonished he knew that seamuss mother wa a witch and could not understand therefore why she should have come over so dursleyish seamus did not answer until he had finished buttoning his pajama well he said in a measured voice i suppose because of you what dyou mean said harry quickly his heart wa beating rather fast he felt vaguely a though something wa closing in on him well said seamus again still avoiding harrys eye she er well it not just you it dumbledore too she belief the daily prophet said harry she think i am a liar and dumbledore s an old fool seamus looked up at him yeah something like that page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry said nothing he threw his wand down onto his bedside table pulled off his robe stuffed them angrily into his trunk and pulled on his pajama he wa sick of it sick of being the person who wa stared at and talked about all the time if any of them knew if any of them had the faintest idea what it felt like to be the one all these thing had happened to mr finnigan had no idea the stupid woman he thought savagely he got into bed and made to pull the hanging closed around him but before he could do so seamus said look what did happen that night when you know when with cedric diggory and all seamus sounded nervous and eager at the same time dean who had been bending over his trunk trying to retrieve a slipper went oddly still and harry knew he wa listening hard what are you asking me for harry retorted just read the daily prophet like your mother why do not you that will tell you all you need to know do not you have a go at my mother snapped seamus ill have a go at anyone who call me a liar said harry do not talk to me like that ill talk to you how i want said harry his temper rising so fast he snatched his wand back from his bedside table if you have got a problem sharing a dormitory with me go and ask mcgonagall if you can be moved stop your mummy worrying leave my mother out of this potter page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what is going on ron had appeared in the doorway his wide eye traveled from harry who wa kneeling on his bed with his wand pointing at seamus to seamus who wa standing there with his fist raised he having a go at my mother seamus yelled what said ron harry would not do that we met your mother we liked her that is before she started believing every word the stinking daily prophet writes about me said harry at the top of his voice oh said ron comprehension dawning across his freckled face oh right you know what said seamus heatedly casting harry a venomous look he right i do not want to share a dormitory with him anymore he a madman that is out of order seamus said ron whose ear were starting to glow red always a danger sign out of order am i shouted seamus who in contrast with ron wa turning paler you believe all the rubbish he come out with about youknowwho do you you reckon he telling the truth yeah i do said ron angrily then you are mad too said seamus in disgust yeah well unfortunately for you pal i am also a prefect said ron jabbing himself in the chest with a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling finger so unless you want detention watch your mouth seamus looked for a few second a though detention would be a reasonable price to pay to say what wa going through his mind but with a noise of contempt he turned on his heel vaulted into bed and pulled the hanging shut with such violence that they were ripped from the bed and fell in a dusty pile to the floor ron glared at seamus then looked at dean and neville anyone el parent got a problem with harry he said aggressively my parent are muggles mate said dean shrugging they do not know nothing about no death at hogwarts because i am not stupid enough to tell them you do not know my mother she will weasel anything out of anyone seamus snapped at him anyway your parent do not get the daily prophet they do not know our headmaster been sacked from the wizengamot and the international confederation of wizard because he losing his marble my gran say that is rubbish piped up neville she say it the daily prophet that is going downhill not dumbledore she is canceled our subscription we believe harry he said simply he climbed into bed and pulled the cover up to his chin looking owlishly over them at seamus my gran always said you knowwho would come back one day she say if dumbledore say he back he back harry felt a rush of gratitude toward neville nobody else said anything seamus got out his wand repaired the bed hanging and vanished behind them dean page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling got into bed rolled over and fell silent neville who appeared to have nothing more to say either wa gazing fondly at his moonlit cactus harry lay back on his pillow while ron bustled around the next bed putting his thing away he felt shaken by the argument with seamus whom he had always liked very much how many more people were going to suggest that he wa lying or unhinged had dumbledore suffered like this all summer a first the wizengamot then the international confederation of wizard had thrown him from their rank wa it anger at harry perhaps that had stopped dumbledore getting in touch with him for month the two of them were in this together after all dumbledore had believed harry announced his version of event to the whole school and then to the wider wizarding community anyone who thought harry wa a liar had to think that dumbledore wa too or else that dumbledore had been hoodwinked they will know were right in the end thought harry miserably a ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory but he wondered how many attack like seamuss he would have to endure before that time came page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor umbridge seamus dressed at top speed next morning and left the dormitory before harry had even put on his sock doe he think hell turn into a nutter if he stay in a room with me too long asked harry loudly a the hem of seamuss robe whipped out of sight do not worry about it harry dean muttered hoisting his schoolbag onto his shoulder he just but apparently he wa unable to say exactly what seamus wa and after a slightly awkward pause followed him out of the room neville and ron both gave harry itshisproblemnot yours look but harry wa not much consoled how much more of this wa he going to have to take what is the matter asked hermione five minute later catching up with harry and ron halfway across the common room a they all headed toward page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling breakfast you look absolutely oh for heaven sake she wa staring at the common room notice board where a large new sign had been put up gallon of galleon pocket money failing to keep pace with your outgoings like to earn a little extra gold contact fred and george weasley gryffindor common room for simple parttime virtually painless job we regret that all work is undertaken at applicant own risk they are the limit said hermione grimly taking down the sign which fred and george had pinned up over a poster giving the date of the first hogsmeade weekend in october well have to talk to them ron ron looked positively alarmed why because were prefect said hermione a they climbed out through the portrait hole it up to u to stop this kind of thing ron said nothing harry could tell from his glum expression that the prospect of stopping fred and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling george doing exactly what they liked wa not one that he found inviting anyway what is up harry hermione continued a they walked down a flight of stair lined with portrait of old witch and wizard all of whom ignored them being engrossed in their own conversation you look really angry about something seamus reckons harrys lying about youknow who said ron succinctly when harry did not respond hermione whom harry had expected to react angrily on his behalf sighed yes lavender think so too she said gloomily been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not i am a lying attentionseeking prat have you harry said loudly no said hermione calmly i told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you actually and it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down ron and my throat harry because if you have not noticed were on your side there wa a short pause sorry said harry in a low voice that is quite all right said hermione with dignity then she shook her head do not you remember what dumbledore said at the endofterm feast last year harry and ron both looked at her blankly and hermione sighed again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling about youknowwho he said his gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great we can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust how do you remember stuff like that asked ron looking at her in admiration i listen ron said hermione with a touch of asperity so do i but i still could not tell you exactly what the point hermione pressed on loudly is that this sort of thing is exactly what dumbledore wa talking about youknow who is only been back two month and we have started fighting among ourselves and the sorting hat warning wa the same stand together be united and harry said it last night retorted ron if that mean were supposed to get matey with the slytherins fat chance well i think it a pity were not trying for a bit of interhouse unity said hermione crossly they had reached the foot of the marble staircase a line of fourthyear ravenclaws wa crossing the entrance hall they caught sight of harry and hurried to form a tighter group a though frightened he might attack straggler yeah we really ought to be trying to make friend with people like that said harry sarcastically they followed the ravenclaws into the great hall looking instinctively at the staff table a they entered professor grubblyplank wa chatting to professor page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sinistra the astronomy teacher and hagrid wa once again conspicuous only by his absence the enchanted ceiling above them echoed harrys mood it wa a miserable raincloud gray dumbledore did not even mention how long that grubblyplank woman staying he said a they made their way across to the gryffindor table maybe said hermione thoughtfully what said both harry and ron together well maybe he did not want to draw attention to hagrid not being here what dyou mean draw attention to it said ron half laughing how could we not notice before hermione could answer a tall black girl with long braided hair had marched up to harry hi angelina hi she said briskly good summer and without waiting for an answer listen i have been made gryffindor quidditch captain nice one said harry grinning at her he suspected angelinas pep talk might not be a longwinded a oliver wood had been which could only be an improvement yeah well we need a new keeper now oliver left tryout are on friday at five of the clock and i want the whole team there all right then we can see how the new personll fit in page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling okay said harry and she smiled at him and departed id forgotten wood had left said hermione vaguely sitting down beside ron and pulling a plate of toast toward her i suppose that will make quite a difference to the team i spose said harry taking the bench opposite he wa a good keeper still it will not hurt to have some new blood will it said ron with a whoosh and a clatter hundred of owl came soaring in through the upper window they descended all over the hall bringing letter and package to their owner and showering the breakfasters with droplet of water it wa clearly raining hard outside hedwig wa nowhere to be seen but harry wa hardly surprised his only correspondent wa sirius and he doubted sirius would have anything new to tell him after only twentyfour hour apart hermione however had to move her orange juice aside quickly to make way for a large damp barn owl bearing a sodden daily prophet in it beak what are you still getting that for said harry irritably thinking of seamus a hermione placed a knut in the leather pouch on the owl leg and it took off again i am not bothering load of rubbish it best to know what the enemy are saying said hermione darkly and she unfurled the newspaper and disappeared behind it not emerging until harry and ron had finished eating page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling nothing she said simply rolling up the newspaper and laying it down by her plate nothing about you or dumbledore or anything professor mcgonagall wa now moving along the table handing out schedule look at today groaned ron history of magic double potion divination and double defense against the dark art binns snape trelawney and that umbridge woman all in one day i wish fred and george d hurry up and get those skiving snackboxes sorted do mine ear deceive me said fred arriving with george and squeezing onto the bench beside harry hogwarts prefect surely do not wish to skive off lesson look what we have got today said ron grumpily shoving his schedule under freds nose that is the worst monday i have ever seen fair point little bro said fred scanning the column you can have a bit of nosebleed nougat cheap if you like why is it cheap said ron suspiciously because you will keep bleeding till you shrivel up we have not got an antidote yet said george helping himself to a kipper cheer said ron moodily pocketing his schedule but i think ill take the lesson and speaking of your skiving snackboxes said hermione eyeing fred and george beadily you can not advertise for tester on the gryffindor notice board page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling say who said george looking astonished say me said hermione and ron leave me out of it said ron hastily hermione glared at him fred and george sniggered you will be singing a different tune soon enough hermione said fred thickly buttering a crumpet you are starting your fifth year you will be begging u for a snackbox before long and why would starting fifth year mean i want a skiving snackbox asked hermione fifth year owl year said george so so you have got your exam coming up have not you they will be keeping your nose so hard to that grindstone they will be rubbed raw said fred with satisfaction half our year had minor breakdown coming up to owl said george happily tear and tantrum patricia stimpson kept coming over faint kenneth towler came out in boil dyou remember said fred reminiscently that is because you put bulbadox powder in his pajama said george oh yeah said fred grinning id forgotten hard to keep track sometimes is not it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling anyway it a nightmare of a year the fifth said george if you care about exam result anyway fred and i managed to keep our spirit up somehow yeah you got what wa it three owl each said ron yep said fred unconcernedly but we feel our future lie outside the world of academic achievement we seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year said george brightly now that we have got he broke off at a warning look from harry who knew george had been about to mention the triwizard winning he had given them now that we have got our owl george said hastily i mean do we really need newt but we did not think mum could take u leaving school early not on top of percy turning out to be the world biggest prat were not going to waste our last year here though said fred looking affectionately around at the great hall were going to use it to do a bit of market research find out exactly what the average hogwarts student requires from his joke shop carefully evaluate the result of our research and then produce the product to fit the demand but where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop asked hermione skeptically you are going to need all the ingredient and material and premise too i suppose page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry did not look at the twin his face felt hot he deliberately dropped his fork and dived down to retrieve it he heard fred say overhead ask u no question and well tell you no lie hermione cmon george if we get there early we might be able to sell a few extendable ear before herbology harry emerged from under the table to see fred and george walking away each carrying a stack of toast what did that mean said hermione looking from harry to ron ask u no question doe that mean they have already got some gold to start a joke shop you know i have been wondering about that said ron his brow furrowed they bought me a new set of dress robe this summer and i could not understand where they got the galleon harry decided it wa time to steer the conversation out of these dangerous water dyou reckon it true this year going to be really tough because of the exam oh yeah said ron bound to be is not it owl are really important affect the job you can apply for and everything we get career advice too later this year bill told me so you can choose what newt you want to do next year dyou know what you want to do after hogwarts harry asked the other two a they left the great hall shortly afterward and set off toward their history of magic classroom not really said ron slowly except well page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he looked slightly sheepish what harry urged him well it would be cool to be an auror said ron in an offhand voice yeah it would said harry fervently but they are like the elite said ron you have got to be really good what about you hermione i do not know said hermione i think id really like to do something worthwhile an aurors worthwhile said harry yes it is but it not the only worthwhile thing said hermione thoughtfully i mean if i could take spew further harry and ron carefully avoided looking at each other history of magic wa by common consent the most boring subject ever devised by wizardkind professor binns their ghost teacher had a wheezy droning voice that wa almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minute five in warm weather he never varied the form of their lesson but lectured them without pausing while they took note or rather gazed sleepily into space harry and ron had so far managed to scrape pass in this subject only by copying hermiones note before exam she alone seemed able to resist the soporific power of binns s voice today they suffered through three quarter of an hour droning on the subject of giant war harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling heard just enough within the first ten minute to appreciate dimly that in another teacher hand this subject might have been mildly interesting but then his brain disengaged and he spent the remaining thirtyfive minute playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with ron while hermione shot them filthy look out of the corner of her eye how would it be she asked them coldly a they left the classroom for break binns drifting away through the blackboard if i refused to lend you my note this year wed fail our owl said ron if you want that on your conscience hermione well you would deserve it she snapped you do not even try to listen to him do you we do try said ron we just have not got your brain or your memory or your concentration you are just cleverer than we are is it nice to rub it in oh do not give me that rubbish said hermione but she looked slightly mollified a she led the way out into the damp courtyard a fine misty drizzle wa falling so that the people standing in huddle around the yard looked blurred at the edge harry ron and hermione chose a secluded corner under a heavily dripping balcony turning up the collar of their robe against the chilly september air and talking about what snape wa likely to set them in the first lesson of the year they had got a far a agreeing that it wa likely to be something extremely difficult just to catch them off guard after a twomonth holiday when someone walked around the corner toward them page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hello harry it wa cho chang and what wa more she wa on her own again this wa most unusual cho wa almost always surrounded by a gang of giggling girl harry remembered the agony of trying to get her by herself to ask her to the yule ball hi said harry feeling his face grow hot at least you are not covered in stinksap this time he told himself cho seemed to be thinking along the same line you got that stuff off then yeah said harry trying to grin a though the memory of their last meeting wa funny a opposed to mortifying so did you er have a good summer the moment he had said this he wished he had not cedric had been chos boyfriend and the memory of his death must have affected her holiday almost a badly a it had affected harrys something seemed to tauten in her face but she said oh it wa all right you know is that a tornado badge ron demanded suddenly pointing at the front of chos robe to which a sky blue badge emblazoned with a double gold t wa pinned you do not support them do you yeah i do said cho have you always supported them or just since they started winning the league said ron in what harry considered an unnecessarily accusatory tone of voice i have supported them since i wa six said cho coolly anyway see you harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she walked away hermione waited until cho wa halfway across the courtyard before rounding on ron you are so tactless what i only asked her if could not you tell she wanted to talk to harry on her own so she could have done i wa not stopping what on earth were you attacking her about her quidditch team for attacking i wa not attacking her i wa only who care if she support the tornado oh come on half the people you see wearing those badge only bought them last season but what doe it matter it mean they are not real fan they are just jumping on the bandwagon that is the bell said harry listlessly because ron and hermione were bickering too loudly to hear it they did not stop arguing all the way down to snapes dungeon which gave harry plenty of time to reflect that between neville and ron he would be lucky ever to have two minute conversation with cho that he could look back on without wanting to leave the country and yet he thought a they joined the queue lining up outside snapes classroom door she had chosen to come and talk to him had not she she had been page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling cedrics girlfriend she could easily have hated harry for coming out of the triwizard maze alive when cedric had died yet she wa talking to him in a perfectly friendly way not a though she thought him mad or a liar or in some horrible way responsible for cedrics death yes she had definitely chosen to come and talk to him and that made the second time in two day and at this thought harrys spirit rose even the ominous sound of snapes dungeon door creaking open did not puncture the small hopeful bubble that seemed to have swelled in his chest he filed into the classroom behind ron and hermione and followed them to their usual table at the back ignoring the huffy irritable noise now issuing from both of them settle down said snape coldly shutting the door behind him there wa no real need for the call to order the moment the class had heard the door close quiet had fallen and all fidgeting stopped snapes mere presence wa usually enough to ensure a class silence before we begin today lesson said snape sweeping over to his desk and staring around at them all i think it appropriate to remind you that next june you will be sitting an important examination during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potion moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are i expect you to scrape an acceptable in your owl or suffer my displeasure his gaze lingered this time upon neville who gulped page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling after this year of course many of you will cease studying with me snape went on i take only the very best into my newt potion class which mean that some of u will certainly be saying good bye his eye rested on harry and his lip curled harry glared back feeling a grim pleasure at the idea that he would be able to give up potion after fifth year but we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell said snape softly so whether you are intending to attempt newt or not i advise all of you to concentrate your effort upon maintaining the highpass level i have come to expect from my owl student today we will be mixing a potion that often come up at ordinary wizarding level the draught of peace a potion to calm anxiety and soothe agitation be warned if you are too heavyhanded with the ingredient you will put the drinker into a heavy and sometimes irreversible sleep so you will need to pay close attention to what you are doing on harrys left hermione sat up a little straighter her expression one of the utmost attentiveness the ingredient and method snape flicked his wand are on the blackboard they appeared there you will find everything you need he flicked his wand again in the store cupboard the door of the said cupboard sprang open you have an hour and a half start just a harry ron and hermione had predicted snape could hardly have set them a more difficult fiddly potion the ingredient had to be added to the cauldron in precisely the right order and quantity the mixture had to be stirred exactly the right number of time firstly in clockwise then in counterclockwise page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling direction the heat of the flame on which it wa simmering had to be lowered to exactly the right level for a specific number of minute before the final ingredient wa added a light silver vapor should now be rising from your potion called snape with ten minute left to go harry who wa sweating profusely looked desperately around the dungeon his own cauldron wa issuing copious amount of dark gray steam ron wa spitting green spark seamus wa feverishly prodding the flame at the base of his cauldron with the tip of his wand a they had gone out the surface of hermiones potion however wa a shimmering mist of silver vapor and a snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment which meant that he could find nothing to criticize at harrys cauldron however snape stopped looking down at harry with a horrible smirk on his face potter what is this supposed to be the slytherins at the front of the class all looked up eagerly they loved hearing snape taunt harry the draught of peace said harry tensely tell me potter said snape softly can you read draco malfoy laughed yes i can said harry his finger clenched tightly around his wand read the third line of the instruction for me potter page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry squinted at the blackboard it wa not easy to make out the instruction through the haze of multicolored steam now filling the dungeon add powdered moonstone stir three time counterclockwise allow to simmer for seven minute then add two drop of syrup of hellebore his heart sank he had not added syrup of hellebore but had proceeded straight to the fourth line of the instruction after allowing his potion to simmer for seven minute did you do everything on the third line potter no said harry very quietly i beg your pardon no said harry more loudly i forgot the hellebore i know you did potter which mean that this mess is utterly worthless evanesco the content of harrys potion vanished he wa left standing foolishly beside an empty cauldron those of you who have managed to read the instruction fill one flagon with a sample of your potion label it clearly with your name and bring it up to my desk for testing said snape homework twelve inch of parchment on the property of moonstone and it us in potionmaking to be handed in on thursday while everyone around him filled their flagon harry cleared away his thing seething his potion had been no worse than ron which wa now giving off a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling foul odor of bad egg or nevilles which had achieved the consistency of justmixed cement and which neville wa now having to gouge out of his cauldron yet it wa he harry who would be receiving zero mark for the day work he stuffed his wand back into his bag and slumped down onto his seat watching everyone else march up to snapes desk with filled and corked flagon when at long last the bell rang harry wa first out of the dungeon and had already started his lunch by the time ron and hermione joined him in the great hall the ceiling had turned an even murkier gray during the morning rain wa lashing the high window that wa really unfair said hermione consolingly sitting down next to harry and helping herself to shepherd pie your potion wa not nearly a bad a goyles when he put it in his flagon the whole thing shattered and set his robe on fire yeah well said harry glowering at his plate since when ha snape ever been fair to me neither of the others answered all three of them knew that snape and harrys mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment harry had set foot in hogwarts i did think he might be a bit better this year said hermione in a disappointed voice i mean you know she looked carefully around there were half a dozen empty seat on either side of them and nobody wa passing the table now he in the order and everything poisonous toadstool do not change their spot said ron sagely anyway i have always thought dumbledore wa cracked trusting snape where is the evidence he ever really stopped working for youknowwho page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i think dumbledores probably got plenty of evidence even if he doe not share it with you ron snapped hermione oh shut up the pair of you said harry heavily a ron opened his mouth to argue back hermione and ron both froze looking angry and offended can not you give it a rest he said you are always having a go at each other it driving me mad and abandoning his shepherd pie he swung his schoolbag back over his shoulder and left them sitting there he walked up the marble staircase two step at a time past the many student hurrying toward lunch the anger that had just flared so unexpectedly still blazed inside him and the vision of ron and hermione s shocked face afforded him a sense of deep satisfaction serve them right he thought why can not they give it a rest bickering all the time it enough to drive anyone up the wall he passed the large picture of sir cadogan the knight on a landing sir cadogan drew his sword and brandished it fiercely at harry who ignored him come back you scurvy dog stand fast and fight yelled sir cadogan in a muffled voice from behind his visor but harry merely walked on and when sir cadogan attempted to follow him by running into a neighboring picture he wa rebuffed by it inhabitant a large and angrylooking wolfhound harry spent the rest of the lunch hour sitting alone underneath the trapdoor at the top of north tower and consequently he wa the first to ascend the silver ladder that led to sibyll trelawneys classroom when the bell rang page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling divination wa harrys least favorite class after potion which wa due mainly to professor trelawneys habit of predicting his premature death every few lesson a thin woman heavily draped in shawl and glittering with string of bead she always reminded harry of some kind of insect with her glass hugely magnifying her eye she wa busy putting copy of battered leatherbound book on each of the spindly little table with which her room wa littered when harry entered the room but so dim wa the light cast by the lamp covered by scarf and the lowburning sicklyscented fire that she appeared not to notice him a he took a seat in the shadow the rest of the class arrived over the next five minute ron emerged from the trapdoor looked around carefully spotted harry and made directly for him or a directly a he could while having to wend his way between table chair and overstuffed pouf hermione and me have stopped arguing he said sitting down beside harry good grunted harry but hermione say she think it would be nice if you stopped taking out your temper on u said ron i am not i am just passing on the message said ron talking over him but i reckon she is right it not our fault how seamus and snape treat you i never said it good day said professor trelawney in her usual misty dreamy voice and harry broke off feeling both annoyed and slightly ashamed of himself again and welcome back to divination i have of course been page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling following your fortune most carefully over the holiday and am delighted to see that you have all returned to hogwarts safely a of course i knew you would you will find on the table before you copy of the dream oracle by inigo imago dream interpretation is a most important mean of divining the future and one that may very probably be tested in your owl not of course that i believe examination pass or failure are of the remotest importance when it come to the sacred art of divination if you have the seeing eye certificate and grade matter very little however the headmaster like you to sit the examination so her voice trailed away delicately leaving them all in no doubt that professor trelawney considered her subject above such sordid matter a examination turn please to the introduction and read what imago ha to say on the matter of dream interpretation then divide into pair use the dream oracle to interpret each others most recent dream carry on the one good thing to be said for this lesson wa that it wa not a double period by the time they had all finished reading the introduction of the book they had barely ten minute left for dream interpretation at the table next to harry and ron dean had paired up with neville who immediately embarked on a long winded explanation of a nightmare involving a pair of giant scissors wearing his grandmother best hat harry and ron merely looked at each other glumly i never remember my dream said ron you say one page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you must remember one of them said harry impatiently he wa not going to share his dream with anyone he knew perfectly well what his regular nightmare about a graveyard meant he did not need ron or professor trelawney or the stupid dream oracle to tell him that well i had one that i wa playing quidditch the other night said ron screwing up his face in an effort to remember what dyou reckon that mean probably that you are going to be eaten by a giant marshmallow or something said harry turning the page of the dream oracle without interest it wa very dull work looking up bit of dream in the oracle and harry wa not cheered up when professor trelawney set them the task of keeping a dream diary for a month a homework when the bell went he and ron led the way back down the ladder ron grumbling loudly dyou realize how much homework we have got already binns set u a footandahalflong essay on giant war snape want a foot on the use of moonstone and now we have got a month dream diary from trelawney fred and george were not wrong about owl year were they that umbridge woman had better not give u any when they entered the defense against the dark art classroom they found professor umbridge already seated at the teacher desk wearing the fluffy pink cardigan of the night before and the black velvet bow on top of her head harry wa again reminded forcibly of a large fly perched unwisely on top of an even larger toad page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the class wa quiet a it entered the room professor umbridge wa a yet an unknown quantity and nobody knew yet how strict a disciplinarian she wa likely to be well good afternoon she said when finally the whole class had sat down a few people mumbled good afternoon in reply tut tut said professor umbridge that will not do now will it i should like you please to reply good afternoon professor umbridge one more time please good afternoon class good afternoon professor umbridge they chanted back at her there now said professor umbridge sweetly that wa not too difficult wa it wand away and quill out please many of the class exchanged gloomy look the order wand away had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting harry shoved his wand back inside his bag and pulled out quill ink and parchment professor umbridge opened her handbag extracted her own wand which wa an unusually short one and tapped the blackboard sharply with it word appeared on the board at once defense against the dark art a return to basic principle well now your teaching in this subject ha been rather disrupted and fragmented ha not it stated professor umbridge turning to face the class with her hand clasped neatly in front of her the constant page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling changing of teacher many of whom do not seem to have followed any ministryapproved curriculum ha unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your owl year you will be pleased to know however that these problem are now to be rectified we will be following a carefully structured theorycentered ministry approved course of defensive magic this year copy down the following please she rapped the blackboard again the first message vanished and wa replaced by course aim understanding the principle underlying defensive magic learning to recognize situation in which defensive magic can legally be used placing the use of defensive magic in a context for practical use for a couple of minute the room wa full of the sound of scratching quill on parchment when everyone had copied down professor umbridges three course aim she said ha everybody got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard there wa a dull murmur of assent throughout the class i think well try that again said professor umbridge when i ask you a question i should like you to reply yes professor umbridge or no professor umbridge so ha everyone got a copy of defensive magical theory by wilbert slinkhard page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes professor umbridge rang through the room good said professor umbridge i should like you to turn to page five and read chapter one basic for beginner there will be no need to talk professor umbridge left the blackboard and settled herself in the chair behind the teacher desk observing them all with those pouchy toad eye harry turned to page five of his copy of defensive magical theory and started to read it wa desperately dull quite a bad a listening to professor binns he felt his concentration sliding away from him he had soon read the same line half a dozen time without taking in more than the first few word several silent minute passed next to him ron wa absentmindedly turning his quill over and over in his finger staring at the same spot on the page harry looked right and received a surprise to shake him out of his torpor hermione had not even opened her copy of defensive magical theory she wa staring fixedly at professor umbridge with her hand in the air harry could not remember hermione ever neglecting to read when instructed to or indeed resisting the temptation to open any book that came under her nose he looked at her questioningly but she merely shook her head slightly to indicate that she wa not about to answer question and continued to stare at professor umbridge who wa looking just a resolutely in another direction after several more minute had passed however harry wa not the only one watching hermione the chapter they had been instructed to read wa so tedious that more and more people were choosing to watch hermiones mute attempt to catch professor page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling umbridges eye than to struggle on with basic for beginner when more than half the class were staring at hermione rather than at their book professor umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer did you want to ask something about the chapter dear she asked hermione a though she had only just noticed her not about the chapter no said hermione well were reading just now said professor umbridge showing her small pointed teeth if you have other query we can deal with them at the end of class i have got a query about your course aim said hermione professor umbridge raised her eyebrow and your name is hermione granger said hermione well miss granger i think the course aim are perfectly clear if you read them through carefully said professor umbridge in a voice of determined sweetness well i do not said hermione bluntly there is nothing written up there about using defensive spell page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there wa a short silence in which many member of the class turned their head to frown at the three course aim still written on the blackboard using defensive spell professor umbridge repeated with a little laugh why i can not imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell miss granger you surely are not expecting to be attacked during class were not going to use magic ron ejaculated loudly student raise their hand when they wish to speak in my class mr weasley said ron thrusting his hand into the air professor umbridge smiling still more widely turned her back on him harry and hermione immediately raised their hand too professor umbridges pouchy eye lingered on harry for a moment before she addressed hermione yes miss granger you wanted to ask something else yes said hermione surely the whole point of defense against the dark art is to practice defensive spell are you a ministrytrained educational expert miss granger asked professor umbridge in her falsely sweet voice no but well then i am afraid you are not qualified to decide what the svhole point of any class is wizard much older and cleverer than you have devised our new page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling program of study you will be learning about defensive spell in a secure riskfree way what use is that said harry loudly if were going to be attacked it will not be in a hand mr potter sang professor umbridge harry thrust his fist in the air professor umbridge promptly turned away from him again but now several other people had their hand up too and your name is professor umbridge said to dean dean thomas well mr thomas well it like harry said is not it said dean if were going to be attacked it will not be riskfree i repeat said professor umbridge smiling in a very irritating fashion at dean do you expect to be attacked during my class no but professor umbridge talked over him i do not wish to criticize the way thing have been run in this school she said an unconvincing smile stretching her wide mouth but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizard in this class very irresponsible indeed not to mention she gave a nasty little laugh extremely dangerous halfbreeds page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling if you mean professor lupin piped up dean thomas angrily he wa the best we ever hand mr thomas a i wa saying you have been introduced to spell that have been complex inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal you have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet dark attack every other day no we have not hermione said we just your hand is not up miss grangeii hermione put up her hand professor umbridge turned away from her it is my understanding that my predecessor not only performed illegal curse in front of you he actually performed them on you well he turned out to be a maniac did not he said dean thomas hotly mind you we still learned load your hand is not up mr thomasy trilled professor umbridge now it is the view of the ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination which after all is what school is all about and your name is she added staring at parvati whose hand had just shot up parvati patil and is not there a practical bit in our defense against the dark art owl are not we supposed to show that we can actually do the countercurses and thing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a long a you have studied the theory hard enough there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spell under carefully controlled examination condition said professor umbridge dismissively without ever practicing them before said parvati incredulously are you telling u that the first time well get to do the spell will be during our exam i repeat a long a you have studied the theory hard enough and what good theory going to be in the real world said harry loudly his fist in the air again professor umbridge looked up this is school mr potter not the real world she said softly so were not supposed to be prepared for what is waiting out there there is nothing waiting out there mr potter oh yeah said harry his temper which seemed to have been bubbling just beneath the surface all day wa reaching boiling point who do you imagine want to attack child like yourselves inquired professor umbridge in a horribly honeyed voice hmm let u think said harry in a mock thoughtful voice maybe lord voldemort ron gasped lavender brown uttered a little scream neville slipped sideways off his stool professor page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling umbridge however did not flinch she wa staring at harry with a grimly satisfied expression on her face ten point from gryffindor mr potter the classroom wa silent and still everyone wa staring at either umbridge or harry now let me make a few thing quite plain professor umbridge stood up and leaned toward them her stubbyfingered hand splayed on her desk you have been told that a certain dark wizard ha returned from the dead he wa not dead said harry angrily but yeah he returned mrpotteryouhavealreadylostyourhouseten pointsdonotmakemattersworseforyourself said professor umbridge in one breath without looking at him a i wa saying you have been informed that a certain dark wizard is at large once again this is a lie it is not a lie said harry i saw him i fought him detention mr potter said professor umbridge triumphantly tomorrow evening five of the clock my office i repeat this is a lie the ministry of magic guarantee that you are not in danger from any dark wizard if you are still worried by all mean come and see me outside class hour if someone is alarming you with fib about reborn dark wizard i would like to hear about it i am here to help i am your friend and now you will kindly continue your reading page five basic for beginner page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor umbridge sat down behind her desk again harry however stood up everyone wa staring at him seamus looked halfscared halffascinated harry no hermione whispered in a warning voice tugging at his sleeve but harry jerked his arm out of her reach so according to you cedric diggory dropped dead of his own accord did he harry asked his voice shaking there wa a collective intake of breath from the class for none of them apart from ron and hermione had ever heard harry talk about what had happened on the night that cedric had died they stared avidly from harry to professor umbridge who had raised her eye and wa staring at him without a trace of a fake smile on her face cedric diggorys death wa a tragic accident she said coldly it wa murder said harry he could feel himself shaking he had hardly talked to anyone about this least of all thirty eagerly listening classmate voldemort killed him and you know it professor umbridges face wa quite blank for a moment he thought she wa going to scream at him then she said in her softest most sweetly girlish voice come here mr potter dear he kicked his chair aside strode around ron and hermione and up to the teacher desk he could feel the rest of the class holding it breath he felt so angry he did not care what happened next page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor umbridge pulled a small roll of pink parchment out of her handbag stretched it out on the desk dipped her quill into a bottle of ink and started scribbling hunched over so that harry could not see what she wa writing nobody spoke after a minute or so she rolled up the parchment and tapped it with her wand it sealed itself seamlessly so that he could not open it take this to professor mcgonagall dear said professor umbridge holding out the note to him he took it from her without saying a word and left the room not even looking back at ron and hermione and slamming the classroom door shut behind him he walked very fast along the corridor the note to mcgonagall clutched tight in his hand and turning a corner walked slap into peeve the poltergeist a wide faced little man floating on his back in midair juggling several inkwell why it potty wee potter cackled peeve allowing two of the inkwell to fall to the ground where they smashed and spattered the wall with ink harry jumped backward out of the way with a snarl get out of it peeve oooh crackpot feeling cranky said peeve pursuing harry along the corridor leering a he zoomed along above him what is it this time my fine potty friend hearing voice seeing vision speaking in peeve blew a gigantic raspberry tongue i said leave me alone harry shouted running down the nearest flight of stair but peeve merely slid down the banister on his back beside him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh most think he barking the potty wee lad but some are more kindly and think he just sad but peevesy know better and say that he mad shut up a door to his left flew open and professor mcgonagall emerged from her office looking grim and slightly harassed what on earth are you shouting about potter she snapped a peeve cackled gleefully and zoomed out of sight why are not you in class i have been sent to see you said harry stiffly sent what do you mean sent he held out the note from professor umbridge professor mcgonagall took it from him frowning slit it open with a tap of her wand stretched it out and began to read her eye zoomed from side to side behind their square spectacle a she read what umbridge had written and with each line they became narrower come in here potter he followed her inside her study the door closed automatically behind him well said professor mcgonagall rounding on him is this true is what true harry asked rather more aggressively than he had intended professor he added in an attempt to sound more polite page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling is it true that you shouted at professor umbridge yes said harry you called her a liar yes you told her hewhomustnotbenamed is back yes professor mcgonagall sat down behind her desk frowning at harry then she said have a biscuit potter have what have a biscuit she repeated impatiently indicating a tartan tin of cooky lying on top of one of the pile of paper on her desk and sit down there had been a previous occasion when harry expecting to be caned by professor mcgonagall had instead been appointed by her to the gryffindor quidditch team he sank into a chair opposite her and helped himself to a ginger newt feeling just a confused and wrongfooted a he had done on that occasion professor mcgonagall set down professor umbridges note and looked very seriously at harry potter you need to be careful harry swallowed his mouthful of ginger newt and stared at her her tone of voice wa not at all what he wa used to it wa not brisk crisp and stern it wa page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling low and anxious and somehow much more human than usual misbehavior in dolores umbridges class could cost you much more than house point and a detention what do you potter use your common sense snapped professor mcgonagall with an abrupt return to her usual manner you know where she come from you must know to whom she is reporting the bell rang for the end of the lesson overhead and all around came the elephantine sound of hundred of student on the move it say here she is given you detention every evening this week starting tomorrow professor mcgonagall said looking down at umbridges note again every evening this week harry repeated horrified but professor could not you no i could not said professor mcgonagall flatly but she is your teacher and ha every right to give you detention you will go to her room at five of the clock tomorrow for the first one just remember tread carefully around dolores umbridge but i wa telling the truth said harry outraged voldemorts back you know he is professor dumbledore know he is for heaven sake potter said professor mcgonagall straightening her glass angrily she page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling had winced horribly when he had used voldemorts name do you really think this is about truth or lie it about keeping your head down and your temper under control she stood up nostril wide and mouth very thin and he stood too have another biscuit she said irritably thrusting the tin at him no thanks said harry coldly do not be ridiculous she snapped he took one thanks he said grudgingly did not you listen to dolores umbridges speech at the startofterm feast potter yeah said harry yeah she said progress will be prohibited or well it meant that that the ministry of magic is trying to interfere at hogwarts professor mcgonagall eyed him for a moment then sniffed walked around her desk and held open the door for him well i am glad you listen to hermione granger at any rate she said pointing him out of her office page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling detention with dolores dinner in the great hall that night wa not a pleasant experience for harry the news about his shouting match with umbridge seemed to have traveled exceptionally fast even by hogwarts standard he heard whisper all around him a he sat eating between ron and hermione the funny thing wa that none of the whisperer seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him on the contrary it wa a though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again so that they could hear his story firsthand he say he saw cedric diggory murdered he reckons he dueled with youknowwho come off it who doe he think he kidding pur lease page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what i do not get said harry in a shaking voice laying down his knife and fork his hand were trembling too much to hold them steady is why they all believed the story two month ago when dumbledore told them the thing is harry i am not sure they did said hermione grimly oh let u get out of here she slammed down her own knife and fork ron looked sadly at his halffinished apple pie but followed suit people stared at them all the way out of the hall what dyou mean you are not sure they believed dumbledore harry asked hermione when they reached the firstfloor landing look you do not understand what it wa like after it happened said hermione quietly you arrived back in the middle of the lawn clutching cedrics dead body none of u saw what happened in the maze we just had dumbledores word for it that youknow who had come back and killed cedric and fought you which is the truth said harry loudly i know it is harry so will you please stop biting my head off said hermione wearily it just that before the truth could sink in everyone went home for the summer where they spent two month reading about how you are a nutcase and dumbledores going senile rain pounded on the windowpane a they strode along the empty corridor back to gryffindor tower harry felt a though his first day had lasted a week but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed a dull pounding pain wa developing over his page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling right eye he glanced out of a rainwashed window at the dark ground a they turned into the fat lady corridor there wa still no light in hagrids cabin mimbulus mimbletonia said hermione before the fat lady could ask the portrait swung open to reveal the hole behind and the three of them scrambled back through it the common room wa almost empty nearly everyone wa still down at dinner crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them purring loudly and when harry ron and hermione took their three favorite chair at the fireside he leapt lightly into hermione s lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion harry gazed into the flame feeling drained and exhausted how can dumbledore have let this happen hermione cried suddenly making harry and ron jump crookshanks leapt off her looking affronted she pounded the arm of her chair in fury so that bit of stuffing leaked out of the hole how can he let that terrible woman teach u and in our owl year too well we have never had great defense against the dark art teacher have we said harry you know what it like hagrid told u nobody want the job they say it jinxed yes but to employ someone who is actually refusing to let u do magic what is dumbledore playing at and she is trying to get people to spy for her said ron darkly remember when she said she wanted u to come and tell her if we hear anyone saying you know who is back page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling of course she is here to spy on u all that is obvious why else would fudge have wanted her to come snapped hermione do not start arguing again said harry wearily a ron opened his mouth to retaliate can not we just let u just do that homework get it out of the way they collected their schoolbag from a corner and returned to the chair by the fire people were coming back from dinner now harry kept his face averted from the portrait hole but could still sense the stare he wa attracting shall we do snapes stuff first said ron dipping his quill into his ink the property of moonstone and it us in potionmaking he muttered writing the word across the top of his parchment a he spoke them there he underlined the title then looked up expectantly at hermione so what are the property of moonstone and it us in potionmaking but hermione wa not listening she wa squinting over into the far corner of the room where fred george and lee jordan were now sitting at the center of a knot of innocentlooking first year all of whom were chewing something that seemed to have come out of a large paper bag that fred wa holding no i am sorry they have gone too far she said standing up and looking positively furious come on ron i what said ron plainly playing for time no come on hermione we can not tell them off for giving out sweet page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you know perfectly well that those are bit of nosebleed nougat or or puking pastille or fainting fancy harry suggested quietly one by one a though hit over the head with invisible mallet the first year were slumping unconscious in their seat some slid right onto the floor others merely hung over the arm of their chair their tongue lolling out most of the people watching were laughing hermione however squared her shoulder and marched directly over to where fred and george now stood with clipboard closely observing the unconscious first year ron rose halfway out of his chair hovered uncertainly for a moment or two then muttered to harry she is got it under control before sinking a low in his chair a his lanky frame permitted that is enough hermione said forcefully to fred and george both of whom looked up in mild surprise yeah you are right said george nodding this dosage look strong enough doe not it i told you this morning you can not test your rubbish on student were paying them said fred indignantly i do not care it could be dangerous rubbish said fred calm down hermione they are fine said lee reassuringly a he walked from first year to first year inserting purple sweet into their open mouth yeah look they are coming round now said george page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a few of the first year were indeed stirring several looked so shocked to find themselves lying on the floor or dangling off their chair that harry wa sure fred and george had not warned them what the sweet were going to do feel all right said george kindly to a small dark haired girl lying at his foot ii think so she said shakily excellent said fred happily but the next second hermione had snatched both his clipboard and the paper bag of fainting fancy from his hand it is not excellent course it is they are alive are not they said fred angrily you can not do this what if you made one of them really ill were not going to make them ill we have already tested them all on ourselves this is just to see if everyone reacts the same if you do not stop doing it i am going to put u in detention said fred in an idliketosee youtryit voice make u write line said george smirking onlooker all over the room were laughing hermione drew herself up to her full height her eye were narrowed and her bushy hair seemed to crackle with electricity page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no she said her voice quivering with anger but i will write to your mother you would not said george horrified taking a step back from her oh yes i would said hermione grimly i can not stop you eating the stupid thing yourselves but you are not giving them to first year fred and george looked thunderstruck it wa clear that a far a they were concerned hermione s threat wa way below the belt with a last threatening look at them she thrust freds clipboard and the bag of fancy back into his arm and stalked back to her chair by the fire ron wa now so low in his seat that his nose wa roughly level with his knee thank you for your support ron hermione said acidly you handled it fine by yourself ron mumbled hermione stared down at her blank piece of parchment for a few second then said edgily oh it no good i can not concentrate now i am going to bed she wrenched her bag open harry thought she wa about to put her book away but instead she pulled out two misshapen woolly object placed them carefully on a table by the fireplace covered them with a few screwedup bit of parchment and a broken quill and stood back to admire the effect what in the name of merlin are you doing said ron watching her a though fearful for her sanity page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they are hat for houseelves she said briskly now stuffing her book back into her bag i did them over the summer i am a really slow knitter without magic but now i am back at school i should be able to make lot more you are leaving out hat for the houseelves said ron slowly and you are covering them up with rubbish first yes said hermione defiantly swinging her bag onto her back that is not on said ron angrily you are trying to trick them into picking up the hat you are setting them free when they might not want to be free of course they want to be free said hermione at once though her face wa turning pink do not you dare touch those hat ron she left ron waited until she had disappeared through the door to the girl dormitory then cleared the rubbish off the woolly hat they should at least see what they are picking up he said firmly anyway he rolled up the parchment on which he had written the title of snapes essay there is no point trying to finish this now i can not do it without hermione i have not got a clue what you are supposed to do with moonstone have you harry shook his head noticing a he did so that the ache in his right temple wa getting worse he thought of the long essay on giant war and the pain stabbed at him sharply knowing perfectly well that he would regret not finishing his homework tonight when the morning came he piled his book back into his bag page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tm going to bed too he passed seamus on the way to the door leading to the dormitory but did not look at him harry had a fleeting impression that seamus had opened his mouth to speak but sped up and reached the soothing peace of the stone spiral staircase without having to endure any more provocation the following day dawned just a leaden and rainy a the previous one hagrid wa still absent from the staff table at breakfast but on the plus side no snape today said ron bracingly hermione yawned widely and poured herself some coffee she looked mildly pleased about something and when ron asked her what she had to be so happy about she simply said the hat have gone seems the houseelves do want freedom after all i would not bet on it ron told her cuttingly they might not count a clothes they did not look anything like hat to me more like woolly bladder hermione did not speak to him all morning double charm wa succeeded by double transfiguration professor flitwick and professor mcgonagall both spent the first fifteen minute of their lesson lecturing the class on the importance of owl what you must remember said little professor flitwick squeakily perched a ever on a pile of book so that he could see over the top of his desk is that these examination may influence your future for many year to come if you have not already given page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling serious thought to your career now is the time to do so and in the meantime i am afraid we shall be working harder than ever to ensure that you all do yourselves justice they then spent more than an hour reviewing summoning charm which according to professor flitwick were bound to come up in their owl and he rounded off the lesson by setting them their largest amount of charm homework ever it wa the same if not worse in transfiguration you can not pas an owl said professor mcgonagall grimly without serious application practice and study i see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an owl in transfiguration a long a they put in the work neville made a sad little disbelieving noise yes you too longbottom said professor mcgonagall there is nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence so today we are starting vanishing spell these are easier than conjuring spell which you would not usually attempt until newt level but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your owl she wa quite right harry found the vanishing spell horribly difficult by the end of a double period neither he nor ron had managed to vanish the snail on which they were practicing though ron said hopefully that he thought his looked a bit paler hermione on the other hand successfully vanished her snail on the third attempt earning her a tenpoint bonus for gryffindor from professor mcgonagall she wa the only person not given homework everybody else wa told to practice the spell overnight ready for a fresh attempt on their snail the following afternoon page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling now panicking slightly about the amount of homework they had to do harry and ron spent their lunch hour in the library looking up the us of moonstone in potionmaking still angry about ron slur on her woolly hat hermione did not join them by the time they reached care of magical creature in the afternoon harrys head wa aching again the day had become cool and breezy and a they walked down the sloping lawn toward hagrids cabin on the edge of the forbidden forest they felt the occasional drop of rain on their face professor grubblyplank stood waiting for the class some ten yard from hagrids front door a long trestle table in front of her laden with many twig a harry and ron reached her a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them turning they saw draco malfoy striding toward them surrounded by his usual gang of slytherin crony he had clearly just said something highly amusing because crabbe goyle pansy parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily a they gathered around the trestle table judging by the fact that all of them kept looking over at harry he wa able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty everyone here barked professor grubblyplank once all the slytherins and gryffindors had arrived let u crack on then who can tell me what these thing are called she indicated the heap of twig in front of her hermione s hand shot into the air behind her back malfoy did a bucktoothed imitation of her jumping up and down in eagerness to answer a question pansy parkinson gave a shriek of laughter that turned almost at once into a scream a the twig on the table leapt into the air and revealed themselves to be what looked like tiny pixieish creature made of wood page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling each with knobbly brown arm and leg two twiglike finger at the end of each hand and a funny flat barklike face in which a pair of beetlebrown eye glittered oooooh said parvati and lavender thoroughly irritating harry anyone would have thought that hagrid never showed them impressive creature admittedly the flobberworms had been a bit dull but the salamander and hippogriffs had been interesting enough and the blastended skrewts perhaps too much so kindly keep your voice down girl said professor grubblyplank sharply scattering a handful of what looked like brown rice among the stickcreatures who immediately fell upon the food so anyone know the name of these creature miss granger bowtruckles said hermione they are tree guardian usually live in wandtrees five point for gryffindor said professor grubbly plank yes these are bowtruckles and a miss granger rightly say they generally live in tree whose wood is of wand quality anybody know what they eat wood louse said hermione promptly which explained why what harry had taken for grain of brown rice were moving but fairy egg if they can get them good girl take another five point so whenever you need leaf or wood from a tree in which a bowtruckle lodge it is wise to have a gift of wood louse ready to distract or placate it they may not look dangerous but if angered they will gouge out human eye with their finger which a you can see are very sharp and not at all desirable near the eyeball page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling so if you would like to gather closer take a few wood louse and a bowtruckle i have enough here for one between three you can study them more closely i want a sketch from each of you with all body part labeled by the end of the lesson the class surged forward around the trestle table harry deliberately circled around the back so that he ended up right next to professor grubblyplank where is hagrid he asked her while everyone else wa choosing bowtruckles never you mind said professor grubblyplank repressively which had been her attitude last time hagrid had failed to turn up for a class too smirking all over his pointed face draco malfoy leaned across harry and seized the largest bowtruckle maybe said malfoy in an undertone so that only harry could hear him the stupid great oaf got himself badly injured maybe you will if you do not shut up said harry out of the side of his mouth maybe he been messing with stuff that is too big for him if you get my drift malfoy walked away smirking over his shoulder at harry who suddenly felt sick did malfoy know something his father wa a death eater after all what if he had information about hagrid s fate that had not yet reached the order ear he hurried back around the table to ron and hermione who were squatting on the grass some distance away and attempting to persuade a bowtruckle to remain still long enough to draw it harry pulled out parchment page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and quill crouched down beside the others and related in a whisper what malfoy had just said dumbledore would know if something had happened to hagrid said hermione at once it just playing into malfoys hand to look worried it tell him we do not know exactly what is going on we have got to ignore him harry here hold the bowtruckle for a moment just so i can draw it face yes came malfoys clear drawl from the group nearest them father wa talking to the minister just a couple of day ago you know and it sound a though the ministry really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place so even if that overgrown moron doe show up again hell probably be sent packing straight away ouch harry had gripped the bowtruckle so hard that it had almost snapped it had just taken a great retaliatory swipe at his hand with it sharp finger leaving two long deep cut there harry dropped it crabbe and goyle who had already been guffawing at the idea of hagrid being sacked laughed still harder a the bowtruckle set off at full tilt toward the forest a little moving stickman soon swallowed up by the tree root when the bell echoed distantly over the ground harry rolled up his bloodstained bowtruckle picture and marched off to herbology with his hand wrapped in a handkerchief of hermione s and malfoys derisive laughter still ringing in his ear if he call hagrid a moron one more time snarled harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry do not go picking a row with malfoy do not forget he a prefect now he could make life difficult for you wow i wonder what it would be like to have a difficult life said harry sarcastically ron laughed but hermione frowned together they traipsed across the vegetable patch the sky still appeared unable to make up it mind whether it wanted to rain or not i just wish hagrid would hurry up and get back that is all said harry in a low voice a they reached the greenhouse and do not say that grubblyplank woman a better teacher he added threateningly i wa not going to said hermione calmly because she will never be a good a hagrid said harry firmly fully aware that he had just experienced an exemplary care of magical creature lesson and wa thoroughly annoyed about it the door of the nearest greenhouse opened and some fourth year spilled out of it including ginny hi she said brightly a she passed a few second later luna lovegood emerged trailing behind the rest of the class a smudge of earth on her nose and her hair tied in a knot on the top of her head when she saw harry her prominent eye seemed to bulge excitedly and she made a beeline straight for him many of his classmate turned curiously to watch luna took a great breath and then said without so much a a preliminary hello i believe hewhomust notbenamed is back and i believe you fought him and escaped from him er right said harry awkwardly luna wa wearing what looked like a pair of orange radish for page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling earring a fact that parvati and lavender seemed to have noticed a they were both giggling and pointing at her earlobe you can laugh luna said her voice rising apparently under the impression that parvati and lavender were laughing at what she had said rather than what she wa wearing but people used to believe there were no such thing a the blibbering humdinger or the crumplehorned snorkack well they were right were not they said hermione impatiently there were not any such thing a the blibbering humdinger or the crumplehorned snorkack luna gave her a withering look and flounced away radish swinging madly parvati and lavender were not the only one hooting with laughter now dyou mind not offending the only people who believe me harry asked hermione a they made their way into class oh for heaven sake harry you can do better than her said hermione ginnys told me all about her apparently she will only believe in thing a long a there is no proof at all well i would not expect anything else from someone whose father run the quibbler harry thought of the sinister winged horse he had seen on the night he had arrived and how luna had said she could see them too his spirit sank slightly had she been lying but before he could devote much more thought to the matter ernie macmillan had stepped up to him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i want you to know potter he said in a loud carrying voice that it not only weirdo who support you i personally believe you one hundred percent my family have always stood firm behind dumbledore and so do i er thanks very much ernie said harry taken aback but pleased ernie might be pompous on occasion like these but harry wa in a mood to deeply appreciate a vote of confidence from somebody who wa not wearing radish in their ear ernies word had certainly wiped the smile from lavender brown face and a he turned to talk to ron and hermione harry caught seamuss expression which looked both confused and defiant to nobody surprise professor sprout started their lesson by lecturing them about the importance of owl harry wished all the teacher would stop doing this he wa starting to get an anxious twisted feeling in his stomach every time he remembered how much homework he had to do a feeling that worsened dramatically when professor sprout gave them yet another essay at the end of class tired and smelling strongly of dragon dung professor sprout preferred brand of fertilizer the gryffindors trooped back up to the castle an hour and a half later none of them talking very much it had been another long day a harry wa starving and he had his first detention with umbridge at five of the clock he headed straight for dinner without dropping off his bag in gryffindor tower so that he could bolt something down before facing whatever she had in store for him he had barely reached the entrance of the great hall however when a loud and angry voice said oy potter page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what now he muttered wearily turning to face angelina johnson who looked a though she wa in a towering temper ill tell you what now she said marching straight up to him and poking him hard in the chest with her finger how come you have landed yourself in detention for five of the clock on friday what said harry why oh yeah keeper tryout now he remembers snarled angelina did not i tell you i wanted to do a tryout with the whole team and find someone who fitted in with everyone did not i tell you id booked the quidditch pitch specially and now you have decided you are not going to be there i did not decide not to be there said harry stung by the injustice of these word i got detention from that umbridge woman just because i told her the truth about youknowwho well you can just go straight to her and ask her to let you off on friday said angelina fiercely and i do not care how you do it tell her youknowwho s a figment of your imagination if you like just make sure you are therel she stormed away you know what harry said to ron and hermione a they entered the great hall i think wed better check with puddlemere united whether oliver wood been killed during a training session because she seems to be channeling his spirit what dyou reckon are the odds of umbridge letting you off on friday said ron skeptically a they sat down at the gryffindor table page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling le than zero said harry glumly tipping lamb chop onto his plate and starting to eat better try though had not i ill offer to do two more detention or something i do not know he swallowed a mouthful of potato and added i hope she doe not keep me too long this evening you realize we have got to write three essay practice vanishing spell for mcgonagall work out a countercharm for flitwick finish the bowtruckle drawing and start that stupid dream diary for trelawney ron moaned and for some reason glanced up at the ceiling and it look like it going to rain what is that got to do with our homework said hermione her eyebrow raised nothing said ron at once his ear reddening at five to five harry bade the other two goodbye and set off for umbridges office on the third floor when he knocked on the door she said come in in a sugary voice he entered cautiously looking around he had known this office under three of it previous occupant in the day when gilderoy lockhart had lived here it had been plastered in beaming portrait of it owner when lupin had occupied it it wa likely you would meet some fascinating dark creature in a cage or tank if you came to call in the impostor moody day it had been packed with various instrument and artifact for the detection of wrongdoing and concealment now however it looked totally unrecognizable the surface had all been draped in lacy cover and cloth there were several vas full of dried flower page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling each residing on it own doily and on one of the wall wa a collection of ornamental plate each decorated with a large technicolor kitten wearing a different bow around it neck these were so foul that harry stared at them transfixed until professor umbridge spoke again good evening mr potter harry started and looked around he had not noticed her at first because she wa wearing a luridly flowered set of robe that blended only too well with the tablecloth on the desk behind her evening harry said stiffly well sit down she said pointing toward a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up a straightbacked chair a piece of blank parchment lay on the table apparently waiting for him er said harry without moving professor umbridge er before we start ii wanted to ask you a a favor her bulging eye narrowed oh yes well i am i am on the gryffindor quidditch team and i wa supposed to be at the tryout for the new keeper at five of the clock on friday and i wa wa wondering whether i could skip detention that night and do it do it another night instead he knew long before he reached the end of his sentence that it wa no good page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh no said umbridge smiling so widely that she looked a though she had just swallowed a particularly juicy fly oh no no no this is your punishment for spreading evil nasty attention seeking story mr potter and punishment certainly can not be adjusted to suit the guilty one convenience no you will come here at five of the clock tomorrow and the next day and on friday too and you will do your detention a planned i think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do it ought to reinforce the lesson i am trying to teach you harry felt the blood surge to his head and heard a thumping noise in his ear so he told evil nasty attentionseeking story did he she wa watching him with her head slightly to one side still smiling widely a though she knew exactly what he wa thinking and wa waiting to see whether he would start shouting again with a massive effort harry looked away from her dropped his schoolbag beside the straightbacked chair and sat down there said umbridge sweetly were getting better at controlling our temper already are not we now you are going to be doing some line for me mr potter no not with your quill she added a harry bent down to open his bag you are going to be using a rather special one of mine here you are she handed him a long thin black quill with an unusually sharp point i want you to write i must not tell lie she told him softly how many time harry asked with a creditable imitation of politeness page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh a long a it take for the message to sink in said umbridge sweetly off you go she moved over to her desk sat down and bent over a stack of parchment that looked like essay for marking harry raised the sharp black quill and then realized what wa missing you have not given me any ink he said oh you will not need ink said professor umbridge with the merest suggestion of a laugh in her voice harry placed the point of the quill on the paper and wrote i must not tell lie he let out a gasp of pain the word had appeared on the parchment in what appeared to be shining red ink at the same time the word had appeared on the back of harrys right hand cut into his skin a though traced there by a scalpel yet even a he stared at the shining cut the skin healed over again leaving the place where it had been slightly redder than before but quite smooth harry looked around at umbridge she wa watching him her wide toadlike mouth stretched in a smile yes nothing said harry quietly he looked back at the parchment placed the quill upon it once more wrote i must not tell lie and felt the searing pain on the back of his hand for a second time once again the word had been cut into his skin once again they healed over second later page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and on it went again and again harry wrote the word on the parchment in what he soon came to realize wa not ink but his own blood and again and again the word were cut into the back of his hand healed and then reappeared the next time he set quill to parchment darkness fell outside umbridges window harry did not ask when he would be allowed to stop he did not even check his watch he knew she wa watching him for sign of weakness and he wa not going to show any not even if he had to sit here all night cutting open his own hand with this quill come here she said after what seemed hour he stood up his hand wa stinging painfully when he looked down at it he saw that the cut had healed but that the skin there wa red raw hand she said he extended it she took it in her own harry repressed a shudder a she touched him with her thick stubby finger on which she wore a number of ugly old ring tut tut i do not seem to have made much of an impression yet she said smiling well well just have to try again tomorrow evening will not we you may go harry left her office without a word the school wa quite deserted it wa surely past midnight he walked slowly up the corridor then when he had turned the corner and wa sure that she would not hear him broke into a run page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he had not had time to practice vanishing spell had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the bowtruckle nor had he written his essay he skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of madeup dream for divination their first lesson and wa surprised to find a disheveled ron keeping him company how come you did not do it last night harry asked a ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration ron who had been fast asleep when harry got back to the dormitory muttered something about doing other stuff bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few word that will have to do he said slamming the diary shut i have said i dreamed i wa buying a new pair of shoe she can not make anything weird out of that can she they hurried off to north tower together how wa detention with umbridge anyway what did she make you do harry hesitated for a fraction of a second then said line that is not too bad then eh said ron nope said harry hey i forgot did she let you off for friday no said harry ron groaned sympathetically page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa another bad day for harry he wa one of the worst in transfiguration not having practiced vanishing spell at all he had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the bowtruckle and meanwhile professor mcgonagall grubblyplank and sinistra gave them yet more homework which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with umbridge to cap it all angelina johnson tracked him down at dinner again and on learning that he would not be able to attend friday keeper tryout told him she wa not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected player who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitment i am in detention harry yelled after her a she stalked away dyou think id rather be stuck in a room with that old toad or playing quidditch at least it only line said hermione consolingly a harry sank back onto his bench and looked down at his steakandkidney pie which he no longer fancied very much it not a if it a dreadful punishment really harry opened his mouth closed it again and nodded he wa not really sure why he wa not telling ron and hermione exactly what wa happening in umbridge s room he only knew that he did not want to see their look of horror that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face he also felt dimly that this wa between himself and umbridge a private battle of will and he wa not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it i can not believe how much homework we have got said ron miserably page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well why did not you do any last night hermione asked him where were you anyway i wa i fancied a walk said ron shiftily harry had the distinct impression that he wa not alone in concealing thing at the moment k k k the second detention wa just a bad a the previous one the skin on the back of harrys hand became irritated more quickly now red and inflamed harry thought it unlikely to keep healing a effectively for long soon the cut would remain etched in his hand and umbridge would perhaps be satisfied he let no moan of pain escape him however and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal again past midnight he said nothing but good evening and good night his homework situation however wa now desperate and when he returned to the gryffindor common room he did not though exhausted go to bed but opened his book and began snapes moonstone essay it wa halfpast two by the time he had finished it he knew he had done a poor job but there wa no help for it unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with snape next he then dashed off answer to the question professor mcgonagall had set them cobbled together something on the proper handling of bowtruckles for professor grubblyplank and staggered up to bed where he fell fully clothed on top of the bed cover and fell asleep immediately thursday passed in a haze of tiredness ron seemed very sleepy too though harry could not see why he page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling should be harrys third detention passed in the same way a the previous two except that after two hour the word i must not tell lie did not fade from the back of harrys hand but remained scratched there oozing droplet of blood the pause in the pointed quill scratching made professor umbridge look up ah she said softly moving around her desk to examine his hand herself good that ought to serve a a reminder to you ought not it you may leave for tonight do i still have to come back tomorrow said harry picking up his schoolbag with his left hand rather than his smarting right oh yes said professor umbridge smiling widely a before yes i think we can etch the message a little deeper with another evening work he had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than snape but a he walked back toward gryffindor tower he had to admit he had found a contender she is evil he thought a he climbed a staircase to the seventh floor she is an evil twisted mad old ron he had reached the top of the stair turned right and almost walked into ron who wa lurking behind a statue of lachlan the lanky clutching his broomstick he gave a great leap of surprise when he saw harry and attempted to hide his new cleansweep eleven behind his back what are you doing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling er nothing what are you doing harry frowned at him come on you can tell me what are you hiding here for i am i am hiding from fred and george if you must know said ron they just went past with a bunch of first year i bet they are testing stuff on them again i mean they can not do it in the common room now can they not with hermione there he wa talking in a very fast feverish way but what have you got your broom for you have not been flying have you harry asked i well well okay ill tell you but do not laugh all right ron said defensively turning redder with every second ii thought id try out for gryffindor keeper now i have got a decent broom there go on laugh i am not laughing said harry ron blinked it a brilliant idea it would be really cool if you got on the team i have never seen you play keeper are you good i am not bad said ron who looked immensely relieved at harrys reaction charlie fred and george always made me keep for them when they were training during the holiday so you have been practicing tonight every evening since tuesday just on my own though i have been trying to bewitch quaffles to fly at me but it ha not been easy and i do not know how much use it will be ron looked nervous and anxious page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fred and george are going to laugh themselves stupid when i turn up for the tryout they have not stopped taking the mickey out of me since i got made a prefect i wish i wa going to be there said harry bitterly a they set off together toward the common room yeah so do harry what is that on the back of your hand harry who had just scratched his nose with his free right hand tried to hide it but had a much success a ron with his clean weep it just a cut it nothing it but ron had grabbed harrys forearm and pulled the back of harrys hand up level with his eye there wa a pause during which he stared at the word carved into the skin then he released harry looking sick i thought you said she wa giving you line harry hesitated but after all ron had been honest with him so he told ron the truth about the hour he had been spending in umbridges office the old hag ron said in a revolted whisper a they came to a halt in front of the fat lady who wa dozing peacefully with her head against her frame she is sick go to mcgonagall say something no said harry at once i am not giving her the satisfaction of knowing she is got to me got to you you can not let her get away with this page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i do not know how much power mcgonagalls got over her said harry dumbledore then tell dumbledore no said harry flatly why not he got enough on his mind said harry but that wa not the true reason he wa not going to go to dumbledore for help when dumbledore had not spoken to him once since last june well i reckon you should ron began but he wa interrupted by the fat lady who had been watching them sleepily and now burst out are you going to give me the password or will i have to stay awake all night waiting for you to finish your conversation friday dawned sullen and sodden a the rest of the week though harry glanced toward the staff table automatically when he entered the great hall it wa without real hope of seeing hagrid and he turned his mind immediately to his more pressing problem such a the mountainous pile of homework he had to do and the prospect of yet another detention with umbridge two thing sustained harry that day one wa the thought that it wa almost the weekend the other wa that dreadful though his final detention with umbridge wa sure to be he had a distant view of the quidditch pitch from her window and might with luck be able to see something of ron tryout these were rather feeble ray of light it wa true but harry wa grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness he had never had a worse first week of term at hogwarts page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling at five of the clock that evening he knocked on professor umbridges office door for what he sincerely hoped would be the final time wa told to enter and did so the blank parchment lay ready for him on the lace covered table the pointed black quill beside it you know what to do mr potter said umbridge smiling sweetly over at him harry picked up the quill and glanced through the window if he just shifted his chair an inch or so to the right on the pretext of shifting himself closer to the table he managed it he now had a distant view of the gryffindor quidditch team soaring up and down the pitch while half a dozen black figure stood at the foot of the three high goalpost apparently awaiting their turn to keep it wa impossible to tell which one wa ron at this distance i must not tell lie harry wrote the cut in the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh i must not tell lie the cut dug deeper stinging and smarting i must not tell lie blood trickled down his wrist he chanced another glance out of the window whoever wa defending the goalpost now wa doing a very poor job indeed katie bell scored twice in the few second harry dared watch hoping very much that the keeper wa not ron he dropped his eye back to the parchment dotted with blood i must not tell lie i must not tell lie page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he looked up whenever he thought he could risk it when he could hear the scratching of umbridges quill or the opening of a desk drawer the third person to try out wa pretty good the fourth wa terrible the fifth dodged a bludger exceptionally well but then fumbled an easy save the sky wa darkening so that harry doubted he would be able to watch the sixth and seventh people at all i must not tell lie i must not tell lie the parchment wa now shining with drop of blood from the back of his hand which wa searing with pain when he next looked up night had fallen and the quidditch pitch wa no longer visible let u see if you have gotten the message yet shall we said umbridges soft voice half an hour later she moved toward him stretching out her short be ringed finger for his arm and then a she took hold of him to examine the word now cut into his skin pain seared not across the back of his hand but across the scar on his forehead at the same time he had a most peculiar sensation somewhere around his midriff he wrenched his arm out of her grip and leapt to his foot staring at her she looked back at him a smile stretching her wide slack mouth yes it hurt doe not it she said softly he did not answer his heart wa thumping very hard and fast wa she talking about his hand or did she know what he had just felt in his forehead page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well i think i have made my point mr potter you may go he caught up his schoolbag and left the room a quickly a he could stay calm he told himself a he sprinted up the stair stay calm it doe not necessarily mean what you think it mean mimbulus mimbletoniav he gasped at the fat lady who swung forward once more a roar of sound greeted him ron came running toward him beaming all over his face and slopping butterbeer down his front from the goblet he wa clutching harry i did it i am in i am keeper what oh brilliant said harry trying to smile naturally while his heart continued to race and his hand throbbed and bled have a butterbeer ron pressed a bottle onto him i can not believe it where is hermione gone she is there said fred who wa also swigging butterbeer and pointed to an armchair by the fire hermione wa dozing in it her drink tipping precariously in her hand well she said she wa pleased when i told her said ron looking slightly put out let her sleep said george hastily it wa a few moment before harry noticed that several of the first year gathered around them bore unmistakable sign of recent nosebleed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling come here ron and see if oliver old robe fit you called katie bell we can take off his name and put yours on instead a ron moved away angelina came striding up to harry sorry i wa a bit short with you earlier potter she said abruptly it stressful this managing lark you know i am starting to think i wa a bit hard on wood sometimes she wa watching ron over the rim of her goblet with a slight frown on her face look i know he your best mate but he not fabulous she said bluntly i think with a bit of training hell be all right though he come from a family of good quidditch player i am banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today to be honest vicky frobisher and geoffrey hooper both flew better this evening but hoopers a real whiner he always moaning about something or other and vickys involved in all sort of society she admitted herself that if training clashed with her charm club she would put charm first anyway were having a practice session at two of the clock tomorrow so just make sure you are there this time and do me a favor and help ron a much a you can okay he nodded and angelina strolled back to alicia spinnet harry moved over to sit next to hermione who awoke with a jerk a he put down his bag oh harry it you good about ron is not it she said blearily i am just so so so tired she yawned i wa up until one of the clock making more hat they are disappearing like mad page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and sure enough now that he looked harry saw that there were woolly hat concealed all around the room where unwary elf might accidentally pick them up great said harry distractedly if he did not tell somebody soon he would burst listen hermione i wa just up in umbridges office and she touched my arm hermione listened closely when harry had finished she said slowly you are worried that youknow who is controlling her like he controlled quirrell well said harry dropping his voice it a possibility is not it i suppose so said hermione though she sounded unconvinced but i do not think he can be possessing her the way he possessed quirrell i mean he properly alive again now is not he he got his own body he would not need to share someone el he could have her under the imperius curse i suppose harry watched fred george and lee jordan juggling empty butterbeer bottle for a moment then hermione said but last year your scar hurt when nobody wa touching you and did not dumbledore say it had to do with what you know who wa feeling at the time i mean maybe this ha not got anything to do with umbridge at all maybe it just coincidence it happened while you were with her she is evil said harry flatly twisted she is horrible yes but harry i think you ought to tell dumbledore your scar hurt page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa the second time in two day he had been advised to go to dumbledore and his answer to hermione wa just the same a his answer to ron i am not bothering him with this like you just said it not a big deal it been hurting on and off all summer it wa just a bit worse tonight that is all harry i am sure dumbledore would want to be bothered by this yeah said harry before he could stop himself that is the only bit of me dumbledore care about is not it my scar do not say that it not true i think ill write and tell sirius about it see what he think harry you can not put something like that in a letter said hermione looking alarmed do not you remember moody told u to be careful what we put in writing we just can not guarantee owl are not being intercepted anymore all right all right i will not tell him then said harry irritably he got to his foot i am going to bed tell ron for me will you oh no said hermione looking relieved if you are going that mean i can go without being rude too i am absolutely exhausted and i want to make some more hat tomorrow listen you can help me if you like it quite fun i am getting better i can do pattern and bobble and all sort of thing now page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry looked into her face which wa shining with glee and tried to look a though he wa vaguely tempted by this offer er no i do not think i will thanks he said er not tomorrow i have got load of homework to do and he traipsed off to the boy stair leaving her looking slightly disappointed behind him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling percy and padfoot harry wa the first to awake in his dormitory next morning he lay for a moment watching dust swirl in the chink of sunlight falling through the gap in his fourposters hanging and savored the thought that it wa saturday the first week of term seemed to have dragged on forever like one gigantic history of magic lesson judging by the sleepy silence and the freshly minted look of that beam of sunlight it wa just after daybreak he pulled open the curtain around his bed got up and started to dress the only sound apart from the distant twittering of bird wa the slow deep breathing of his fellow gryffindors he opened his schoolbag carefully pulled out parchment and quill and headed out of the dormitory for the common room making straight for his favorite squashy old armchair beside the now extinct fire harry settled himself down comfortably and unrolled his parchment while looking around the room the detritus of crumpledup page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling bit of parchment old gobstones empty ingredient jar and candy wrapper that usually covered the common room at the end of each day wa gone a were all hermiones elf hat wondering vaguely how many elf had now been set free whether they wanted to be or not harry uncorked his ink bottle dipped his quill into it and then held it suspended an inch above the smooth yellowish surface of his parchment thinking hard but after a minute or so he found himself staring into the empty grate at a complete loss for what to say he could now appreciate how hard it had been for ron and hermione to write him letter over the summer how wa he supposed to tell sirius everything that had happened over the past week and pose all the question he wa burning to ask without giving potential letterthieves a lot of information he did not want them to have he sat quite motionless for a while gazing into the fireplace then finally coming to a decision he dipped his quill into the ink bottle once more and set it resolutely upon the parchment dear snuffle hope you are okay the first week back here is been terrible i am really glad it the weekend we have got a new defense against the dark art teacher professor umbridge she is nearly a nice a your mum i am writing because that thing i wrote to you about last summer happened again last night when i wa doing a detention with umbridge were all missing our biggest friend we hope hell be back soon page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling please write back quickly best harry harry reread this letter several time trying to see it from the point of view of an outsider he could not see how they would know what he wa talking about or who he wa talking to just from reading this letter he did hope sirius would pick up the hint about hagrid and tell them when he might be back harry did not want to ask directly in case it drew too much attention to what hagrid might be up to while he wa not at hogwarts considering it wa a very short letter it had taken a long time to write sunlight had crept halfway across the room while he had been working on it and he could now hear distant sound of movement from the dormitory above sealing the parchment carefully he climbed through the portrait hole and headed off for the owlery i would not go that way if i were you said nearly headless nick drifting disconcertingly through a wall just ahead of him a he walked down the passage peeve is planning an amusing joke on the next person to pas the bust of paracelsus halfway down the corridor doe it involve paracelsus falling on top of the person head asked harry funnily enough it doe said nearly headless nick in a bored voice subtlety ha never been peeve s strong point i am off to try and find the bloody baron he might be able to put a stop to it see you harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah bye said harry and instead of turning right he turned left taking a longer but safer route up to the owlery his spirit rose a he walked past window after window showing brilliantly blue sky he had training later he would be back on the quidditch pitch at last something brushed his ankle he looked down and saw the caretaker skeletal gray cat mr norris slinking past him she turned lamplike yellow eye upon him for a moment before disappearing behind a statue of wilfred the wistful i am not doing anything wrong harry called after her she had the unmistakable air of a cat that wa off to report to her bos yet harry could not see why he wa perfectly entitled to walk up to the owlery on a saturday morning the sun wa high in the sky now and when harry entered the owlery the glassless window dazzled his eye thick silvery beam of sunlight crisscrossed the circular room in which hundred of owl nestled on rafter a little restless in the early morning light some clearly just returned from hunting the straw covered floor crunched a little a he stepped across tiny animal bone craning his neck for a sight of hedwig there you are he said spotting her somewhere near the very top of the vaulted ceiling get down here i have got a letter for you with a low hoot she stretched her great white wing and soared down onto his shoulder right i know this say snuffle on the outside he told her giving her the letter to clasp in her beak and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling without knowing exactly why whispering but it for sirius okay she blinked her amber eye once and he took that to mean that she understood safe flight then said harry and he carried her to one of the window with a moment pressure on his arm hedwig took off into the blindingly bright sky he watched her until she became a tiny black speck and vanished then switched his gaze to hagrids hut clearly visible from this window and just a clearly uninhabited the chimney smokeless the curtain drawn the treetop of the forbidden forest swayed in a light breeze harry watched them savoring the fresh air on his face thinking about quidditch later and then he saw it a great reptilian winged horse just like the one pulling the hogwarts carriage with leathery black wing spread wide like a pterodactyl rose up out of the tree like a grotesque giant bird it soared in a great circle and then plunged once more into the tree the whole thing had happened so quickly harry could hardly believe what he had seen except that his heart wa hammering madly the owlery door opened behind him he leapt in shock and turning quickly saw cho chang holding a letter and a parcel in her hand hi said harry automatically oh hi she said breathlessly i did not think anyone would be up here this early i only remembered five minute ago it my mum birthday she held up the parcel page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling right said harry his brain seemed to have jammed he wanted to say something funny and interesting but the memory of that terrible winged horse wa fresh in his mind nice day he said gesturing to the window his inside seemed to shrivel with embarrassment the weather he wa talking about the weather yeah said cho looking around for a suitable owl good quidditch condition i have not been out all week have you no said harry cho had selected one of the school barn owl she coaxed it down onto her arm where it held out an obliging leg so that she could attach the parcel hey ha gryffindor got a new keeper yet she asked yeah said harry it my friend ron weasley dyou know him the tornadohater said cho rather coolly is he any good yeah said harry i think so i did not see his tryout though i wa in detention cho looked up the parcel only halfattached to the owl leg that umbridge woman foul she said in a low voice putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how how how he died everyone heard about it it wa all over the school you were really brave standing up to her like that page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harrys inside reinflated so rapidly he felt a though he might actually float a few inch off the dropping strewn floor who cared about a stupid flying horse cho thought he had been really brave for a moment he considered accidentallyonpurpose showing her his cut hand a he helped her tie her parcel onto her owl but the very instant that this thrilling thought occurred the owlery door opened again filch the caretaker came wheezing into the room there were purple patch on his sunken veined cheek his jowl were aquiver and his thin gray hair disheveled he had obviously run here mr norris came trotting at his heel gazing up at the owl overhead and mewing hungrily there wa a restless shifting of wing from above and a large brown owl snapped his beak in a menacing fashion aha said filch taking a flatfooted step toward harry his pouchy cheek trembling with anger i have had a tipoff that you are intending to place a massive order for dungbombs harry folded his arm and stared at the caretaker who told you i wa ordering dungbombs cho wa looking from harry to filch also frowning the barn owl on her arm tired of standing on one leg gave an admonitory hoot but she ignored it i have my source said filch in a selfsatisfied hiss now hand over whatever it is you are sending feeling immensely thankful that he had not dawdled in posting off the letter harry said i can not it gone gone said filch his face contorting with rage page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling gone said harry calmly filch opened his mouth furiously mouthed for a few second then raked harrys robe with his eye how do i know you have not got it in your pocket because i saw him send it said cho angrily filch rounded on her you saw him that is right i saw him she said fiercely there wa a moment pause in which filch glared at cho and cho glared right back then the caretaker turned and shuffled back toward the door he stopped with his hand on the handle and looked back at harry if i get so much a a whiff of a dungbomb he stumped off down the stair mr norris cast a last longing look at the owl and followed him harry and cho looked at each other thanks harry said no problem said cho finally fixing the parcel to the barn owl other leg her face slightly pink you were not ordering dungbombs were you no said harry i wonder why he thought you were then she said a she carried the owl to the window page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry shrugged he wa quite a mystified by that a she wa though oddly it wa not bothering him very much at the moment they left the owlery together at the entrance of a corridor that led toward the west wing of the castle cho said i am going this way well ill ill see you around harry yeah see you she smiled at him and departed he walked on feeling quietly elated he had managed to have an entire conversation with her and not embarrassed himself once you were really brave standing up to her like that she had called him brave she did not hate him for being alive of course she had preferred cedric he knew that though if he would only asked her to the ball before cedric had thing might have turned out differently she had seemed sincerely sorry that she had to refuse when harry had asked her morning harry said brightly to ron and hermione joining them at the gryffindor table in the great hall what are you looking so pleased about said ron eyeing harry in surprise erm quidditch later said harry happily pulling a large platter of bacon and egg toward him oh yeah said ron he put down the bit of toast he wa eating and took a large swig of pumpkin juice then he said listen you do not fancy going out a bit earlier with me do you just to er give me some practice before training so i can you know get my eye in a bit page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah okay said harry look i do not think you should said hermione seriously you are both really behind on homework a it but she broke off the morning post wa arriving and a usual the daily prophet wa soaring toward her in the beak of a screech owl which landed perilously close to the sugar bowl and held out a leg hermione pushed a knut into it leather pouch took the newspaper and scanned the front page critically a the owl took off again anything interesting said ron harry smiled he knew ron wa keen to get her off the subject of homework no she sighed just some guff about the bass player in the weird sister getting married she opened the paper and disappeared behind it harry devoted himself to another helping of egg and bacon ron wa staring up at the high window looking slightly preoccupied wait a moment said hermione suddenly oh no sirius what is happened said harry and he snatched at the paper so violently that it ripped down the middle so that he and hermione were holding half each the ministry of magic ha received a tipoff from a reliable source that sirius black notorious mass murderer blah blah blah is currently hiding in london hermione read from her half in an anguished whisper page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling lucius malfoy ill bet anything said harry in a low furious voice he did recognize sirius on the platform what said ron looking alarmed you did not say shh said the other two ministry warns wizarding community that black is very dangerous killed thirteen people broke out of azkaban the usual rubbish hermione concluded laying down her half of the paper and looking fearfully at harry and ron well he just will not be able to leave the house again that is all she whispered dumbledore did warn him not to harry looked down glumly at the bit of the prophet he had torn off most of the page wa devoted to an advertisement for madame malkins robe for all occasion which wa apparently having a sale hey he said flattening it down so hermione and ron could both see it look at this i have got all the robe i want said ron no said harry look this little piece here ron and hermione bent closer to read it the item wa barely an inch long and placed right at the bottom of a column it wa headlined trespass at ministry sturgis podmore of number two laburnum garden clapham ha appeared in front of the wizengamot charged with trespass and attempted robbery at the ministry of magic on st august page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling podmore wa arrested by ministry of magic watch wizard eric munch who found him attempting to force his way through a topsecurity door at one of the clock in the morning podmore who refused to speak in his own defense wa convicted on both charge and sentenced to six month in azkaban sturgis podmore said ron slowly but he that bloke who look like his head been thatched is not he he one of the ord ron shh said hermione casting a terrified look around them six month in azkaban whispered harry shocked just for trying to get through a door do not be silly it wa not just for trying to get through a door what on earth wa he doing at the ministry of magic at one of the clock in the morning breathed hermione dyou reckon he wa doing something for the order ron muttered wait a moment said harry slowly sturgis wa supposed to come and see u off remember the other two looked at him yeah he wa supposed to be part of our guard going to king cross remember and moody wa all annoyed because he did not turn up so that doe not seem like he wa supposed to be on a iob for them doe it well maybe they did not expect him to get caught said hermione page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it could be a frameup ron exclaimed excitedly no listen he went on dropping his voice dramatically at the threatening look on hermiones face the ministry suspect he one of dumbledores lot so i do not know they lured him to the ministry and he wa not trying to get through a door at all maybe they have just made something up to get him there wa a pause while harry and hermione considered this harry thought it seemed farfetched hermione on the other hand looked rather impressed and said do you know i would not be at all surprised if that were true she folded up her half of the newspaper thoughtfully when harry laid down his knife and fork she seemed to come out of a reverie right well i think we should tackle that essay for sprout on selffertilizing shrub first and if were lucky well be able to start mcgonagalls inanimatus conjurus before lunch harry felt a small twinge of guilt at the thought of the pile of homework awaiting him upstairs but the sky wa a clear exhilarating blue and he had not been on his firebolt for a week i mean we can do it tonight said ron a he and harry walked down the sloping lawn toward the quidditch pitch their broomstick over their shoulder hermiones dire warning that they would fail all their owl still ringing in their ear and we have got tomorrow she get too worked up about work that is her trouble there wa a pause and he added in a slightly more anxious tone dyou think she meant it when she said we were not copying from her page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah i do said harry still this is important too we have got to practice if we want to stay on the quidditch team yeah that is right said ron in a heartened tone and we have got plenty of time to do it all harry glanced over to his right a they approached the quidditch pitch to where the tree of the forbidden forest were swaying darkly nothing flew out of them the sky wa empty but for a few distant owl fluttering around the owlery tower he had enough to worry about the flying horse wa not doing him any harm he pushed it out of his mind they collected ball from the cupboard in the changing room and set to work ron guarding the three tall goalpost harry playing chaser and trying to get the quaffle past ron harry thought ron wa pretty good he blocked threequarters of the goal harry attempted to put past him and played better the longer they practiced after a couple of hour they returned to the school where they ate lunch during which hermione made it quite clear that she thought they were irresponsible then returned to the quidditch pitch for the real training session all their teammate but angelina were already in the changing room when they entered all right ron said george winking at him yeah said ron who had become quieter and quieter all the way down to the pitch ready to show u all up ickle prefect said fred emerging touslehaired from the neck of his quidditch robe a slightly malicious grin on his face page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling shut up said ron stonyfaced pulling on his own team robe for the first time they fitted him well considering they had been oliver wood who wa rather broader in the shoulder okay everyone said angelina entering from the captain office already changed let u get to it alicia and fred if you can just bring the ball crate out for u oh and there are a couple of people out there watching but i want you to just ignore them all right something in her wouldbe casual voice made harry think he might know who the uninvited spectator were and sure enough when they left the changing room for the bright sunlight of the pitch it wa to a storm of catcall and jeer from the slytherin quidditch team and assorted hangerson who were grouped halfway up the empty stand and whose voice echoed loudly around the stadium what is that weasleys riding malfoy called in his sneering drawl why would anyone put a flying charm on a moldy old log like that crabbe goyle and pansy parkinson guffawed and shrieked with laughter ron mounted his broom and kicked off from the ground and harry followed him watching his ear turn red from behind ignore them he said accelerating to catch up with ron well see who is laughing after we play them exactly the attitude i want harry said angelina approvingly soaring around them with the quaffle under her arm and slowing to hover on the spot in front of her airborne team okay everyone were going to start with some pass just to warm up the whole team please page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hey johnson what is with that hairstyle anyway shrieked pansy parkinson from below why would anyone want to look like they have got worm coming out of their head angelina swept her long braided hair out of her face and said calmly spread out then and let u see what we can do harry reversed away from the others to the far side of the pitch ron fell back toward the opposite goal angelina raised the quaffle with one hand and threw it hard to fred who passed to george who passed to harry who passed to ron who dropped it the slytherins led by malfoy roared and screamed with laughter ron who had pelted toward the ground to catch the quaffle before it landed pulled out of the dive untidily so that he slipped sideways on his broom and returned to playing height blushing harry saw fred and george exchange look but uncharacteristically neither of them said anything for which he wa grateful pas it on ron called angelina a though nothing had happened ron threw the quaffle to alicia who passed back to harry who passed to george hey potter how is your scar feeling called malfoy sure you do not need a liedown it must be what a whole week since you were in the hospital wing that is a record for you is not it fred passed to angelina she reverse passed to harry who had not been expecting it but caught it in the very tip of his finger and passed it quickly to ron who lunged for it and missed by inch page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling come on now ron said angelina crossly a ron dived for the ground again chasing the quaffle pay attention it would have been hard to say whether ron face or the quaffle wa a deeper scarlet when he returned again to playing height malfoy and the rest of the slytherin team were howling with laughter on his third attempt ron caught the quaffle perhaps out of relief he passed it on so enthusiastically that it soared straight through katies outstretched hand and hit her hard in the face sorry ron groaned zooming forward to see whether he had done any damage get back in position she is fine barked angelina but a you are passing to a teammate do try not to knock her off her broom will not you we have got bludgers for that katies nose wa bleeding down below the slytherins were stamping their foot and jeering fred and george converged on katie here take this fred told her handing her something small and purple from out of his pocket it will clear it up in no time all right called angelina fred george go and get your bat and a bludger ron get up to the goalpost harry release the snitch when i say so were going to aim for ron goal obviously harry zoomed off after the twin to fetch the snitch ron making a right pig ear of thing is not he muttered george a the three of them landed at the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling crate containing the ball and opened it to extract one of the bludgers and the snitch he just nervous said harry he wa fine when i wa practicing with him this morning yeah well i hope he ha not peaked too soon said fred gloomily they returned to the air when angelina blew her whistle harry released the snitch and fred and george let fly the bludger from that moment on harry wa barely aware of what the others were doing it wa his job to recapture the tiny fluttering golden ball that wa worth a hundred and fifty point to the seeker team and doing so required enormous speed and skill he accelerated rolling and swerving in and out of the chaser the warm autumn air whipping his face and the distant yell of the slytherins so much meaningless roaring in his ear but too soon the whistle brought him to a halt again stop stop stop screamed angelina ron you are not covering your middle post harry looked around at ron who wa hovering in front of the lefthand hoop leaving the other two completely unprotected oh sorry you keep shifting around while you are watching the chaser said angelina either stay in center position until you have to move to defend a hoop or else circle the hoop but do not drift vaguely off to one side that is how you let in the last three goal sorry ron repeated his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and katie can not you do something about that nosebleed it just getting worse said katie thickly attempting to stem the flow with her sleeve harry glanced around at fred who wa looking anxious and checking his pocket he saw fred pull out something purple examine it for a second and then look around at katie evidently horrorstruck well let u try again said angelina she wa ignoring the slytherins who had now set up a chant of gryffindor are loser gryffindor are loser but there wa a certain rigidity about her seat on the broom nevertheless this time they had been flying for barely three minute when angelinas whistle sounded harry who had just sighted the snitch circling the opposite goalpost pulled up feeling distinctly aggrieved what now he said impatiently to alicia who wa nearest katie she said shortly harry turned and saw angelina fred and george all flying a fast a they could toward katie harry and alicia sped toward her too it wa plain that angelina had stopped training just in time katie wa now chalk white and covered in blood she need the hospital wing said angelina well take her said fred she er might have swallowed a blood blisterpod by mistake page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well there is no point continuing with no beater and a chaser gone said angelina glumly a fred and george zoomed off toward the castle supporting katie between them come on let u go and get changed the slytherins continued to chant a they trailed back into the changing room how wa practice asked hermione rather coolly half an hour later a harry and ron climbed through the portrait hole into the gryffindor common room it wa harry began completely lousy said ron in a hollow voice sinking into a chair beside hermione she looked up at ron and her frostiness seemed to melt well it wa only your first one she said consolingly it bound to take time to who said it wa me who made it lousy snapped ron no one said hermione looking taken aback i thought you thought i wa bound to be rubbish no of course i did not look you said it wa lousy so i just i am going to get started on some homework said ron angrily and stomped off to the staircase to the boy dormitory and vanished from sight hermione turned to harry wa he lousy page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no said harry loyally hermione raised her eyebrow well i suppose he could have played better harry muttered but it wa only the first training session like you said neither harry nor ron seemed to make much headway with their homework that night harry knew ron wa too preoccupied with how badly he had performed at quidditch practice and he himself wa having difficulty in getting the chant of gryffindor are loser out of his head they spent the whole of sunday in the common room buried in their book while the room around them filled up then emptied it wa another clear fine day and most of their fellow gryffindors spent the day out in the ground enjoying what might well be some of the last sunshine that year by the evening harry felt a though somebody had been beating his brain against the inside of his skull you know we probably should try and get more homework done during the week harry muttered to ron a they finally laid aside professor mcgonagalls long essay on the inanimatus conjurus spell and turned miserably to professor sinistra s equally long and difficult essay about jupiter moon yeah said ron rubbing slightly bloodshot eye and throwing his fifth spoiled bit of parchment into the fire beside them listen shall we just ask hermione if we can have a look at what she is done harry glanced over at her she wa sitting with crookshanks on her lap and chatting merrily to ginny a a pair of knitting needle flashed in midair page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling in front of her now knitting a pair of shapeless elf sock no he said heavily you know she will not let u and so they worked on while the sky outside the window became steadily darker slowly the crowd in the common room began to thin again at halfpast eleven hermione wandered over to them yawning nearly done no said ron shortly jupiter biggest moon is ganymede not callisto she said pointing over ron shoulder at a line in his astronomy essay and it io that is got the volcano thanks snarled ron scratching out the offending sentence sorry i only yeah well if you have just come over here to criticize ron i have not got time to listen to a sermon all right hermione i am up to my neck in it here no look hermione wa pointing to the nearest window harry and ron both looked over a handsome screech owl wa standing on the windowsill gazing into the room at ron page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling is not that hermes said hermione sounding amazed blimey it is said ron quietly throwing down his quill and getting to his foot what is percy writing to me for he crossed to the window and opened it hermes flew inside landed upon ron essay and held out a leg to which a letter wa attached ron took it off and the owl departed at once leaving inky footprint across ron drawing of the moon io that is definitely percy handwriting said ron sinking back into his chair and staring at the word on the outside of the scroll to ronald weasley gryffindor house hogwarts he looked up at the other two what dyou reckon open it said hermione eagerly harry nodded ron unrolled the scroll and began to read the farther down the parchment his eye traveled the more pronounced became his scowl when he had finished reading he looked disgusted he thrust the letter at harry and hermione who leaned toward each other to read it together dear ron i have only just heard from no le a person than the minister of magic himself who ha it from your new teacher professor umbridge that you have become a hogwarts prefect i wa most pleasantly surprised when i heard this news and must firstly offer my congratulation i must admit that i have always been afraid that you would take what we might call the fred and george route page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling rather than following in my footstep so you can imagine my feeling on hearing you have stopped flouting authority and have decided to shoulder some real responsibility but i want to give you more than congratulation ron i want to give you some advice which is why i am sending this at night rather than by the usual morning post hopefully you will be able to read this away from prying eye and avoid awkward question from something the minister let slip when telling me you are now a prefect i gather that you are still seeing a lot of harry potter i must tell you ron that nothing could put you in danger of losing your badge more than continued fraternization with that boy yes i am sure you are surprised to hear this no doubt you will say that potter ha always been dumbledores favorite but i feel bound to tell you that dumbledore may not be in charge at hogwarts much longer and the people who count have a very different and probably more accurate view of potter behavior i shall say no more here but if you look at the daily prophet tomorrow you will get a good idea of the way the wind is blowing and see if you can spot yours truly seriously ron you do not want to be tarred with the same brush a potter it could be very damaging to your future prospect and i am talking here about life after school too a you must be aware given that our father escorted him to court potter had a disciplinary hearing this summer in front of the whole wizengamot and he did not come out of it looking too good he got off on a mere technicality if you ask me and many of the people i have spoken to remain convinced of his guilt it may be that you are afraid to sever tie with potter i know that he can be unbalanced and for all i know violent but if you have any worry about this page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling or have spotted anything else in potter behavior that is troubling you i urge you to speak to dolores umbridge a really delightful woman who i know will be only too happy to advise you this lead me to my other bit of advice a i have hinted above dumbledores regime at hog wart may soon be over your loyalty ron should be not to him but to the school and the ministry i am very sorry to hear that so far professor umbridge is encountering very little cooperation from staff a she strives to make those necessary change within hogwarts that the ministry so ardently desire although she should find this easier from next week again see the prophet tomorrow i shall say only this a student who show himself willing to help professor umbridge now may be very well placed for head boy ship in a couple of year i am sorry that i wa unable to see more of you over the summer it pain me to criticize our parent but i am afraid i can no longer live under their roof while they remain mixed up with the dangerous crowd around dumbledore if you are writing to mother at any point you might tell her that a certain sturgis podmore who is a great friend of dumbledores ha recently been sent to azkaban for trespass at the ministry perhaps that will open their eye to the kind of petty criminal with whom they are currently rubbing shoulder i count myself very lucky to have escaped the stigma of association with such people the minister really could not be more gracious to me and i do hope ron that you will not allow family tie to blind you to the misguided nature of our parent belief and action either i sincerely hope that in time they will realize how mistaken they were and i shall of course be ready to accept a full apology when that day come page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling please think over what i have said most carefully particularly the bit about harry potter and congratulation again on becoming prefect your brother percy harry looked up at ron well he said trying to sound a though he found the whole thing a joke if you want to er what is it he checked percy letter oh yeah sever tie with me i swear i will not get violent give it back said ron holding out his hand he is ron said jerkily tearing percy letter in half the world he tore it into quarter biggest he tore it into eighth git he threw the piece into the fire come on we have got to get this finished some time before dawn he said briskly to harry pulling professor sinistra s essay back toward him hermione wa looking at ron with an odd expression on her face oh give them here she said abruptly what said ron give them to me ill look through them and correct them she said are you serious ah hermione you are a lifesaver said ron what can i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what you can say is we promise well never leave our homework this late again she said holding out both hand for their essay but she looked slightly amused all the same thanks a million hermione said harry weakly passing over his essay and sinking back into his armchair rubbing his eye it wa now past midnight and the common room wa deserted but for the three of them and crookshanks the only sound wa that of hermiones quill scratching out sentence here and there on their essay and the ruffle of page a she checked various fact in the reference book strewn across the table harry wa exhausted he also felt an odd sick empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire he knew that half the people inside hogwarts thought him strange even mad he knew that the daily prophet had been making snide allusion to him for month but there wa something about seeing it written down like that in percy writing about knowing that percy wa advising ron to drop him and even to tell tale on him to umbridge that made his situation real to him a nothing else had he had known percy for four year had stayed in his house during the summer shared a tent with him during the quidditch world cup had even been awarded full mark by him in the second task of the triwizard tournament last year yet now percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent and with a surge of sympathy for his godfather harry thought that sirius wa probably the only person he knew who could really understand how he felt at the moment because sirius wa in the same situation page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling nearly everyone in the wizarding world thought sirius a dangerous murderer and a great voldemort supporter and he had had to live with that knowledge for fourteen year harry blinked he had just seen something in the fire that could not have been there it had flashed into sight and vanished immediately no it could not have been he had imagined it because he had been thinking about sirius okay write that down hermione said to ron pushing his essay and a sheet covered in her own writing back to ron and then copy out this conclusion that i have written for you hermione you are honestly the most wonderful person i have ever met said ron weakly and if i am ever rude to you again ill know you are back to normal said hermione harry yours is okay except for this bit at the end i think you must have misheard professor sinistra europa covered in ice not mouse harry harry had slid off his chair onto his knee and wa now crouching on the singed and threadbare hearthrug gazing into the flame er harry said ron uncertainly why are you down there because i have just seen sirius head in the fire said harry he spoke quite calmly after all he had seen sirius head in this very fire the previous year and talked to it too nevertheless he could not be sure that he had really seen it this time it had vanished so quickly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sirius head hermione repeated you mean like when he wanted to talk to you during the triwizard tournament but he would not do that now it would be too siriusl she gasped gazing at the fire ron dropped his quill there in the middle of the dancing flame sat sirius head long dark hair falling around his grinning face i wa starting to think you would go to bed before everyone else had disappeared he said i have been checking every hour you have been popping into the fire every hour harry said half laughing just for a few second to check if the coast wa clear yet but what if you would been seen said hermione anxiously well i think a girl first year by the look of her might have got a glimpse of me earlier but do not worry sirius said hastily a hermione clapped a hand to her mouth i wa gone the moment she looked back at me and ill bet she just thought i wa an oddly shaped log or something but sirius this is taking an awful risk hermione began you sound like molly said sirius this wa the only way i could come up with of answering harrys letter without resorting to a code and code are breakable at the mention of harrys letter hermione and ron had both turned to stare at him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you did not say you would written to sirius said hermione accusingly i forgot said harry which wa perfectly true his meeting with cho in the owlery had driven everything before it out of his mind do not look at me like that hermione there wa no way anyone would have got secret information out of it wa there sirius no it wa very good said sirius smiling anyway wed better be quick just in case were disturbed your scar what about ron began but hermione said quickly well tell you afterward go on sirius well i know it can not be fun when it hurt but we do not think it anything to really worry about it kept aching all last year did not it yeah and dumbledore said it happened whenever voldemort wa feeling a powerful emotion said harry ignoring a usual ron and hermione s wince so maybe he wa just i do not know really angry or something the night i had that detention well now he back it bound to hurt more often said sirius so you do not think it had anything to do with umbridge touching me when i wa in detention with her harry asked i doubt it said sirius i know her by reputation and i am sure she is no death eater she is foul enough to be one said harry darkly and ron and hermione nodded vigorously in agreement page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes but the world is not split into good people and death eater said sirius with a wry smile i know she is a nasty piece of work though you should hear remus talk about her doe lupin know her asked harry quickly remembering umbridges comment about dangerous halfbreeds during her first lesson no said sirius but she drafted a bit of anti werewolf legislation two year ago that make it almost impossible for him to get a job harry remembered how much shabbier lupin looked these day and his dislike of umbridge deepened even further what is she got against werewolf said hermione angrily scared of them i expect said sirius smiling at her indignation apparently she loathes parthumans she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too imagine wasting your time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like kreacher on the loose ron laughed but hermione looked upset sirius she said reproachfully honestly if you made a bit of an effort with kreacher i am sure he would respond after all you are the only member of his family he got left and professor dumbledore said so what are umbridges lesson like sirius interrupted is she training you all to kill half breed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no said harry ignoring hermiones affronted look at being cut off in her defense of kreacher she is not letting u use magic at all all we do is read the stupid textbook said ron ah well that figure said sirius our information from inside the ministry is that fudge doe not want you trained in combat trained in combat repeated harry incredulously what doe he think were doing here forming some sort of wizard army that is exactly what he think you are doing said sirius or rather that is exactly what he afraid dumbledores doing forming his own private army with which he will be able to take on the ministry of magic there wa a pause at this then ron said that is the stupidest thing i have ever heard including all the stuff that luna lovegood come out with so were being prevented from learning defense against the dark art because fudge is scared well use spell against the ministry said hermione looking furious yep said sirius fudge think dumbledore will stop at nothing to seize power he getting more paranoid about dumbledore by the day it a matter of time before he ha dumbledore arrested on some trumpedup charge this reminded harry of percy letter page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dyou know if there is going to be anything about dumbledore in the daily prophet tomorrow only ron brother percy reckons there will be i do not know said sirius i have not seen anyone from the order all weekend they are all busy it just been kreacher and me here there wa a definite note of bitterness in sirius voice so you have not had any news about hagrid either ah said sirius well he wa supposed to be back by now no one sure what is happened to him then seeing their stricken face he added quickly but dumbledores not worried so do not you three get yourselves in a state i am sure hagrids fine but if he wa supposed to be back by now said hermione in a small worried voice madame maxime wa with him we have been in touch with her and she say they got separated on the journey home but there is nothing to suggest he hurt or well nothing to suggest he not perfectly okay unconvinced harry ron and hermione exchanged worried look listen do not go asking too many question about hagrid said sirius hastily it will just draw even more attention to the fact that he not back and i know dumbledore doe not want that hagrids tough hell be okay and when they did not appear cheered by this sirius added when is your next hogsmeade weekend anyway i wa thinking we got away with page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the dog disguise at the station did not we i thought i could no said harry and hermione together very loudly sirius did not you see the daily prophet said hermione anxiously oh that said sirius grinning they are always guessing where i am they have not really got a clue yeah but we think this time they have said harry something malfoy said on the train made u think he knew it wa you and his father wa on the platform sirius you know lucius malfoy so do not come up here whatever you do if malfoy recognizes you again all right all right i have got the point said sirius he looked most displeased just an idea thought you might like to get together i would i just do not want you chucked back in azkaban said harry there wa a pause in which sirius looked out of the fire at harry a crease between his sunken eye you are le like your father than i thought he said finally a definite coolness in his voice the risk would have been what made it fun for james look well id better get going i can hear kreacher coming down the stair said sirius but harry wa sure he wa lying ill write to tell you a time i can make it back into the fire then shall i if you can stand to risk it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there wa a tiny pop and the place where sirius head had been wa flickering flame once more page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the hogwarts high inquisitor they had expected to have to comb hermiones daily prophet carefully next morning to find the article percy had mentioned in his letter however the departing delivery owl had barely cleared the top of the milk jug when hermione let out a huge gasp and flattened the newspaper to reveal a large photograph of dolores umbridge smiling widely and blinking slowly at them from beneath the headline ministry seek educational reform dolores umbridge appointed firstever high inquisitor high inquisitor said harry darkly his halfeaten bit of toast slipping from his finger what doe that mean hermione read aloud in a surprise move last night the ministry of magic passed new legislation giving itself an unprecedented page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling level of control at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the minister ha been growing uneasy about going on at hogwarts for some time said junior assistant to the minister percy weasley he is now responding to concern voiced by anxious parent who feel the school may be moving in a direction they do not approve this is not the first time in recent week fudge ha used new law to effect improvement at the wizarding school a recently a august th educational decree twenty two wa passed to ensure that in the event of the current headmaster being unable to provide a candidate for a teaching post the ministry should select an appropriate person that is how dolores umbridge came to be appointed to the teaching staff at hogwarts said weasley last night dumbledore could not find anyone so the minister put in umbridge and of course she is been an immediate success she is been a what said harry loudly wait there is more said hermione grimly an immediate success totally revolutionizing the teaching of defense against the dark art and providing the minister with ontheground feedback about what is really happening at hogwarts it is this last function that the ministry ha now formalized with the passing of educational decree twentythree which creates the new position of hogwarts high inquisitor page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling this is an exciting new phase in the minister plan to get to grip with what some are calling the falling standard at hog wart said weasley the inquisitor will have power to inspect her fellow educator and make sure that they are coming up to scratch professor umbridge ha been offered this position in addition to her own teaching post and we are delighted to say that she ha accepted the ministry new move have received enthusiastic support from parent of student at hogwarts i feel much easier in my mind now that i know that dumbledore is being subjected to fair and objective evaluation said mr lucius malfoy speaking from his wiltshire mansion last night many of u with our childrens best interest at heart have been concerned about some of dumbledores eccentric decision in the last few year and will be glad to know that the ministry is keeping an eye on the situation among those eccentric decision are undoubtedly the controversial staff appointment previously described in this newspaper which have included the hiring of werewolf remus lupin half giant rubeus hagrid and delusional exauror madeye moody rumor abound of course that albus dumbledore once supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizard and chief warlock of the wizengamot is no longer up to the task of managing the prestigious school of hogwarts i think the appointment of the inquisitor is a first step toward ensuring that hogwarts ha a headmaster in whom we can all repose confidence said a ministry insider last night page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wizengamot elder gris elda m archbanks and tiberius ogden have resigned in protest at the introduction of the post of inquisitor to hogwarts hogwarts is a school not an outpost of cornelius fudge office said madam marchbanks this is a further disgusting attempt to discredit albus dumbledore for a full account of madam marchbanks alleged link to subversive goblin group turn to page hermione finished reading and looked across the table at the other two so now we know how we ended up with umbridge fudge passed this educational decree and forced her on u and now he given her the power to inspect other teacher hermione wa breathing fast and her eye were very bright i can not believe this it outrageous i know it is said harry he looked down at his right hand clenched upon the tabletop and saw the faint white outline of the word umbridge had forced him to cut into his skin but a grin wa unfurling on ron face what said harry and hermione together staring at him oh i can not wait to see mcgonagall inspected said ron happily umbridge will not know what is hit her well come on said hermione jumping up wed better get going if she is inspecting binnss class we do not want to be late page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but professor umbridge wa not inspecting their history of magic lesson which wa just a dull a the previous monday nor wa she in snapes dungeon when they arrived for double potion where harrys moonstone essay wa handed back to him with a large spiky black d scrawled in an upper corner i have awarded you the grade you would have received if you presented this work in your owl said snape with a smirk a he swept among them passing back their homework this should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination snape reached the front of the class and turned to face them the general standard of this homework wa abysmal most of you would have failed had this been your examination i expect to see a great deal more effort for this week essay on the various variety of venom antidote or i shall have to start handing out detention to those dunce who get d he smirked a malfoy sniggered and said in a carrying whisper some people got d ha harry realized that hermione wa looking sideways to see what grade he had received he slid his moonstone essay back into his bag a quickly a possible feeling that he would rather keep that information private determined not to give snape an excuse to fail him this lesson harry read and reread every line of the instruction on the blackboard at least three time before acting on them his strengthening solution wa not precisely the clear turquoise shade of hermione s but it wa at least blue rather than pink like nevilles and he delivered a flask of it to snapes page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling desk at the end of the lesson with a feeling of mingled defiance and relief well that wa not a bad a last week wa it said hermione a they climbed the step out of the dungeon and made their way across the entrance hall toward lunch and the homework did not go too badly either did it when neither ron nor harry answered she pressed on i mean all right i did not expect the top grade not if he marking to owl standard but a pas is quite encouraging at this stage would not you say harry made a noncommittal noise in his throat of course a lot can happen between now and the exam we have got plenty of time to improve but the grade were getting now are a sort of baseline are not they something we can build on they sat down together at the gryffindor table obviously id have been thrilled if id gotten an o hermione said ron sharply if you want to know what grade we got ask i do not i did not mean well if you want to tell me i got a p said ron ladling soup into his bowl happy well that is nothing to be ashamed of said fred who had just arrived at the table with george and lee jordan and wa sitting down on harrys right nothing wrong with a good healthy p page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but said hermione doe not p stand for boor yeah said lee jordan still better than d is not it dreadful harry felt his face grow warm and faked a small coughing fit over his roll when he emerged from this he wa sorry to find that hermione wa still in full flow about owl grade so top grade o for outstanding she wa saying and then there is a no e george corrected her e for exceeds expectation and i have always thought fred and i should have got e in everything because we exceeded expectation just by turning up for the exam they all laughed except hermione who plowed on so after e it a for acceptable and that is the last pas grade is not it yep said fred dunking an entire roll in his soup transferring it to his mouth and swallowing it whole then you get p for poor ron raised both his arm in mock celebration and d for dreadful and then t george reminded him t asked hermione looking appalled even lower than a d what on earth doe that stand for troll said george promptly harry laughed again though he wa not sure whether or not george wa joking he imagined trying to conceal from hermione that he had received t in all page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling his owl and immediately resolved to work harder from now on you lot had an inspected lesson yet fred asked them no said hermione at once have you just now before lunch said george charm what wa it like harry and hermione asked together fred shrugged not that bad umbridge just lurked in the corner making note on a clipboard you know what flitwicks like he treated her like a guest did not seem to bother him at all she did not say much asked alicia a couple of question about what the class are normally like alicia told her they were really good that wa it i can not see old flitwick getting marked down said george he usually get everyone through their exam all right who have you got this afternoon fred asked harry trelawney a t if ever i saw one and umbridge herself well be a good boy and keep your temper with umbridge today said george angelinall do her nut if you miss any more quidditch practice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but harry did not have to wait for defense against the dark art to meet professor umbridge he wa pulling out his dream diary in a seat at the very back of the shadowy divination room when ron elbowed him in the rib and looking round he saw professor umbridge emerging through the trapdoor in the floor the class which had been talking cheerily fell silent at once the abrupt fall in the noise level made professor trelawney who had been wafting about handing out dream oracle look round good afternoon professor trelawney said professor umbridge with her wide smile you received my note i trust giving the time and date of your inspection professor trelawney nodded curtly and looking very disgruntled turned her back on professor umbridge and continued to give out book still smiling professor umbridge grasped the back of the nearest armchair and pulled it to the front of the class so that it wa a few inch behind professor trelawneys seat she then sat down took her clipboard from her flowery bag and looked up expectantly waiting for the class to begin professor trelawney pulled her shawl tight about her with slightly trembling hand and surveyed the class through her hugely magnifying lens we shall be continuing our study of prophetic dream today she said in a brave attempt at her usual mystic tone though her voice shook slightly divide into pair please and interpret each others latest nighttime vision with the aid of the oracle she made a though to sweep back to her seat saw professor umbridge sitting right beside it and immediately veered left toward parvati and lavender who were already deep in discussion about parvati most recent dream page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry opened his copy of the dream oracle watching umbridge covertly she wa making note on her clipboard now after a few minute she got to her foot and began to pace the room in trelawneys wake listening to her conversation with student and posing question here and there harry bent his head hurriedly over his book think of a dream quick he told ron in case the old toad come our way i did it last time ron protested it your turn you tell me one oh i do not know said harry desperately who could not remember dreaming anything at all over the last few day let u say i dreamed i wa drowning snape in my cauldron yeah that will do ron chortled a he opened his dream oracle okay we have got to add your age to the date you had the dream the number of letter in the subject would that be drowning or cauldron or snape it doe not matter pick any of them said harry chancing a glance behind him professor umbridge wa now standing at professor trelawneys shoulder making note while the divination teacher questioned neville about his dream diary what night did you dream this again ron said immersed in calculation i do not know last night whenever you like harry told him trying to listen to what umbridge wa saying to professor trelawney they were only a table away from him and ron now professor umbridge wa page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling making another note on her clipboard and professor trelawney wa looking extremely put out now said umbridge looking up at trelawney you have been in this post how long exactly professor trelawney scowled at her arm crossed and shoulder hunched a though wishing to protect herself a much a possible from the indignity of the inspection after a slight pause in which she seemed to decide that the question wa not so offensive that she could reasonably ignore it she said in a deeply resentful tone nearly sixteen year quite a period said professor umbridge making a note on her clipboard so it wa professor dumbledore who appointed you that is right said professor trelawney shortly professor umbridge made another note and you are a greatgreatgranddaughter of the celebrated seer cassandra trelawney yes said professor trelawney holding her head a little higher another note on the clipboard but i think correct me if i am mistaken that you are the first in your family since cassandra to be possessed of second sight these thing often skip er three generation said professor trelawney professor umbridges toadlike smile widened page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling of course she said sweetly making yet another note well if you could just predict something for me then she looked up inquiringly still smiling professor trelawney had stiffened a though unable to believe her ear i do not understand you said professor trelawney clutching convulsively at the shawl around her scrawny neck id like you to make a prediction for me said professor umbridge very clearly harry and ron were not the only people watching and listening sneakily from behind their book now most of the class were staring transfixed at professor trelawney a she drew herself up to her full height her bead and bangle clinking the inner eye doe not see upon command she said in scandalized tone i see said professor umbridge softly making yet another note on her clipboard i but but wait said professor trelawney suddenly in an attempt at her usual ethereal voice though the mystical effect wa ruined somewhat by the way it wa shaking with anger i i think i do see something something that concern you why i sense something something dark some grave peril professor trelawney pointed a shaking finger at professor umbridge who continued to smile blandly at her eyebrow raised page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i am afraid i am afraid that you are in grave danger professor trelawney finished dramatically there wa a pause professor umbridges eyebrow were still raised right she said softly scribbling on her clipboard once more well if that is really the best you can do she turned away leaving professor trelawney standing rooted to the spot her chest heaving harry caught ron eye and knew that ron wa thinking exactly the same a he wa they both knew that professor trelawney wa an old fraud but on the other hand they loathed umbridge so much that they felt very much on trelawneys side until she swooped down on them a few second later that wa well she said snapping her long finger under harrys nose uncharacteristically brisk let me see the start you have made on your dream diary please and by the time she had interpreted harrys dream at the top of her voice all of which even the one that involved eating porridge apparently foretold a gruesome and early death he wa feeling much le sympathetic toward her all the while professor umbridge stood a few foot away making note on that clipboard and when the bell rang she descended the silver ladder first so that she wa waiting for them all when they reached their defense against the dark art lesson ten minute later she wa humming and smiling to herself when they entered the room harry and ron told hermione who had been in arithmancy exactly what had happened in divination while they all took out their copy of defensive magical theory but before hermione could page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ask any question professor umbridge had called them all to order and silence fell wand away she instructed them all smilingly and those people who had been hopeful enough to take them out sadly returned them to their bag a we finished chapter one last lesson i would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two common defensive theory and their derivation there will be no need to talk still smiling her wide selfsatisfied smile she sat down at her desk the class gave an audible sigh a it turned a one to page nineteen harry wondered dully whether there were enough chapter in the book to keep them reading through all this year lesson and wa on the point of checking the content when he noticed that hermione had her hand in the air again professor umbridge had noticed too and what wa more she seemed to have worked out a strategy for just such an eventuality instead of trying to pretend she had not noticed hermione she got to her foot and walked around the front row of desk until they were facetoface then she bent down and whispered so that the rest of the class could not hear what is it this time miss granger i have already read chapter two said hermione well then proceed to chapter three i have read that too i have read the whole book professor umbridge blinked but recovered her poise almost instantly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well then you should be able to tell me what slinkhard say about counterjinxes in chapter fifteen he say that counterjinxes are improperly named said hermione promptly he say counterjinx is just a name people give their jinx when they want to make them sound more acceptable professor umbridge raised her eyebrow and harry knew she wa impressed against her will but i disagree hermione continued professor umbridges eyebrow rose a little higher and her gaze became distinctly colder you disagree yes i do said hermione who unlike umbridge wa not whispering but speaking in a clear carrying voice that had by now attracted the rest of the class attention mr slinkhard doe not like jinx doe he but i think they can be very useful when they are used defensively oh you do do you said professor umbridge forgetting to whisper and straightening up well i am afraid it is mr slinkhard s opinion and not yours that matter within this classroom miss granger but hermione began that is enough said professor umbridge she walked back to the front of the class and stood before them all the jauntiness she had shown at the beginning of the lesson gone miss granger i am going to take five point from gryffindor house page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there wa an outbreak of muttering at this what for said harry angrily do not you get involved hermione whispered urgently to him for disrupting my class with pointless interruption said professor umbridge smoothly i am here to teach you using a ministryapproved method that doe not include inviting student to give their opinion on matter about which they understand very little your previous teacher in this subject may have allowed you more license but a none of them with the possible exception of professor quirrell who did at least appear to have restricted himself to ageappropriate subject would have passed a ministry inspection yeah quirrell wa a great teacher said harry loudly there wa just that minor drawback of him having lord voldemort sticking out of the back of his head this pronouncement wa followed by one of the loudest silence harry had ever heard then i think another week detention would do you some good mr potter said umbridge sleekly k k k the cut on the back of harrys hand had barely healed and by the following morning it wa bleeding again he did not complain during the evening detention he wa determined not to give umbridge the satisfaction over and over again he wrote i must page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling not tell lie and not a sound escaped his lip though the cut deepened with every letter the very worst part of this second week worth of detention wa just a george had predicted angelinas reaction she cornered him just a he arrived at the gryffindor table for breakfast on tuesday and shouted so loudly that professor mcgonagall came sweeping down upon the pair of them from the staff table miss johnson how dare you make such a racket in the great hall five point from gryffindor but professor he gone and landed himself in detention again what is this potter said professor mcgonagall sharply rounding on harry detention from whom from professor umbridge muttered harry not meeting professor mcgonagalls beady squareframed eye are you telling me she said lowering her voice so that the group of curious ravenclaws behind them could not hear that after the warning i gave you last monday you lost your temper in professor umbridges class again yes harry muttered speaking to the floor potter you must get a grip on yourself you are heading for serious trouble another five point from gryffindor page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but what professor no harry said furious at this injustice i am already being punished by her why do you have to take point a well because detention do not appear to have any effect on you whatsoever said professor mcgonagall tartly no not another word of complaint potter and a for you miss johnson you will confine your shouting match to the quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team captaincy she strode back toward the staff table angelina gave harry a look of deepest disgust and stalked away upon which harry flung himself onto the bench beside ron fuming she is taken point off gryffindor because i am having my hand sliced open every night how is that fair how i know mate said ron sympathetically tipping bacon onto harrys plate she is bang out of order hermione however merely rustled the page of her daily prophet and said nothing you think mcgonagall wa right do you said harry angrily to the picture of cornelius fudge obscuring hermione s face i wish she had not taken point from you but i think she is right to warn you not to lose your temper with umbridge said hermiones voice while fudge gesticulated forcefully from the front page clearly giving some kind of speech harry did not speak to hermione all through charm but when they entered transfiguration he forgot his anger professor umbridge and her clipboard were page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sitting in a corner and the sight of her drove the memory of breakfast right out of his head excellent whispered ron a they sat down in their usual seat let u see umbridge get what she deserves professor mcgonagall marched into the room without giving the slightest indication that she knew professor umbridge wa there that will do she said and silence fell immediately mr finnigan kindly come here and hand back the homework miss brown please take this box of mouse do not be silly girl they will not hurt you and hand one to each student hem hem said professor umbridge employing the same silly little cough she had used to interrupt dumbledore on the first night of term professor mcgonagall ignored her seamus handed back harrys essay harry took it without looking at him and saw to his relief that he had managed an a right then everyone listen closely dean thomas if you do that to the mouse again i shall put you in detention most of you have now successfully vanished your snail and even those who were left with a certain amount of she will have the gist of the spell today we shall be hem hem said professor umbridge yes said professor mcgonagall turning round her eyebrow so close together they seemed to form one long severe line page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i wa just wondering professor whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec obviously i received it or i would have asked you what you are doing in my classroom said professor mcgonagall turning her back firmly on professor umbridge many of the student exchanged look of glee a i wa saying today we shall be practicing the altogether more difficult vanishment of mouse now the vanishing spell hem hem i wonder said professor mcgonagall in cold fury turning on professor umbridge how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching method if you continue to interrupt me you see i do not generally permit people to talk when i am talking professor umbridge looked a though she had just been slapped in the face she did not speak but straightened the parchment on her clipboard and began scribbling furiously looking supremely unconcerned professor mcgonagall addressed the class once more a i wa saying the vanishing spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished the snail a an invertebrate doe not present much of a challenge the mouse a a mammal offer a much greater one this is not therefore magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner so you know the incantation let me see what you can do how she can lecture me about not losing my temper with umbridge harry said to ron under his voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but he wa grinning his anger with professor mcgonagall had quite evaporated professor umbridge did not follow professor mcgonagall around the class a she had followed professor trelawney perhaps she thought that professor mcgonagall would not permit it she did however take many more note while she sat in her corner and when professor mcgonagall finally told them all to pack away rose with a grim expression on her face well it a start said ron holding up a long wriggling mouse tail and dropping it back into the box lavender wa passing around a they filed out of the classroom harry saw professor umbridge approach the teacher desk he nudged ron who nudged hermione in turn and the three of them deliberately fell back to eavesdrop how long have you been teaching at hogwarts professor umbridge asked thirtynine year this december said professor mcgonagall brusquely snapping her bag shut professor umbridge made a note very well she said you will receive the result of your inspection in ten day time i can hardly wait said professor mcgonagall in a coldly indifferent voice and she strode off toward the door hurry up you three she added sweeping harry ron and hermione before her harry could not help giving her a faint smile and could have sworn he received one in return page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he had thought that the next time he would see umbridge would be in his detention that evening but he wa wrong when they walked down the lawn toward the forest for care of magical creature they found her and her clipboard waiting for them beside professor grubblyplank you do not usually take this class is that correct harry heard her ask a they arrived at the trestle table where the group of captive bowtruckles were scrabbling around for wood louse like so many living twig quite correct said professor grubblyplank hand behind her back and bouncing on the ball of her foot i am a substitute teacher standing in for professor hagrid harry exchanged uneasy look with ron and hermione malfoy wa whispering with crabbe and goyle he would surely love this opportunity to tell tale on hagrid to a member of the ministry hmm said professor umbridge dropping her voice though harry could still hear her quite clearly i wonder the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter can you tell me what is causing professor hagrids very extended leave of absence harry saw malfoy look up eagerly fraid i can not said professor grubblyplank breezily do not know anything more about it than you do got an owl from dumbledore would i like a couple of week teaching work accepted that is a much a i know well shall i get started then page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes please do said professor umbridge scribbling upon her clipboard umbridge took a different tack in this class and wandered among the student questioning them on magical creature most people were able to answer well and harrys spirit lifted somewhat at least the class wa not letting hagrid down overall said professor umbridge returning to professor grubblyplanks side after a lengthy interrogation of dean thomas how do you a a temporary member of staff an objective outsider i suppose you might say how do you find hogwarts do you feel you receive enough support from the school management oh yes dumbledores excellent said professor grubblyplank heartily no i am very happy with the way thing are run very happy indeed looking politely incredulous umbridge made a tiny note on her clipboard and went on and what are you planning to cover with this class this year assuming of course that professor hagrid doe not return oh ill take them through the creature that most often come up in owl said professor grubbly plank not much left to do they have studied unicorn and nifflers i thought wed cover porlocks and kneazles make sure they can recognize crups and knarls you know well you seem to know what you are doing at any rate said professor umbridge making a very obvious tick on her clipboard harry did not like the emphasis she put on you and liked it even le when she put page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling her next question to goyle now i hear there have been injury in this class goyle gave a stupid grin malfoy hastened to answer the question that wa me he said i wa slashed by a hippogriff a hippogriff said professor umbridge now scribbling frantically only because he wa too stupid to listen to what hagrid told him to do said harry angrily both ron and hermione groaned professor umbridge turned her head slowly in harrys direction another night detention i think she said softly well thank you very much professor grubblyplank i think that is all i need here you will be receiving the result of your inspection within ten day jolly good said professor grubblyplank and professor umbridge set off back across the lawn to the castle ie ie ie it wa nearly midnight when harry left umbridges office that night his hand now bleeding so severely that it wa staining the scarf he had wrapped around it he expected the common room to be empty when he returned but ron and hermione had sat up waiting for him he wa pleased to see them especially a hermione wa disposed to be sympathetic rather than critical page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling here she said anxiously pushing a small bowl of yellow liquid toward him soak your hand in that it a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacle it should help harry placed his bleeding aching hand into the bowl and experienced a wonderful feeling of relief crookshanks curled around his leg purring loudly and then leapt into his lap and settled down thanks he said gratefully scratching behind crookshanks s ear with his left hand i still reckon you should complain about this said ron in a low voice no said harry flatly mcgonagall would go nut if she knew yeah she probably would said harry and how long dyou reckon it would take umbridge to pas another decree saying anyone who complains about the high inquisitor get sacked immediately ron opened his mouth to retort but nothing came out and after a moment he closed it again in a defeated sort of way she is an awful woman said hermione in a small voice awful you know i wa just saying to ron when you came in we have got to do something about her i suggested poison said ron grimly no i mean something about what a dreadful teacher she is and how were not going to learn any defense from her at all said hermione page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well what can we do about that said ron yawning s too late is not it she got the job she is here to stay fudgell make sure of that well said hermione tentatively you know i wa thinking today she shot a slightly nervous look at harry and then plunged on i wa thinking that maybe the time come when we should just just do it ourselves do what ourselves said harry suspiciously still floating his hand in the essence of murtlap tentacle well learn defense against the dark art ourselves said hermione come off it groaned ron you want u to do extra work dyou realize harry and i are behind on homework again and it only the second week but this is much more important than homework said hermione harry and ron goggled at her i did not think there wa anything in the universe more important than homework said ron do not be silly of course there is said hermione and harry saw with an ominous feeling that her face wa suddenly alight with the kind of fervor that spew usually inspired in her it about preparing ourselves like harry said in umbridges first lesson for what is waiting out there it about making sure we really can defend ourselves if we do not learn anything for a whole year we can not do much by ourselves said ron in a defeated voice i mean all right we can go and look page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling jinx up in the library and try and practice them i suppose no i agree we have gone past the stage where we can just learn thing out of book said hermione we need a teacher a proper one who can show u how to use the spell and correct u if were going wrong if you are talking about lupin harry began no no i am not talking about lupin said hermione he too busy with the order and anyway the most we could see him is during hogsmeade weekend and that is not nearly often enough who then said harry frowning at her hermione heaved a very deep sigh is not it obvious she said i am talking about you harry there wa a moment silence a light night breeze rattled the windowpane behind ron and the fire guttered about me what said harry i am talking about you teaching u defense against the dark art harry stared at her then he turned to ron ready to exchange the exasperated look they sometimes shared when hermione elaborated on farfetched scheme like spew to harrys consternation however ron did not look exasperated he wa frowning slightly apparently thinking then he said that is an idea page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what is an idea said harry you said ron teaching u to do it but harry wa grinning now sure the pair of them were pulling his leg but i am not a teacher i can not harry you are the best in the year at defense against the dark art said hermione me said harry now grinning more broadly than ever no i am not you have beaten me in every test actually i have not said hermione coolly you beat me in our third year the only year we both sat the test and had a teacher who actually knew the subject but i am not talking about test result harry look what you have done how dyou mean you know what i am not sure i want someone this stupid teaching me ron said to hermione smirking slightly he turned to harry let u think he said pulling a face like goyle concentrating uh first year you saved the stone from youknowwho but that wa luck said harry that wa not skill second year ron interrupted you killed the basilisk and destroyed riddle yeah but if fawkes had not turned up i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling third year said ron louder still you fought off about a hundred dementors at once you know that wa a fluke if the timeturner had not last year ron said almost shouting now you fought off youknowwho again listen to me said harry almost angrily because ron and hermione were both smirking now just listen to me all right it sound great when you say it like that but all that stuff wa luck i did not know what i wa doing half the time i did not plan any of it i just did whatever i could think of and i nearly always had help ron and hermione were still smirking and harry felt his temper rise he wa not even sure why he wa feeling so angry do not sit there grinning like you know better than i do i wa there wa not i he said heatedly i know what went on all right and i did not get through any of that because i wa brilliant at defense against the dark art i got through it all because because help came at the right time or because i guessed right but i just blundered through it all i did not have a clue what i wa doing stop laughing the bowl of murtlap essence fell to the floor and smashed he became aware that he wa on his foot though he could not remember standing up crookshanks streaked away under a sofa ron and hermione s smile had vanished you do not know what it likel you neither of you you have never had to face him have you you think it just memorizing a bunch of spell and throwing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling them at him like you are in class or something the whole time you know there is nothing between you and dying except your own your own brain or gut or whatever like you can think straight when you know you are about a second from being murdered or tortured or watching your friend die they have never taught u that in their class what it like to deal with thing like that and you two sit there acting like i am a clever little boy to be standing here alive like diggory wa stupid like he messed up you just do not get it that could just a easily have been me it would have been if voldemort had not needed me we were not saying anything like that mate said ron looking aghast we were not having a go at diggory we did not you have got the wrong end of the he looked helplessly at hermione whose face wa stricken harry she said timidly do not you see this this is exactly why we need you we need to know what it rreally like facing him facing vvoldemort it wa the first time she had ever said voldemorts name and it wa this more than anything else that calmed harry still breathing hard he sank back into his chair becoming aware a he did so that his hand wa throbbing horribly again he wished he had not smashed the bowl of murtlap essence well think about it said hermione quietly please harry could not think of anything to say he wa feeling ashamed of his outburst already he nodded hardly aware of what he wa agreeing to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hermione stood up well i am off to bed she said in a voice that wa clearly a natural a she could make it erm night ron had gotten to his foot too coming he said awkwardly to harry yeah said harry in in a minute ill just clear this up he indicated the smashed bowl on the floor ron nodded and left reparo harry muttered pointing his wand at the broken piece of china they flew back together good a new but there wa no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl he wa suddenly so tired that he wa tempted to sink back into his armchair and sleep there but instead he got to his foot and followed ron upstairs his restless night wa punctuated once more by dream of long corridor and locked door and he awoke next day with his scar prickling again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling in the hog head hermione made no mention of harry giving defense against the dark art lesson for two whole week after her original suggestion harrys detention with umbridge were finally over he doubted whether the word now etched on the back of his hand would ever fade entirely ron had had four more quidditch practice and not been shouted at during the last two and all three of them had managed to vanish their mouse in transfiguration hermione had actually progressed to vanishing kitten before the subject wa broached again on a wild blustery evening at the end of september when the three of them were sitting in the library looking up potion ingredient for snape i wa wondering hermione said suddenly whether you would thought any more about defense against the dark art harry course i have said harry grumpily can not forget it can we with that hag teaching u page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i meant the idea ron and i had ron cast her an alarmed threatening kind of look she frowned at him oh all right the idea had then about you teaching u harry did not answer at once he pretended to be perusing a page of asiatic antivenoms because he did not want to say what wa in his mind the fact wa that he had given the matter a great deal of thought over the past fortnight sometimes it seemed an insane idea just a it had on the night hermione had proposed it but at others he had found himself thinking about the spell that had served him best in his various encounter with dark creature and death eater found himself in fact subconsciously planning lesson well he said slowly when he could not pretend to find asiatic antivenoms interesting much longer yeah i i have thought about it a bit and said hermione eagerly i do not know said harry playing for time he looked up at ron i thought it wa a good idea from the start said ron who seemed keener to join in this conversation now that he wa sure that harry wa not going to start shouting again harry shifted uncomfortably in his chair you did listen to what i said about a load of it being luck did not you yes harry said hermione gently but all the same there is no point pretending that you are not good at page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling defense against the dark art because you are you were the only person last year who could throw off the imperius curse completely you can produce a patronus you can do all sort of stuff that fullgrown wizard can not viktor always said ron looked around at her so fast he appeared to crick his neck rubbing it he said yeah what did vicky say ho ho said hermione in a bored voice he said harry knew how to do stuff even he did not and he wa in the final year at durmstrang ron wa looking at hermione suspiciously you are not still in contact with him are you so what if i am said hermione coolly though her face wa a little pink i can have a pen pal if i he did not only want to be your pen pal said ron accusingly hermione shook her head exasperatedly and ignoring ron who wa continuing to watch her said to harry well what do you think will you teach u just you and ron yeah well said hermione now looking a mite anxious again well now do not fly off the handle again harry please but i really think you ought to teach anyone who want to learn i mean were talking about defending ourselves against vvoldemort oh do not be pathetic ron it doe not seem fair if we do not offer the chance to other people page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry considered this for a moment then said yeah but i doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me i am a nutter remember well i think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you have got to say said hermione seriously look she leaned toward him ron who wa still watching her with a frown on his face leaned forward to listen too you know the first weekend in october a hogsmeade weekend how would it be if we tell anyone who is interested to meet u in the village and we can talk it over why do we have to do it outside school said ron because said hermione returning to the diagram of the chinese chomping cabbage she wa copying i do not think umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to harry had been looking forward to the weekend trip into hogsmeade but there wa one thing worrying him sirius had maintained a stony silence since he had appeared in the fire at the beginning of september harry knew they had made him angry by saying that they did not want him to come but he still worried from time to time that sirius might throw caution to the wind and turn up anyway what were they going to do if the great black dog came bounding up the street toward them in hogsmeade perhaps under the nose of draco malfoy well you can not blame him for wanting to get out and about said ron when harry discussed his fear with him and hermione i mean he been on the run for over two year ha not he and i know that can not have been a laugh but at least he wa free page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wa not he and now he just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf hermione scowled at ron but otherwise ignored the slight on kreacher the trouble is she said to harry until vvoldemort oh for heaven sake ron come out into the open sirius is going to have to stay hidden is not he i mean the stupid ministry is not going to realize sirius is innocent until they accept that dumbledores been telling the truth about him all along and once the fool start catching real death eater again it will be obvious sirius is not one i mean he ha not got the mark for one thing i do not reckon he would be stupid enough to turn up said ron bracingly dumbledored go mad if he did and sirius listens to dumbledore even if he doe not like what he hears when harry continued to look worried hermione said listen ron and i have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper defense against the dark art and there are a couple who seem interested we have told them to meet u in hogsmeade right said harry vaguely his mind still on sirius do not worry harry hermione said quietly you have got enough on your plate without sirius too she wa quite right of course he wa barely keeping up with his homework though he wa doing much better now that he wa no longer spending every evening in detention with umbridge ron wa even further behind with his work than harry because while they both had quidditch practice twice a week page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ron also had prefect duty however hermione who wa taking more subject than either of them had not only finished all her homework but wa also finding time to knit more elf clothes harry had to admit that she wa getting better it wa now almost always possible to distinguish between the hat and the sock the morning of the hogsmeade visit dawned bright but windy after breakfast they queued up in front of filch who matched their name to the long list of student who had permission from their parent or guardian to visit the village with a slight pang harry remembered that if it had not been for sirius he would not have been going at all when harry reached filch the caretaker gave a great sniff a though trying to detect a whiff of something from harry then he gave a curt nod that set his jowl aquiver again and harry walked on out onto the stone step and the cold sunlit day er why wa filch sniffing you asked ron a he harry and hermione set off at a brisk pace down the wide drive to the gate i suppose he wa checking for the smell of dungbombs said harry with a small laugh i forgot to tell you and he recounted the story of sending his letter to sirius and filch bursting in second later demanding to see the letter to his slight surprise hermione found this story highly interesting much more indeed than he did himself he said he wa tipped off you were ordering dungbombs but who had tipped him off page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i do not know said harry shrugging maybe malfoy he would think it wa a laugh they walked between the tall stone pillar topped with winged boar and turned left onto the road into the village the wind whipping their hair into their eye malfoy said hermione very skeptically well yes maybe and she remained deep in thought all the way into the outskirt of hogsmeade where are we going anyway harry asked the three broomstick oh no said hermione coming out of her reverie no it always packed and really noisy i have told the others to meet u in the hog head that other pub you know the one it not on the main road i think it a bit you know dodgy but student do not normally go in there so i do not think well be overheard they walked down the main street past zonkos joke shop where they were unsurprised to see fred george and lee jordan past the post office from which owl issued at regular interval and turned up a side street at the top of which stood a small inn a battered wooden sign hung from a rusty bracket over the door with a picture upon it of a wild boar severed head leaking blood onto the white cloth around it the sign creaked in the wind a they approached all three of them hesitated outside the door well come on said hermione slightly nervously harry led the way inside page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa not at all like the three broomstick whose large bar gave an impression of gleaming warmth and cleanliness the hog head bar comprised one small dingy and very dirty room that smelled strongly of something that might have been goat the bay window were so encrusted with grime that very little daylight could permeate the room which wa lit instead with the stub of candle sitting on rough wooden table the floor seemed at first glance to be earthy though a harry stepped onto it he realized that there wa stone beneath what seemed to be the accumulated filth of century harry remembered hagrid mentioning this pub in his first year yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hog head he had said explaining how he had won a dragon egg from a hooded stranger there at the time harry had wondered why hagrid had not found it odd that the stranger kept his face hidden throughout their encounter now he saw that keeping your face hidden wa something of a fashion in the hog head there wa a man at the bar whose whole head wa wrapped in dirty gray bandage though he wa still managing to gulp endless glass of some smoking fiery substance through a slit over his mouth two figure shrouded in hood sat at a table in one of the window harry might have thought them dementors if they had not been talking in strong yorkshire accent in a shadowy corner beside the fireplace sat a witch with a thick black veil that fell to her toe they could just see the tip of her nose because it caused the veil to protrude slightly i do not know about this hermione harry muttered a they crossed to the bar he wa looking particularly at the heavily veiled witch ha it occurred to you umbridge might be under that hermione cast an appraising eye at the veiled figure page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling umbridge is shorter than that woman she said quietly and anyway even if umbridge doe come in here there is nothing she can do to stop u harry because i have double and triplechecked the school rule were not outofbounds i specifically asked professor flitwick whether student were allowed to come in the hog head and he said yes but he advised me strongly to bring our own glass and i have looked up everything i can think of about study group and homework group and they are definitely allowed i just do not think it a good idea if we parade what were doing no said harry dryly especially a it not exactly a homework group you are planning is it the barman sidled toward them out of a back room he wa a grumpylooking old man with a great deal of long gray hair and beard he wa tall and thin and looked vaguely familiar to harry what he grunted three butterbeers please said hermione the man reached beneath the counter and pulled up three very dusty very dirty bottle which he slammed on the bar six sickle he said ill get them said harry quickly passing over the silver the barman eye traveled over harry resting for a fraction of a second on his scar then he turned away and deposited harrys money in an ancient wooden till whose drawer slid open automatically to receive it harry ron and hermione retreated to the farthest table from the bar and sat down looking around while the man in the dirty gray bandage page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling rapped the counter with his knuckle and received another smoking drink from the barman you know what ron murmured looking over at the bar with enthusiasm we could order anything we liked in here i bet that bloke would sell u anything he would not care i have always wanted to try firewhisky you are a prefect snarled hermione oh said ron the smile fading from his face yeah so who did you say is supposed to be meeting u harry asked wrenching open the rusty top of his butterbeer and taking a swig just a couple of people hermione repeated checking her watch and then looking anxiously toward the door i told them to be here about now and i am sure they all know where it is oh look this might be them now the door of the pub had opened a thick band of dusty sunlight split the room in two for a moment and then vanished blocked by the incoming rush of a crowd of people first came neville with dean and lavender who were closely followed by parvati and padma patil with harrys stomach did a back flip cho and one of her usually giggling girlfriend then on her own and looking so dreamy that she might have walked in by accident luna lovegood then katie bell alicia spinnet and angelina johnson colin and dennis creevey ernie macmillan justin finchfletchley hannah abbott and a hufflepuff girl with a long plait down her back whose name harry did not know page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling three ravenclaw boy he wa pretty sure were called anthony goldstein michael corner and terry boot ginny followed by a tall skinny blond boy with an upturned nose whom harry recognized vaguely a being a member of the hufflepuff quidditch team and bringing up the rear fred and george weasley with their friend lee jordan all three of whom were carrying large paper bag crammed with zonkos merchandise a couple of people said harry hoarsely to hermione a couple of people yes well the idea seemed quite popular said hermione happily ron do you want to pull up some more chair the barman had frozen in the act of wiping out a glass with a rag so filthy it looked a though it had never been washed possibly he had never seen his pub so full hi said fred reaching the bar first and counting his companion quickly could we have twenty five butterbeers please the barman glared at him for a moment then throwing down his rag irritably a though he had been interrupted in something very important he started passing up dusty butterbeers from under the bar cheer said fred handing them out cough up everyone i have not got enough gold for all of these harry watched numbly a the large chattering group took their beer from fred and rummaged in their robe to find coin he could not imagine what all these people had turned up for until the horrible page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling thought occurred to him that they might be expecting some kind of speech at which he rounded on hermione what have you been telling people he said in a low voice what are they expecting i have told you they just want to hear what you have got to say said hermione soothingly but harry continued to look at her so furiously that she added quickly you do not have to do anything yet ill speak to them first hi harry said neville beaming and taking a seat opposite harry harry tried to smile back but did not speak his mouth wa exceptionally dry cho had just smiled at him and sat down on ron right her friend who had curly reddishblonde hair did not smile but gave harry a thoroughly mistrustful look that told harry plainly that given her way she would not be here at all in two and three the new arrival settled around harry ron and hermione some looking rather excited others curious luna lovegood gazing dreamily into space when everybody had pulled up a chair the chatter died out every eye wa upon harry er said hermione her voice slightly higher than usual out of nerve well er hi the group focused it attention on her instead though eye continued to dart back regularly to harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well erm well you know why you are here erm well harry here had the idea i mean harry had thrown her a sharp look i had the idea that it might be good if people who wanted to study defense against the dark art and i mean really study it you know not the rubbish that umbridge is doing with u hermiones voice became suddenly much stronger and more confident because nobody could call that defense against the dark art hear hear said anthony goldstein and hermione looked heartened well i thought it would be good if we well took matter into our own hand she paused looked sideways at harry and went on and by that i mean learning how to defend ourselves properly not just theory but the real spell you want to pas your defense against the dark art owl too though i bet said michael corner of course i do said hermione at once but i want more than that i want to be properly trained in defense because because she took a great breath and finished because lord voldemorts back the reaction wa immediate and predictable chos friend shrieked and slopped butterbeer down herself terry boot gave a kind of involuntary twitch padma patil shuddered and neville gave an odd yelp that he managed to turn into a cough all of them however looked fixedly even eagerly at harry well that is the plan anyway said hermione if you want to join u we need to decide how were going to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling where is the proof youknow who is back said the blond hufflepuff player in a rather aggressive voice well dumbledore belief it hermione began you mean dumbledore belief him said the blond boy nodding at harry who are you said ron rather rudely zacharias smith said the boy and i think we have got the right to know exactly what make him say youknowwhos back look said hermione intervening swiftly that is really not what this meeting wa supposed to be about it okay hermione said harry it had just dawned upon him why there were so many people there he felt that hermione should have seen this coming some of these people maybe even most of them had turned up in the hope of hearing harrys story firsthand what make me say youknowwhos back he asked looking zacharias straight in the face i saw him but dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year and if you did not believe him you do not believe me and i am not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone the whole group seemed to have held it breath while harry spoke harry had the impression that even the barman wa listening in he wa wiping the same glass with the filthy rag it wa becoming steadily dirtier page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling zacharias said dismissively all dumbledore told u last year wa that cedric diggory got killed by you knowwho and that you brought diggorys body back to hogwarts he did not give u detail he did not tell u exactly how diggory got murdered i think wed all like to know if you have come to hear exactly what it look like when voldemort murder someone i can not help you harry said his temper always so close to the surface these day wa rising again he did not take his eye from zacharias smith aggressive face determined not to look at cho i do not want to talk about cedric diggory all right so if that is what you are here for you might a well clear out he cast an angry look in hermiones direction this wa he felt all her fault she had decided to display him like some sort of freak and of course they had all turned up to see just how wild his story wa but none of them left their seat not even zacharias smith though he continued to gaze intently at harry so said hermione her voice very highpitched again so like i wa saying if you want to learn some defense then we need to work out how were going to do it how often were going to meet and where were going to is it true interrupted the girl with the long plait down her back looking at harry that you can produce a patronus there wa a murmur of interest around the group at this yeah said harry slightly defensively a corporeal patronus page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the phrase stirred something in harrys memory er you do not know madam bone do you he asked the girl smiled she is my auntie she said i am susan bone she told me about your hearing so is it really true you make a stag patronus yes said harry blimey harry said lee looking deeply impressed i never knew that mum told ron not to spread it around said fred grinning at harry she said you got enough attention a it wa she is not wrong mumbled harry and a couple of people laughed the veiled witch sitting alone shifted very slightly in her seat and did you kill a basilisk with that sword in dumbledores office demanded terry boot that is what one of the portrait on the wall told me when i wa in there last year er yeah i did yeah said harry justin finchfletchley whistled the creevey brother exchanged awestruck look and lavender brown said wow softly harry wa feeling slightly hot around the collar now he wa determinedly looking anywhere but at cho and in our first year said neville to the group at large he saved that sorcerous stone page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sorcerer hissed hermione yes that from youknowwho finished neville hannah abbotts eye were a round a galleon and that is not to mention said cho harrys eye snapped onto her she wa looking at him smiling his stomach did another somersault all the task he had to get through in the triwizard tournament last year getting past dragon and merpeople and acromantulas and thing there wa a murmur of impressed agreement around the table harrys inside were squirming he wa trying to arrange his face so that he did not look too pleased with himself the fact that cho had just praised him made it much much harder for him to say the thing he had sworn to himself he would tell them look he said and everyone fell silent at once i i do not want to sound like i am trying to be modest or anything but i had a lot of help with all that stuff not with the dragon you did not said michael corner at once that wa a seriously cool bit of flying yeah well said harry feeling it would be churlish to disagree and nobody helped you get rid of those dementors this summer said susan bone no said harry no okay i know i did bit of it without help but the point i am trying to make is page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling are you trying to weasel out of showing u any of this stuff said zacharias smith here is an idea said ron loudly before harry could speak why do not you shut your mouth perhaps the word weasel had affected ron particularly strongly in any case he wa now looking at zacharias a though he would like nothing better than to thump him zacharias flushed well we have all turned up to learn from him and now he telling u he can not really do any of it he said that is not what he said snarled fred weasley would you like u to clean out your ear for you inquired george pulling a long and lethallooking metal instrument from inside one of the zonkos bag or any part of your body really were not fussy where we stick this said fred yes well said hermione hastily moving on the point is are we agreed we want to take lesson from harry there wa a murmur of general agreement zacharias folded his arm and said nothing though perhaps this wa because he wa too busy keeping an eye on the instrument in george hand right said hermione looking relieved that something had at last been settled well then the next question is how often we do it i really do not think there is any point in meeting le than once a week page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hang on said angelina we need to make sure this doe not clash with our quidditch practice no said cho nor with ours nor ours added zacharias smith i am sure we can find a night that suit everyone said hermione slightly impatiently but you know this is rather important were talking about learning to defend ourselves against vvoldemorts death eater well said barked ernie macmillan whom harry had been expecting to speak long before this personally i think this is really important possibly more important than anything else well do this year even with our owl coming up he looked around impressively a though waiting for people to cry surely not when nobody spoke he went on i personally am at a loss to see why the ministry ha foisted such a useless teacher upon u at this critical period obviously they are in denial about the return of youknowwho but to give u a teacher who is trying to actively prevent u from using defensive spell we think the reason umbridge doe not want u trained in defense against the dark art said hermione is that she is got some some mad idea that dumbledore could use the student in the school a a kind of private army she think he would mobilize u against the ministry nearly everybody looked stunned at this news everybody except luna lovegood who piped up well that make sense after all cornelius fudge ha got his own private army page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what said harry completely thrown by this unexpected piece of information yes he got an army of heliopaths said luna solemnly no he ha not snapped hermione yes he ha said luna what are heliopaths asked neville looking blank they are spirit of fire said luna her protuberant eye widening so that she looked madder than ever great tall flaming creature that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of they do not exist neville said hermione tartly oh yes they do said luna angrily i am sorry but where is the proof of that snapped hermione there are plenty of eyewitness account just because you are so narrowminded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you hem hem said ginny in such a good imitation of professor umbridge that several people looked around in alarm and then laughed were not we trying to decide how often were going to meet and get defense lesson yes said hermione at once yes we were you are right well once a week sound cool said lee jordan page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a long a began angelina yes yes we know about the quidditch said hermione in a tense voice well the other thing to decide is where were going to meet this wa rather more difficult the whole group fell silent library suggested katie bell after a few moment i can not see madam pince being too chuffed with u doing jinx in the library said harry maybe an unused classroom said dean yeah said ron mcgonagall might let u have hers she did when harry wa practicing for the tri wizard but harry wa pretty certain that mcgonagall would not be so accommodating this time for all that hermione had said about study and homework group being allowed he had the distinct feeling this one might be considered a lot more rebellious right well well try to find somewhere said hermione well send a message round to everybody when we have got a time and a place for the first meeting she rummaged in her bag and produced parchment and a quill then hesitated rather a though she wa steeling herself to say something ii think everybody should write their name down just so we know who wa here but i also think she took a deep breath that we all ought to agree not to shout about what were doing so if you sign you are page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling agreeing not to tell umbridge or anybody else what were up to fred reached out for the parchment and cheerfully put down his signature but harry noticed at once that several people looked le than happy at the prospect of putting their name on the list er said zacharias slowly not taking the parchment that george wa trying to pas him well i am sure ernie will tell me when the meeting is but ernie wa looking rather hesitant about signing too hermione raised her eyebrow at him i well we are prefect ernie burst out and if this list wa found well i mean to say you said yourself if umbridge find out you just said this group wa the most important thing you would do this year harry reminded him i yes said ernie yes i do believe that it just ernie do you really think id leave that list lying around said hermione testily no no of course not said ernie looking slightly le anxious i yes of course ill sign nobody raised objection after ernie though harry saw chos friend give her a rather reproachful look before adding her name when the last person zacharias had signed hermione took the parchment back and slipped it carefully into her bag there wa an odd feeling in the group now it wa a though they had just signed some kind of contract page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well time ticking on said fred briskly getting to his foot george lee and i have got item of a sensitive nature to purchase well be seeing you all later in two and three the rest of the group took their leave too cho made rather a business of fastening the catch on her bag before leaving her long dark curtain of hair swinging forward to hide her face but her friend stood beside her arm folded clicking her tongue so that cho had little choice but to leave with her a her friend ushered her through the door cho looked back and waved at harry well i think that went quite well said hermione happily a she harry and ron walked out of the hog head into the bright sunlight a few moment later harry and ron still clutching their bottle of butterbeer that zacharias bloke a wart said ron who wa glowering after the figure of smith just discernible in the distance i do not like him much either admitted hermione but he overheard me talking to ernie and hannah at the hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming so what could i say but the more people the better really i mean michael corner and his friend would not have come if he had not been going out with ginny ron who had been draining the last few drop from his butterbeer bottle gagged and sprayed butterbeer down his front he what said ron outraged his ear now resembling curl of raw beef she is going out with page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling my sister going what dyou mean michael corner well that is why he and his friend came i think well they are obviously interested in learning defense but if ginny had not told michael what wa going on when did this when did she they met at the yule ball and they got together at the end of last year said hermione composedly they had turned into the high street and she paused outside scrivenshafts quill shop where there wa a handsome display of pheasantfeather quill in the window hmm i could do with a new quill she turned into the shop harry and ron followed her which one wa michael corner ron demanded furiously the dark one said hermione i did not like him said ron at once big surprise said hermione under her breath but said ron following hermione along a row of quill in copper pot i thought ginny fancied harry hermione looked at him rather pityingly and shook her head ginny used to fancy harry but she gave up on him month ago not that she doe not like you of course she added kindly to harry while she examined a long blackandgold quill page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry whose head wa still full of chos parting wave did not find this subject quite a interesting a ron who wa positively quivering with indignation but it did bring something home to him that until now he had not really registered so that is why she talk now he asked hermione she never used to talk in front of me exactly said hermione yes i think ill have this one she went up to the counter and handed over fifteen sickle and two knut ron still breathing down her neck ron she said severely a she turned and trod on his foot this is exactly why ginny ha not told you she is seeing michael she knew you would take it badly so do not harp on about it for heaven sake what dyou mean who is taking anything badly i am not going to harp on about anything ron continued to chunter under his breath all the way down the street hermione rolled her eye at harry and then said in an undertone while ron wa muttering imprecation about michael corner and talking about michael and ginny what about cho and you what dyou mean said harry quickly it wa a though boiling water wa rising rapidly inside him a burning sensation that wa causing his face to smart in the cold had he been that obvious well said hermione smiling slightly she just could not keep her eye off you could she page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry had never before appreciated just how beautiful the village of hogsmeade wa page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling educational decree number twentyfour harry felt happier for the rest of the weekend than he had done all term he and ron spent much of sunday catching up with all their homework again and although this could hardly be called fun the last burst of autumn sunshine persisted so rather than sitting hunched over table in the common room they took their work outside and lounged in the shade of a large beech tree on the edge of the lake hermione who of course wa up to date with all her work brought more wool outside with her and bewitched her knitting needle so that they flashed and clicked in midair beside her producing more hat and scarf the knowledge that they were doing something to resist umbridge and the ministry and that he wa a key part of the rebellion gave harry a feeling of immense satisfaction he kept reliving saturday meeting in his mind all those people coming to him to learn defense against the dark art and the look on their face a they had heard some of the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling thing he had done and cho praising his performance in the triwizard tournament the knowledge that all those people did not think him a lying weirdo but someone to be admired buoyed him up so much that he wa still cheerful on monday morning despite the imminent prospect of all his least favorite class he and ron headed downstairs from their dormitory together discussing angelinas idea that they were to work on a new move called the sloth grip roll during that night quidditch practice and not until they were halfway across the sunlit common room did they notice the addition to the room that had already attracted the attention of a small group of people a large sign had been affixed to the gryffindor notice board so large that it covered everything else on there the list of secondhand spellbooks for sale the regular reminder of school rule from argus filch the quidditch team training schedule the offer to barter certain chocolate frog card for others the weasleys new advertisement for tester the date of the hogsmeade weekend and the lostandfound notice the new sign wa printed in large black letter and there wa a highly officiallooking seal at the bottom beside a neat and curly signature by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts all student organization society team group and club are henceforth disbanded page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling an organization society team group or club is hereby defined a a regular meeting of three or more student permission to reform may be sought from the high inquisitor professor umbridge no student organization society team group or club may exist without the knowledge and approval of the high inquisitor any student found to have formed or to belong to an organization society team group or club that ha not been approved by the high inquisitor will be expelled the above is in accordance with educational decree number twentyfour signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor harry and ron read the notice over the head of some anxiouslooking second year doe this mean they are going to shut down the gobstones club one of them asked his friend i reckon you will be okay with gobstones ron said darkly making the second year jump i do not think were going to be a lucky though do you he asked harry a the second year hurried away page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry wa reading the notice through again the happiness that had filled him since saturday wa gone his inside were pulsing with rage this is not a coincidence he said his hand forming fist she know she can not said ron at once there were people listening in that pub and let u face it we do not know how many of the people who turned up we can trust any of them could have run off and told umbridge and he had thought they believed him thought they even admired him zacharias smith said ron at once punching a fist into his hand or i thought that michael corner had a really shifty look too i wonder if hermiones seen this yet harry said looking around at the door to the girl dormitory let u go and tell her said ron he bounded forward pulled open the door and set off up the spiral staircase he wa on the sixth stair when it happened there wa a loud wailing klaxonlike sound and the step melted together to make a long smooth stone slide there wa a brief moment when ron tried to keep running arm working madly like windmill then he toppled over backward and shot down the newly created slide coming to rest on his back at harrys foot page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling er i do not think were allowed in the girl dormitory said harry pulling ron to his foot and trying not to laugh two fourthyear girl came zooming gleefully down the stone slide oooh who tried to get upstairs they giggled happily leaping to their foot and ogling harry and ron me said ron who wa still rather disheveled i did not realize that would happen it not fair he added to harry a the girl headed off for the portrait hole still giggling madly hermiones allowed in our dormitory how come were not allowed well it an oldfashioned rule said hermione who had just slid neatly onto a rug in front of them and wa now getting to her foot but it say in hogwarts a history that the founder thought boy were le trustworthy than girl anyway why were you trying to get in there to see you look at this said ron dragging her over to the notice board hermiones eye slid rapidly down the notice her expression became stony someone must have blabbed to her ron said angrily they can not have done said hermione in a low voice you are so naive said ron you think just because you are all honorable and trustworthy page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no they can not have done because i put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed said hermione grimly believe me if anyones run off and told umbridge well know exactly who they are and they will really regret it what will happen to them said ron eagerly well put it this way said hermione it will make eloise midgens acne look like a couple of cute freckle come on let u get down to breakfast and see what the others think i wonder whether this ha been put up in all the house it wa immediately apparent on entering the great hall that umbridges sign had not only appeared in gryffindor tower there wa a peculiar intensity about the chatter and an extra measure of movement in the hall a people scurried up and down their table conferring on what they had read harry ron and hermione had barely taken their seat when neville dean fred george and ginny descended upon them did you see it dyou reckon she know what are we going to do they were all looking at harry he glanced around to make sure there were no teacher near them were going to do it anyway of course he said quietly knew you would say that said george beaming and thumping harry on the arm page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the prefect a well said fred looking quizzically at ron and hermione of course said hermione coolly here come ernie and hannah abbott said ron looking over his shoulder and those ravenclaw bloke and smith and no one look very spotty hermione looked alarmed never mind spot the idiot can not come over here now it will look really suspicious sit down she mouthed to ernie and hannah gesturing frantically to them to rejoin the hufflepuff table later well talk to you lateri ill tell michael said ginny impatiently swinging herself off her bench the fool honestly she hurried off toward the ravenclaw table harry watched her go cho wa sitting not far away talking to the curlyhaired friend she had brought along to the hog head would umbridges notice scare her off meeting them again but the full repercussion of the sign were not felt until they were leaving the great hall for history of magic harry ron it wa angelina and she wa hurrying toward them looking perfectly desperate it okay said harry quietly when she wa near enough to hear him were still going to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you realize she is including quidditch in this angelina said over him we have to go and ask permission to reform the gryffindor team what said harry no way said ron appalled you read the sign it mention team too so listen harry i am saying this for the last time please please do not lose your temper with umbridge again or she might not let u play anymore okay okay said harry for angelina looked a though she wa on the verge of tear do not worry ill behave myself bet umbridge is in history of magic said ron grimly a they set off for binnss lesson she ha not inspected binns yet bet you anything she is there but he wa wrong the only teacher present when they entered wa professor binns floating an inch or so above his chair a usual and preparing to continue his monotonous drone on giant war harry did not even attempt to follow what he wa saying today he doodled idly on his parchment ignoring hermiones frequent glare and nudge until a particularly painful poke in the rib made him look up angrily what she pointed at the window harry looked around hedwig wa perched on the narrow window ledge gazing through the thick glass at him a letter tied to her leg harry could not understand it they had just had breakfast why on earth had not she delivered the letter then a usual many of his classmate were pointing out hedwig to each other too page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh i have always loved that owl she is so beautiful harry heard lavender sigh to parvati he glanced around at professor binns who continued to read his note serenely unaware that the class attention wa even le focused upon him than usual harry slipped quietly off his chair crouched down and hurried along the row to the window where he slid the catch and opened it very slowly he had expected hedwig to hold out her leg so that he could remove the letter and then fly off to the owlery but the moment the window wa open wide enough she hopped inside hooting dolefully he closed the window with an anxious glance at professor binns crouched low again and sped back to his seat with hedwig on his shoulder he regained his seat transferred hedwig to his lap and made to remove the letter tied to her leg it wa only then that he realized that hedwigs feather were oddly ruffled some were bent the wrong way and she wa holding one of her wing at an odd angle she is hurt harry whispered bending his head low over her hermione and ron leaned in closer hermione even put down her quill look there is something wrong with her wing hedwig wa quivering when harry made to touch the wing she gave a little jump all her feather on end a though she wa inflating herself and gazed at him reproachfully professor binns said harry loudly and everyone in the class turned to look at him i am not feeling well page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor binns raised his eye from his note looking amazed a always to find the room in front of him full of people not feeling well he repeated hazily not at all well said harry firmly getting to his foot while concealing hedwig behind his back so i think ill need to go to the hospital wing yes said professor binns clearly very much wrong footed yes yes hospital wing well off you go then perkins once outside the room harry returned hedwig to his shoulder and hurried off up the corridor pausing to think only when he wa out of sight of binnss door his first choice of somebody to cure hedwig would have been hagrid of course but a he had no idea where hagrid wa his only remaining option wa to find professor grubblyplank and hope she would help he peered out of a window at the blustery overcast ground there wa no sign of her anywhere near hagrids cabin if she wa not teaching she wa probably in the staffroom he set off downstairs hedwig hooting feebly a she swayed on his shoulder two stone gargoyle flanked the staffroom door a harry approached one of them croaked you should be in class sunny jim this is urgent said harry curtly ooooh urgent is it said the other gargoyle in a highpitched voice well that is put u in our place ha not it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry knocked he heard footstep and then the door opened and he found himself facetoface with professor mcgonagall you have not been given another detention she said at once her square spectacle flashing alarmingly no professor said harry hastily well then why are you out of class it urgent apparently said the second gargoyle snidely i am looking for professor grubblyplank harry explained it my owl she is injured injured owl did you say professor grubblyplank appeared at professor mcgonagalls shoulder smoking a pipe and holding a copy of the daily prophet yes said harry lifting hedwig carefully off his shoulder she turned up after the other post owl and her wing all funny look professor grubblyplank stuck her pipe firmly between her teeth and took hedwig from harry while professor mcgonagall watched hmm said professor grubblyplank her pipe waggling slightly a she talked look like something is attacked her can not think what would have done it though thestrals will sometimes go for bird of course but hagrids got the hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owl page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry neither knew nor cared what thestrals were he just wanted to know that hedwig wa going to be all right professor mcgonagall however looked sharply at harry and said do you know how far this owl traveled potter er said harry from london i think he met her eye briefly and knew that she understood london to mean number twelve grimmauld place by the way her eyebrow had joined in the middle professor grubblyplank pulled a monocle out of the inside of her robe and screwed it into her eye to examine hedwigs wing closely i should be able to sort this out if you leave her with me potter she said she should not be flying long distance for a few day in any case er right thanks said harry just a the bell rang for break no problem said professor grubblyplank gruffly turning back into the staffroom just a moment wilhelmina said professor mcgonagall potter letter oh yeah said harry who had momentarily forgotten the scroll tied to hedwigs leg professor grubblyplank handed it over and then disappeared into the staffroom carrying hedwig who wa staring at harry a though unable to believe he would give her away like this feeling slightly guilty he turned to go but professor mcgonagall called him back potter yes professor page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she glanced up and down the corridor there were student coming from both direction bear in mind she said quickly and quietly her eye on the scroll in his hand that channel of communication in and out of hogwarts may be being watched will not you i said harry but the flood of student rolling along the corridor wa almost upon him professor mcgonagall gave him a curt nod and retreated into the staffroom leaving harry to be swept out into the courtyard with the crowd here he spotted ron and hermione already standing in a sheltered corner their cloak collar turned up against the wind harry slit open the scroll a he hurried toward them and found five word in sirius handwriting today same time same place is hedwig okay asked hermione anxiously the moment he wa within earshot where did you take her asked ron to grubblyplank said harry and i met mcgonagall listen and he told them what professor mcgonagall had said to his surprise neither of the others looked shocked on the contrary they exchanged significant look what said harry looking from ron to hermione and back again well i wa just saying to ron what if someone had tried to intercept hedwig i mean she is never been hurt on a flight before ha she page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling who is the letter from anyway asked ron taking the note from harry snuffle said harry quietly same time same place doe he mean the fire in the common room obviously said hermione also reading the note she looked uneasy i just hope nobody else ha read this but it wa still sealed and everything said harry trying to convince himself a much a her and nobody would understand what it meant if they did not know where wed spoken to him before would they i do not know said hermione anxiously hitching her bag back over her shoulder a the bell rang again it would not be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic and if anyones watching the floo network but i do not really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too they trudged down the stone step to the dungeon for potion all three of them lost in thought but a they reached the bottom of the stair they were recalled to themselves by the voice of draco malfoy who wa standing just outside snapes classroom door waving around an officiallooking piece of parchment and talking much louder than wa necessary so that they could hear every word yeah umbridge gave the slytherin quidditch team permission to continue playing straightaway i went to ask her first thing this morning well it wa pretty much automatic i mean she know my father really well he always popping in and out of the ministry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it will be interesting to see whether gryffindor are allowed to keep playing will not it do not rise hermione whispered imploringly to harry and ron who were both watching malfoy face set and fist clenched it what he want i mean said malfoy raising his voice a little more his gray eye glittering malevolently in harry and ron direction if it a question of influence with the ministry i do not think they have got much chance from what my father say they have been looking for an excuse to sack arthur weasley for year and a for potter my father say it a matter of time before the ministry ha him carted off to st mungos apparently they have got a special ward for people whose brain have been addled by magic malfoy made a grotesque face his mouth sagging open and his eye rolling crabbe and goyle gave their usual grunt of laughter pansy parkinson shrieked with glee something collided hard with harrys shoulder knocking him sideways a split second later he realized that neville had just charged past him heading straight for malfoy neville no harry leapt forward and seized the back of nevilles robe neville struggled frantically his fist flailing trying desperately to get at malfoy who looked for a moment extremely shocked help me harry flung at ron managing to get an arm around nevilles neck and dragging him backward away from the slytherins crabbe and goyle were now flexing their arm closing in front of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling malfoy ready for the fight ron hurried forward and seized nevilles arm together he and harry succeeded in dragging neville back into the gryffindor line nevilles face wa scarlet the pressure harry wa exerting on his throat rendered him quite incomprehensible but odd word spluttered from his mouth not funny do not mungos show him the dungeon door opened snape appeared there his black eye swept up the gryffindor line to the point where harry and ron were wrestling with neville fighting potter weasley longbottom snape said in his cold sneering voice ten point from gryffindor release longbottom potter or it will be detention inside all of you harry let go of neville who stood panting and glaring at him i had to stop you harry gasped picking up his bag crabbe and goyle would have torn you apart neville said nothing he merely snatched up his own bag and stalked off into the dungeon what in the name of merlin said ron slowly a they followed neville wa that about harry did not answer he knew exactly why the subject of people who were in st mungos because of magical damage to their brain wa highly distressing to neville but he had sworn to dumbledore that he would not tell anyone nevilles secret even neville did not know that harry knew page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry ron and hermione took their usual seat at the back of the class and pulled out parchment quill and their copy of one thousand magical herb and fungi the class around them wa whispering about what neville had just done but when snape closed the dungeon door with an echoing bang everybody fell silent immediately you will notice said snape in his low sneering voice that we have a guest with u today he gestured toward the dim corner of the dungeon and harry saw professor umbridge sitting there clipboard on her knee he glanced sideways at ron and hermione his eyebrow raised snape and umbridge the two teacher he hated most it wa hard to decide which he wanted to triumph over the other we are continuing with our strengthening solution today you will find your mixture a you left them last lesson if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend instruction he waved his wand again on the board carry on professor umbridge spent the first half hour of the lesson making note in her corner harry wa very interested in hearing her question snape so interested that he wa becoming careless with his potion again salamander blood harry hermione moaned grabbing his wrist to prevent him adding the wrong ingredient for the third time not pomegranate juice right said harry vaguely putting down the bottle and continuing to watch the corner umbridge had just gotten to her foot ha he said softly a she page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling strode between two line of desk toward snape who wa bending over dean thomas cauldron well the class seems fairly advanced for their level she said briskly to snape s back though i would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the strengthening solution i think the ministry would prefer it if that wa removed from the syllabus snape straightened up slowly and turned to look at her now how long have you been teaching at hogwarts she asked her quill poised over her clipboard fourteen year snape replied his expression wa unfathomable his eye on snape harry added a few drop to his potion it hissed menacingly and turned from turquoise to orange you applied first for the defense against the dark art post i believe professor umbridge asked snape yes said snape quietly but you were unsuccessful snape s lip curled obviously professor umbridge scribbled on her clipboard and you have applied regularly for the defense against the dark art post since you first joined the school i believe page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes said snape quietly barely moving his lip he looked very angry do you have any idea why dumbledore ha consistently refused to appoint you asked umbridge i suggest you ask him said snape jerkily oh i shall said professor umbridge with a sweet smile i suppose this is relevant snape asked his black eye narrowed oh yes said professor umbridge yes the ministry want a thorough understanding of teacher er background she turned away walked over to pansy parkinson and began questioning her about the lesson snape looked around at harry and their eye met for a second harry hastily dropped his gaze to his potion which wa now congealing foully and giving off a strong smell of burned rubber no mark again then potter said snape maliciously emptying harrys cauldron with a wave of his wand you will write me an essay on the correct composition of this potion indicating how and why you went wrong to be handed in next lesson do you understand yes said harry furiously snape had already given them homework and he had quidditch practice this evening this would mean another couple of sleepless night it did not seem possible that he had awoken that morning feeling very happy all he felt now wa a fervent desire for this day to end a soon a possible page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling maybe ill skive off divination he said glumly a they stood again in the courtyard after lunch the wind whipping at the hem of robe and brim of hat ill pretend to be ill and do snapes essay instead then i will not have to stay up half the night you can not skive off divination said hermione severely hark who is talking you walked out of divination you hate trelawney said ron indignantly i do not hate her said hermione loftily i just think she is an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud but harrys already missed history of magic and i do not think he ought to miss anything else today there wa too much truth in this to ignore so half an hour later harry took his seat in the hot over perfumed atmosphere of the divination classroom feeling angry at everybody professor trelawney wa handing out copy of the dream oracle yet again he would surely be much better employed doing snapes punishment essay than sitting here trying to find meaning in a lot of madeup dream it seemed however that he wa not the only person in divination who wa in a temper professor trelawney slammed a copy of the oracle down on the table between harry and ron and swept away her lip pursed she threw the next copy of the oracle at seamus and dean narrowly avoiding seamuss head and thrust the final one into nevilles chest with such force that he slipped off his pouf well carry on said professor trelawney loudly her voice high pitched and somewhat hysterical you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling know what to do or am i such a substandard teacher that you have never learned how to open a book the class stared perplexedly at her and then at each other harry however thought he knew what wa the matter a professor trelawney flounced back to the highbacked teacher chair her magnified eye full of angry tear he leaned his head closer to ron and muttered i think she is got the result of her inspection back professor said parvati patil in a hushed voice she and lavender had always rather admired professor trelawney professor is there anything er wrong wrong cried professor trelawney in a voice throbbing with emotion certainly not i have been insulted certainly insinuation have been made against me unfounded accusation levelled but no there is nothing wrong certainly not she took a great shuddering breath and looked away from parvati angry tear spilling from under her glass i say nothing she choked of sixteen year devoted service it ha passed apparently unnoticed but i shall not be insulted no i shall not but professor who is insulting you asked parvati timidly the establishment said professor trelawney in a deep dramatic wavering voice yes those with eye too clouded by the mundane to see a i see to know a i know of course we seer have always been feared always persecuted it is ala our fate page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she gulped dabbed at her wet cheek with the end of her shawl and then pulled a small embroidered handkerchief from her sleeve into which she blew her nose very hard with a sound like peeve blowing a raspberry ron sniggered lavender shot him a disgusted look professor said parvati do you mean is it something professor umbridge do not speak to me about that woman cried professor trelawney leaping to her foot her bead rattling and her spectacle flashing kindly continue with your work and she spent the rest of the lesson striding among them tear still leaking from behind her glass muttering what sounded like threat under her breath may well choose to leave the indignity of it on probation we shall see how she dare you and umbridge have got something in common harry told hermione quietly when they met again in defense against the dark art she obviously reckons trelawneys an old fraud too look like she is put her on probation umbridge entered the room a he spoke wearing her black velvet bow and an expression of great smugness good afternoon class good afternoon professor umbridge they chanted drearily wand away please page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but there wa no answering flurry of movement this time nobody had bothered to take out their wand please turn to page thirtyfour of defensive magical theory and read the third chapter entitled the case for nonoffensive response to magical attack there will be no need to talk harry ron and hermione said together under their breath no quidditch practice said angelina in hollow tone when harry ron and hermione entered the common room that night after dinner but i kept my temper said harry horrified i did not say anything to her angelina i swear i i know i know said angelina miserably she just said she needed a bit of time to consider consider what said ron angrily she is given the slytherins permission why not u but harry could imagine how much umbridge wa enjoying holding the threat of no gryffindor quidditch team over their head and could easily understand why she would not want to relinquish that weapon over them too soon well said hermione look on the bright side at least now you will have time to do snapes essay that is a bright side is it snapped harry while ron stared incredulously at hermione no quidditch practice and extra potion harry slumped down into a chair dragged his potion essay reluctantly from his bag and set to work page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa very hard to concentrate even though he knew that sirius wa not due in the fire until much later he could not help glancing into the flame every few minute just in case there wa also an incredible amount of noise in the room fred and george appeared finally to have perfected one type of skiving snackbox which they were taking turn to demonstrate to a cheering and whooping crowd first fred would take a bite out of the orange end of a chew at which he would vomit spectacularly into a bucket they had placed in front of them then he would force down the purple end of the chew at which the vomiting would immediately cease lee jordan who wa assisting the demonstration wa lazily vanishing the vomit at regular interval with the same vanishing spell snape kept using on harrys potion what with the regular sound of retching cheering and fred and george taking advance order from the crowd harry wa finding it exceptionally difficult to focus on the correct method for strengthening solution hermione wa not helping matter the cheer and sound of vomit hitting the bottom of fred and george bucket were punctuated by loud and disapproving sniff that harry found if anything more distracting just go and stop them then he said irritably after crossing out the wrong weight of powdered griffin claw for the fourth time i can not they are not technically doing anything wrong said hermione through gritted teeth they are quite within their right to eat the foul thing themselves and i can not find a rule that say the other idiot are not entitled to buy them not unless they are proven to be page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dangerous in some way and it doe not look a though they are she harry and ron watched george projectilevomit into the bucket gulp down the rest of the chew and straighten up beaming with his arm wide to protracted applause you know i do not get why fred and george only got three owl each said harry watching a fred george and lee collected gold from the eager crowd they really know their stuff oh they only know flashy stuff that is no real use to anyone said hermione disparagingly no real use said ron in a strained voice hermione they have got about twentysix galleon already it wa a long while before the crowd around the weasleys dispersed and then fred lee and george sat up counting their taking even longer so that it wa well past midnight when harry ron and hermione finally had the common room to themselves again at long last fred closed the doorway to the boy dormitory behind him rattling his box of galleon ostentatiously so that hermione scowled harry who wa making very little progress with his potion essay decided to give it up for the night a he put his book away ron who wa dozing lightly in an armchair gave a muffled grunt awoke looked blearily into the fire and said sirius harry whipped around sirius untidy dark head wa sitting in the fire again hi he said grinning page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hi chorused harry ron and hermione all three kneeling down upon the hearthrug crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire trying despite the heat to put his face close to sirius how are thing said sirius not that good said harry a hermione pulled crookshanks back to stop him singeing his whisker the ministry forced through another decree which mean were not allowed to have quidditch team or secret defense against the dark art group said sirius there wa a short pause how did you know about that harry demanded you want to choose your meeting place more carefully said sirius grinning still more broadly the hog head i ask you well it wa better than the three broomstick said hermione defensively that is always packed with people which mean you would have been harder to overhear said sirius you have got a lot to learn hermione who overheard u harry demanded mundungus of course said sirius and when they all looked puzzled he laughed he wa the witch under the veil that wa mundungus harry said stunned what wa he doing in the hog head page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what do you think he wa doing said sirius impatiently keeping an eye on you of course i am still being followed asked harry angrily yeah you are said sirius and just a well is not it if the first thing you are going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal defense group but he looked neither angry nor worried on the contrary he wa looking at harry with distinct pride why wa dung hiding from u asked ron sounding disappointed we would have liked to have seen him he wa banned from the hog head twenty year ago said sirius and that barman got a long memory we lost moody spare invisibility cloak when sturgis wa arrested so dung been dressing a a witch a lot lately anyway first of all ron i have sworn to pas on a message from your mother oh yeah said ron sounding apprehensive she say on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret defense against the dark art group she say you will be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined she say there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now she also sirius eye turned to the other two advises harry and hermione not to proceed with the group though she accepts that she ha no authority over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she ha their best interest at heart she would have written all this to you but if the owl had been intercepted you would all have been in real trouble and she can not say it for herself because she is on duty tonight page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling on duty doing what said ron quickly never you mind just stuff for the order said sirius so it fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her i passed it all on because i do not think she trust me to there wa another pause in which crookshanks mewing attempted to paw sirius head and ron fiddled with a hole in the hearthrug so you want me to say i am not going to take part in the defense group he muttered finally me certainly not said sirius looking surprised i think it an excellent idea you do said harry his heart lifting of course i do said sirius dyou think your father and i would have lain down and taken order from an old hag like umbridge but last term all you did wa tell me to be careful and not take risk last year all the evidence wa that someone inside hogwarts wa trying to kill you harry said sirius impatiently this year we know that there is someone outside hogwarts who would like to kill u all so i think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea and if we do get expelled hermione asked a quizzical look on her face hermione this whole thing wa your idea said harry staring at her page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i know it wa i just wondered what sirius thought she said shrugging well better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue said sirius hear hear said harry and ron enthusiastically so said sirius how are you organizing this group where are you meeting well that is a bit of a problem now said harry do not know where were going to be able to go how about the shrieking shack suggested sirius hey that is an idea said ron excitedly but hermione made a skeptical noise and all three of them looked at her sirius head turning in the flame well sirius it just that there were only four of you meeting in the shrieking shack when you were at school said hermione and all of you could transform into animal and i suppose you could all have squeezed under a single invisibility cloak if you would wanted to but there are twentyeight of u and none of u is an animagus so we would not need so much an invisibility cloak a an invisibility marquee fair point said sirius looking slightly crestfallen well i am sure you will come up with somewhere there used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor you might have enough space to practice jinx in there page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fred and george told me it blocked said harry shaking his head caved in or something oh said sirius frowning well have a think and get back to he broke off his face wa suddenly tense alarmed he turned sideways apparently looking into the solid brick wall of the fireplace sirius said harry anxiously but he had vanished harry gaped at the flame for a moment then turned to look at ron and hermione why did he hermione gave a horrified gasp and leapt to her foot still staring at the fire a hand had appeared amongst the flame groping a though to catch hold of something a stubby short fingered hand covered in ugly oldfashioned ring the three of them ran for it at the door of the boy dormitory harry looked back umbridges hand wa still making snatching movement amongst the flame a though she knew exactly where sirius hair had been moment before and wa determined to seize it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dumbledores army umbridge ha been reading your mail harry there is no other explanation you think umbridge attacked hedwig he said outraged i am almost certain of it said hermione grimly watch your frog it escaping harry pointed his wand at the bullfrog that had been hopping hopefully toward the other side of the table acciol and it zoomed gloomily back into his hand charm wa always one of the best lesson in which to enjoy a private chat there wa generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard wa very slight today with the room full of croaking bullfrog and cawing raven and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom window harry ron and hermione s whispered discussion about how page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling umbridge had nearly caught sirius went quite unnoticed i have been suspecting this ever since filch accused you of ordering dungbombs because it seemed such a stupid lie hermione whispered i mean once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you were not ordering them so you would not have been in trouble at all it a bit of a feeble joke is not it but then i thought what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail well then it would be a perfect way for umbridge to manage it tip off filch let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it i do not think filch would object when is he ever stuck up for a student right harry you are squashing your frog harry looked down he wa indeed squeezing his bullfrog so tightly it eye were popping he replaced it hastily upon the desk it wa a very very close call last night said hermione i just wonder if umbridge know how close it wa silenciol the bullfrog on which she wa practicing her silencing charm wa struck dumb midcroak and glared at her reproachfully if she would caught snuffle harry finished the sentence for her he would probably be back in azkaban this morning he waved his wand without really concentrating his bullfrog swelled like a green balloon and emitted a highpitched whistle page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling silenciol said hermione hastily pointing her wand at harrys frog which deflated silently before them well he must not do it again that is all i just do not know how were going to let him know we can not send him an owl i do not reckon hell risk it again said ron he not stupid he know she nearly got him silenciol the large and ugly raven in front of him let out a derisive caw silenciol silencio the raven cawed more loudly it the way you are moving your wand said hermione watching ron critically you do not want to wave it it more a sharp jab raven are harder than frog said ron testily fine let u swap said hermione seizing ron raven and replacing it with her own fat bullfrog silencio the raven continued to open and close it sharp beak but no sound came out very good miss granger said professor flitwicks squeaky little voice and harry ron and hermione all jumped now let me see you try mr weasley wha oh oh right said ron very flustered er silenciol he jabbed at the bullfrog so hard that he poked it in the eye the frog gave a deafening croak and leapt off the desk page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it came a no surprise to any of them that harry and ron were given additional practice of the silencing charm for homework they were allowed to remain inside over break due to the downpour outside they found seat in a noisy and overcrowded classroom on the first floor in which peeve wa floating dreamily up near the chandelier occasionally blowing an ink pellet at the top of somebody is head they had barely sat down when angelina came struggling toward them through the group of gossiping student i have got permission she said to reform the quidditch team excellent said ron and harry together yeah said angelina beaming i went to mcgonagall and i think she might have appealed to dumbledore anyway umbridge had to give in ha so i want you down at the pitch at seven of the clock tonight all right because we have got to make up time you realize were only three week away from our first match she squeezed away from them narrowly dodged an ink pellet from peeve which hit a nearby first year instead and vanished from sight ron smile slipped slightly a he looked out of the window which wa now opaque with hammering rain hope this clear up what is up with you hermione page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she too wa gazing at the window but not a though she really saw it her eye were unfocused and there wa a frown on her face just thinking she said still frowning at the rain washed window about siri snuffle said harry no not exactly said hermione slowly more wondering i suppose were doing the right thing i think are not we harry and ron looked at each other well that clear that up said ron it would have been really annoying if you had not explained yourself properly hermione looked at him a though she had only just realized he wa there i wa just wondering she said her voice stronger now whether were doing the right thing starting this defense against the dark art group what said harry and ron together hermione it wa your idea in the first place said ron indignantly i know said hermione twisting her finger together but after talking to snuffle but he all for it said harry yes said hermione staring at the window again yes that is what made me think maybe it wa not a good idea after all page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling peeve floated over them on his stomach peashooter at the ready automatically all three of them lifted their bag to cover their head until he had passed let u get this straight said harry angrily a they put their bag back on the floor sirius agrees with u so you do not think we should do it anymore hermione looked tense and rather miserable now staring at her own hand she said do you honestly trust his judgment yes i do said harry at once he always given u great advice an ink pellet whizzed past them striking katie bell squarely in the ear hermione watched katie leap to her foot and start throwing thing at peeve it wa a few moment before hermione spoke again and it sounded a though she wa choosing her word very carefully you do not think he ha become sort of reckless since he been cooped up in grimmauld place you do not think he kind of living through u what dyou mean living through u harry retorted i mean well i think he would love to be forming secret defense society right under the nose of someone from the ministry i think he really frustrated at how little he can do where he is so i think he keen to kind of egg u on ron looked utterly perplexed sirius is right he said you do sound just like my mother page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hermione bit her lip and did not answer the bell rang just a peeve swooped down upon katie and emptied an entire ink bottle over her head the weather did not improve a the day wore on so that at seven of the clock that evening when harry and ron went down to the quidditch pitch for practice they were soaked through within minute their foot slipping and sliding on the sodden grass the sky wa a deep thundery gray and it wa a relief to gain the warmth and light of the changing room even if they knew the respite wa only temporary they found fred and george debating whether to use one of their own skiving snackboxes to get out of flying but i bet she would know what wed done fred said out of the corner of his mouth if only i had not offered to sell her some puking pastille yesterday we could try the fever fudge george muttered no one seen that yet doe it work inquired ron hopefully a the hammering of rain on the roof intensified and wind howled around the building well yeah said fred your temperaturell go right up but you get these massive pusfilled boil too said george and we have not worked out how to get rid of them yet i can not see any boil said ron staring at the twin no well you would not said fred darkly they are not in a place we generally display to the public page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the all right everyone listen up said angelina loudly emerging from the captain office i know it not ideal weather but there is a good chance well be playing slytherin in condition like this so it a good idea to work out how were going to cope with them harry did not you do something to your glass to stop the rain fogging them up when we played hufflepuff in that storm hermione did it said harry he pulled out his wand tapped his glass and said imperviusl i think we all ought to try that said angelina if we could just keep the rain off our face it would really help visibility all together come on imperviusl okay let u go they all stowed their wand back in the inside pocket of their robe shouldered their broom and followed angelina out of the changing room they squelched through the deepening mud to the middle of the pitch visibility wa still very poor even with the impervius charm light wa fading fast and curtain of rain were sweeping the ground all right on my whistle shouted angelina harry kicked off from the ground spraying mud in all direction and shot upward the wind pulling him slightly off course he had no idea how he wa going to see the snitch in this weather he wa having enough difficulty seeing the one bludger with which they were practicing a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the sloth grip roll to avoid it unfortunately angelina did not page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling see this in fact she did not appear to be able to see anything none of them had a clue what the others were doing the wind wa picking up even at a distance harry could hear the swishing pounding sound of the rain pummeling the surface of the lake angelina kept them at it for nearly an hour before conceding defeat she led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing room insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time though without any real conviction in her voice fred and george were looking particularly annoyed both were bandylegged and winced with every movement harry could hear them complaining in low voice a he toweled his hair dry i think a few of mine have ruptured said fred in a hollow voice mine have not said george wincing they are throbbing like mad feel bigger if anything ouch said harry he pressed the towel to his face his eye screwed tight with pain the scar on his forehead had seared again more painfully than in month what is up said several voice harry emerged from behind his towel the changing room wa blurred because he wa not wearing his glass but he could still tell that everyone is face wa turned toward him nothing he muttered i poked myself in the eye that is all page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but he gave ron a significant look and the two of them hung back a the rest of the team filed back outside muffled in their cloak their hat pulled low over their ear what happened said ron the moment that alicia had disappeared through the door wa it your scar harry nodded but looking scared ron strode across to the window and stared out into the rain he he can not be near u now can he no harry muttered sinking onto a bench and rubbing his forehead he probably mile away it hurt because he angry harry had not meant to say that at all and heard the word a though a stranger had spoken them yet he knew at once that they were true he did not know how he knew it but he did voldemort wherever he wa whatever he wa doing wa in a towering temper did you see him said ron looking horrified did you get a vision or something harry sat quite still staring at his foot allowing his mind and his memory to relax in the aftermath of the pain a confused tangle of shape a howling rush of voice he want something done and it not happening fast enough he said page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling again he felt surprised to hear the word coming out of his mouth and yet quite certain that they were true but how do you know said ron harry shook his head and covered his eye with his hand pressing down upon them with his palm little star erupted in them he felt ron sit down on the bench beside him and knew ron wa staring at him is this what it wa about last time said ron in a hushed voice when your scar hurt in umbridges office youknowwho wa angry harry shook his head what is it then harry wa thinking himself back he had been looking into umbridges face his scar had hurt and he had had that odd feeling in his stomach a strange leaping feeling a happy feeling but of course he had not recognized it for what it wa a he had been feeling so miserable himself last time it wa because he wa pleased he said really pleased he thought something good wa going to happen and the night before we came back to hogwarts he thought back to the moment when his scar had hurt so badly in his and ron bedroom in grimmauld place he wa furious he looked around at ron who wa gaping at him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you could take over from trelawney mate he said in an awed voice i am not making prophecy said harry no you know what you are doing ron said sounding both scared and impressed harry you are reading youknowwhos mind no said harry shaking his head it more like his mood i suppose i am just getting flash of what mood he in dumbledore said something like this wa happening last year he said that when voldemort wa near me or when he wa feeling hatred i could tell well now i am feeling it when he pleased too there wa a pause the wind and rain lashed at the building you have got to tell someone said ron i told sirius last time well tell him about this time can not can i said harry grimly umbridge is watching the owl and the fire remember well then dumbledore i have just told you he already know said harry shortly getting to his foot taking his cloak off his peg and swinging it around himself there is no point telling him again ron did up the fastening of his own cloak watching harry thoughtfully page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dumbledored want to know he said harry shrugged cmon we have still got silencing charm to practice they hurried back through the dark ground sliding and stumbling up the muddy lawn not talking harry wa thinking hard what wa it that voldemort wanted done that wa not happening quickly enough he got other plan plan he can put into operation very quietly indeed stuff he can only get by stealth like a weapon something he did not have last time he had not thought about those word in week he had been too absorbed in what wa going on at hogwarts too busy dwelling on the ongoing battle with umbridge the injustice of all the ministry interference but now they came back to him and made him wonder voldemorts anger would make sense if he wa no nearer laying hand on the weapon whatever it wa had the order thwarted him stopped him from seizing it where wa it kept who had it now mimbulus mimbletonia said ron voice and harry came back to his sens just in time to clamber through the portrait hole into the common room it appeared that hermione had gone to bed early leaving crookshanks curled in a nearby chair and an assortment of knobbly knitted elf hat lying on a table by the fire harry wa rather grateful that she wa not around because he did not much want to discus his scar hurting and have her urge him to go to dumbledore too ron kept throwing him anxious glance but harry pulled out his potion book and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling set to work to finish his essay though he wa only pretending to concentrate and by the time that ron said he wa going to bed too had written hardly anything midnight came and went while harry wa reading and rereading a passage about the us of scurvygrass lovage and sneezewort and not taking in a word of it these plantes are moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used in confusing and befuddlement draught where the wizard is desirous of producing hotheadedness and recklessness hermione said sirius wa becoming reckless cooped up in grimmauld place moste efficacious in the inflaming of the braine and are therefore much used the daily prophet would think his brain wa inflamed if they found out that he knew what voldemort wa feeling therefore much used in confusing and befuddlement draught confusing wa the word all right why did he know what voldemort wa feeling what wa this weird connection between them which dumbledore had never been able to explain satisfactorily where the wizard is desirous how he would like to sleep of producing hotheadedness page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa warm and comfortable in his armchair before the fire with the rain still beating heavily on the windowpane and crookshanks purring and the crackling of the flame the book slipped from harrys slack grip and landed with a dull thud on the hearthrug his head fell sideways he wa walking once more along a windowless corridor his footstep echoing in the silence a the door at the end of the passage loomed larger his heart beat fast with excitement if he could only open it enter beyond he stretched out his hand his fingertip were inch from it harry potter sir he awoke with a start the candle had all been extinguished in the common room but there wa something moving close by whozair said harry sitting upright in his chair the fire wa almost extinguished the room very dark dobby ha your owl sir said a squeaky voice dobby said harry thickly peering through the gloom toward the source of the voice dobby the houseelf wa standing beside the table on which hermione had left her half a dozen knitted hat his large pointed ear were now sticking out from beneath what looked like all the hat that hermione had ever knitted he wa wearing one on top of the other so that his head seemed elongated by page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling two or three foot and on the very topmost bobble sat hedwig hooting serenely and obviously cured dobby volunteered to return harry potter owl said the elf squeakily with a look of positive adoration on his face professor grubblyplank say she is all well now sir he sank into a deep bow so that his pencillike nose brushed the threadbare surface of the hearthrug and hedwig gave an indignant hoot and fluttered onto the arm of harrys chair thanks dobby said harry stroking hedwigs head and blinking hard trying to rid himself of the image of the door in his dream it had been very vivid looking back at dobby he noticed that the elf wa also wearing several scarf and innumerable sock so that his foot looked far too big for his body er have you been taking all the clothes hermiones been leaving out oh no sir said dobby happily dobby ha been taking some for winky too sir yeah how is winky asked harry dobbys ear drooped slightly winky is still drinking lot sir he said sadly his enormous round green eye large a tennis ball downcast she still doe not care for clothes harry potter nor do the other houseelves none of them will clean gryffindor tower anymore not with the hat and sock hidden everywhere they find them insulting sir dobby doe it all himself sir but dobby doe not mind sir for he always hope to meet harry potter and tonight sir he ha got his wish page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dobby sank into a deep bow again but harry potter doe not seem happy dobby went on straightening up again and looking timidly at harry dobby heard him muttering in his sleep wa harry potter having bad dream not really bad said harry yawning and rubbing his eye i have had worse the elf surveyed harry out of his vast orblike eye then he said very seriously his ear drooping dobby wish he could help harry potter for harry potter set dobby free and dobby is much much happier now harry smiled you can not help me dobby but thanks for the offer he bent and picked up his potion book he would have to try and finish the essay tomorrow he closed the book and a he did so the firelight illuminated the thin white scar on the back of his hand the result of his detention with umbridge wait a moment there is something you can do for me dobby said harry slowly the elf looked around beaming name it harry potter sir i need to find a place where twentyeight people can practice defense against the dark art without being discovered by any of the teacher especially harry clenched his hand on the book so that the scar shone pearly white professor umbridge page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he expected the elf smile to vanish his ear to droop he expected him to say that this wa impossible or else that he would try but his hope were not high what he had not expected wa for dobby to give a little skip his ear waggling happily and clap his hand together dobby know the perfect place sir he said happily dobby heard tell of it from the other houseelves when he came to hogwarts sir it is known by u a the come and go room sir or else a the room of requirement why said harry curiously because it is a room that a person can only enter said dobby seriously when they have real need of it sometimes it is there and sometimes it is not but when it appears it is always equipped for the seeker need dobby ha used it sir said the elf dropping his voice and looking guilty when winky ha been very drunk he ha hidden her in the room of requirement and he ha found antidote to butterbeer there and a nice elfsized bed to settle her on while she sleep it off sir and dobby know mr filch ha found extra cleaning material there when he ha run short sir and and if you really needed a bathroom said harry suddenly remembering something dumbledore had said at the yule ball the previous christmas would it fill itself with chamber pot dobby expects so sir said dobby nodding earnestly it is a most amazing room sir how many people know about it said harry sitting up straighter in his chair page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling very few sir mostly people stumble across it when they need it sir but often they never find it again for they do not know that it is always there waiting to be called into service sir it sound brilliant said harry his heart racing it sound perfect dobby when can you show me where it is anytime harry potter sir said dobby looking delighted at harrys enthusiasm we could go now if you like for a moment harry wa tempted to go now he wa halfway out of his seat intending to hurry upstairs for his invisibility cloak when not for the first time a voice very much like hermiones whispered in his ear reckless it wa after all very late he wa exhausted and had snapes essay to finish not tonight dobby said harry reluctantly sinking back into his chair this is really important i do not want to blow it it will need proper planning listen can you just tell me exactly where this room of requirement is and how to get in there their robe billowed and swirled around them a they splashed across the flooded vegetable patch to double herbology where they could hardly hear what professor sprout wa saying over the hammering of raindrop hard a hailstone on the greenhouse roof the afternoon care of magical creature lesson wa to be relocated from the stormswept ground to a free classroom on the ground floor and to their intense relief angelina sought out her team at lunch to tell them that quidditch practice wa canceled good said harry quietly when she told him because we have found somewhere to have our first page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling defense meeting tonight eight of the clock seventh floor opposite that tapestry of barnabas the barmy being clubbed by those troll can you tell katie and alicia she looked slightly taken aback but promised to tell the others harry returned hungrily to his sausage and mash when he looked up to take a drink of pumpkin juice he found hermione watching him what he said thickly well it just that dobbys plan are not always that safe do not you remember when he lost you all the bone in your arm this room is not just some mad idea of dobbys dumbledore know about it too he mentioned it to me at the yule ball hermiones expression cleared dumbledore told you about it just in passing said harry shrugging oh well that is all right then said hermione briskly and she raised no more objection together with ron they had spent most of the day seeking out those people who had signed their name to the list in the hog head and telling them where to meet that evening somewhat to harrys disappointment it wa ginny who managed to find cho chang and her friend first however by the end of dinner he wa confident that the news had been passed to every one of the twentyfive people who had turned up in the hog head page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling at halfpast seven harry ron and hermione left the gryffindor common room harry clutching a certain piece of aged parchment in his hand fifth year were allowed to be out in the corridor until nine of the clock but all three of them kept looking around nervously a they made their way up to the seventh floor hold it said harry warningly unfolding the piece of parchment at the top of the last staircase tapping it with his wand and muttering i solemnly swear that i am up to no good a map of hogwarts appeared upon the blank surface of the parchment tiny black moving dot labeled with name showed where various people were filch is on the second floor said harry holding the map close to his eye and scanning it closely and mr norris is on the fourth and umbridge said hermione anxiously in her office said harry pointing okay let u go they hurried along the corridor to the place dobby had described to harry a stretch of blank wall opposite an enormous tapestry depicting barnabas the barmys foolish attempt to train troll for the ballet okay said harry quietly while a motheaten troll paused in his relentless clubbing of the wouldbe ballet teacher to watch dobby said to walk past this bit of wall three time concentrating hard on what we need they did so turning sharply at the window just beyond the blank stretch of wall then at the mansize vase on it other side ron had screwed up his eye in page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling concentration hermione wa whispering something under her breath harrys fist were clenched a he stared ahead of him we need somewhere to learn to fight he thought just give u a place to practice somewhere they can not find u harry said hermione sharply a they wheeled around after their third walk past a highly polished door had appeared in the wall ron wa staring at it looking slightly wary harry reached out seized the brass handle pulled open the door and led the way into a spacious room lit with flickering torch like those that illuminated the dungeon eight floor below the wall were lined with wooden bookcase and instead of chair there were large silk cushion on the floor a set of shelf at the far end of the room carried a range of instrument such a sneakoscopes secrecy sensor and a large cracked foeglass that harry wa sure had hung the previous year in the fake moody office these will be good when were practicing stunning said ron enthusiastically prodding one of the cushion with his foot and just look at these book said hermione excitedly running a finger along the spine of the large leatherbound tome a compendium of common curse and their counteraction the dark art outsmarted selfdefensive spellwork wow she looked around at harry her face glowing and he saw that the presence of hundred of book had finally convinced hermione that what they page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling were doing wa right harry this is wonderful there is everything we need here and without further ado she slid jinx for the jinxed from it shelf sank onto the nearest cushion and began to read there wa a gentle knock on the door harry looked around ginny neville lavender parvati and dean had arrived whoa said dean staring around impressed what is this place harry began to explain but before he had finished more people had arrived and he had to start all over again by the time eight of the clock arrived every cushion wa occupied harry moved across to the door and turned the key protruding from the lock it clicked in a satisfyingly loud way and everybody fell silent looking at him hermione carefully marked her page of jinx for the jinxed and set the book aside well said harry slightly nervously this is the place we have found for practice and you have er obviously found it okay it fantastic said cho and several people murmured their agreement it bizarre said fred frowning around at it we once hid from filch in here remember george but it wa just a broom cupboard then hey harry what is this stuff asked dean from the rear of the room indicating the sneakoscopes and the foeglass page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dark detector said harry stepping between the cushion to reach them basically they all show when dark wizard or enemy are around but you do not want to rely on them too much they can be fooled he gazed for a moment into the cracked foeglass shadowy figure were moving around inside it though none wa recognizable he turned his back on it well i have been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and er he noticed a raised hand what hermione i think we ought to elect a leader said hermione harrys leader said cho at once looking at hermione a though she were mad and harrys stomach did yet another back flip yes but i think we ought to vote on it properly said hermione unperturbed it make it formal and it give him authority so everyone who think harry ought to be our leader everybody put up their hand even zacharias smith though he did it very halfheartedly er right thanks said harry who could feel his face burning and what hermione i also think we ought to have a name she said brightly her hand still in the air it would promote a feeling of team spirit and unity do not you think can we be the antiumbridge league said angelina hopefully page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling or the ministry of magic are moron group suggested fred i wa thinking said hermione frowning at fred more of a name that did not tell everyone what we were up to so we can refer to it safely outside meeting the defense association said cho the da for short so nobody know what were talking about yeah the da good said ginny only let u make it stand for dumbledores army because that is the ministry worst fear is not it there wa a good deal of appreciative murmuring and laughter at this all in favor of the da said hermione bossily kneeling up on her cushion to count that is a majority motion passed she pinned the piece of paper with all of their name on it on the wall and wrote dumbledores army across the top in large letter right said harry when she had sat down again shall we get practicing then i wa thinking the first thing we should do is expelliarmus you know the disarming charm i know it pretty basic but i have found it really useful oh please said zacharias smith rolling his eye and folding his arm i do not think expelliarmus is exactly going to help u against youknowwho do you i have used it against him said harry quietly it saved my life last june page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling smith opened his mouth stupidly the rest of the room wa very quiet but if you think it beneath you you can leave harry said smith did not move nor did anybody else okay said harry his mouth slightly drier than usual with all those eye upon him i reckon we should all divide into pair and practice it felt very odd to be issuing instruction but not nearly a odd a seeing them followed everybody got to their foot at once and divided up predictably neville wa left partnerless you can practice with me harry told him right on the count of three then one two three the room wa suddenly full of shout of expelliarmusl wand flew in all direction missed spell hit book on shelf and sent them flying into the air harry wa too quick for neville whose wand went spinning out of his hand hit the ceiling in a shower of spark and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf from which harry retrieved it with a summoning charm glancing around he thought he had been right to suggest that they practice the basic first there wa a lot of shoddy spellwork going on many people were not succeeding in disarming their opponent at all but merely causing them to jump backward a few pace or wince a the feeble spell whooshed over them expelliarmusl said neville and harry caught unawares felt his wand fly out of his hand page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i did it said neville gleefully i have never done it before i did it good one said harry encouragingly deciding not to point out that in a real duel situation nevilles opponent wa unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side listen neville can you take it in turn to practice with ron and hermione for a couple of minute so i can walk around and see how the rest are doing harry moved off into the middle of the room something very odd wa happening to zacharias smith every time he opened his mouth to disarm anthony goldstein his own wand would fly out of his hand yet anthony did not seem to be making a sound harry did not have to look far for the solution of the mystery however fred and george were several foot from smith and taking it in turn to point their wand at his back sorry harry said george hastily when harry caught his eye could not resist harry walked around the other pair trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong ginny wa teamed with michael corner she wa doing very well whereas michael wa either very bad or unwilling to jinx her ernie macmillan wa flourishing his wand unnecessarily giving his partner time to get in under his guard the creevey brother were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the book leaping off the shelf around them luna lovegood wa similarly patchy occasionally sending justin finchfletchleys wand spinning out of his hand at other time merely causing his hair to stand on end okay stop harry shouted stop stop page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i need a whistle he thought and immediately spotted one lying on top of the nearest row of book he caught it up and blew hard everyone lowered their wand that wa not bad said harry but there is definite room for improvement zacharias smith glared at him let u try again he moved off around the room again stopping here and there to make suggestion slowly the general performance improved he avoided going near cho and her friend for a while but after walking twice around every other pair in the room felt he could not ignore them any longer oh no said cho rather wildly a he approached expelliarmiousl i mean exnellimellius i oh sorry marietta her curlyhaired friend sleeve had caught fire marietta extinguished it with her own wand and glared at harry a though it wa his fault you made me nervous i wa doing all right before then cho told harry ruefully that wa quite good harry lied but when she raised her eyebrow he said well no it wa lousy but i know you can do it properly i wa watching from over there she laughed her friend marietta looked at them rather sourly and turned away do not mind her cho muttered she doe not really want to be here but i made her come with me her parent have forbidden her to do anything that might page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling upset umbridge you see her mum work for the ministry what about your parent asked harry well they have forbidden me to get on the wrong side of umbridge too said cho drawing herself up proudly but if they think i am not going to fight youknow who after what happened to cedric she broke off looking rather confused and an awkward silence fell between them terry boot wand went whizzing past harrys ear and hit alicia spinnet hard on the nose well my father is very supportive of any anti ministry action said luna lovegood proudly from just behind harry evidently she had been eavesdropping on his conversation while justin finchfletchley attempted to disentangle himself from the robe that had flown up over his head he always saying he would believe anything of fudge i mean the number of goblin fudge ha had assassinated and of course he us the department of mystery to develop terrible poison which he feed secretly to anybody who disagrees with him and then there is his umgubular slashkilter do not ask harry muttered to cho a she opened her mouth looking puzzled she giggled hey harry hermione called from the other end of the room have you checked the time he looked down at his watch and received a shock it wa already ten past nine which meant they needed to get back to their common room immediately or risk being caught and punished by filch for being outofbounds he blew his whistle page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling everybody stopped shouting expelliarmusl and the last couple of wand clattered to the floor well that wa pretty good said harry but we have overrun wed better leave it here same time same place next week sooner said dean thomas eagerly and many people nodded in agreement angelina however said quickly the quidditch season about to start we need team practice too let u say next wednesday night then said harry and we can decide on additional meeting then come on wed better get going he pulled out the marauder map again and checked it carefully for sign of teacher on the seventh floor he let them all leave in three and four watching their tiny dot anxiously to see that they returned safely to their dormitory the hufflepuffs to the basement corridor that also led to the kitchen the ravenclaws to a tower on the west side of the castle and the gryffindors along the corridor to the seventh floor and the fat lady portrait that wa really really good harry said hermione when finally it wa just her harry and ron left yeah it wa said ron enthusiastically a they slipped out of the door and watched it melt back into stone behind them did you see me disarm hermione harry only once said hermione stung i got you load more than you got me page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i did not only get you once i got you at least three time well if you are counting the one where you tripped over your own foot and knocked the wand out of my hand they argued all the way back to the common room but harry wa not listening to them he had one eye on the marauder map but he wa also thinking of how cho had said he made her nervous page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the lion and the serpent harry felt a though he were carrying some kind of talisman inside his chest over the following two week a glowing secret that supported him through umbridges class and even made it possible for him to smile blandly a he looked into her horrible bulging eye he and the da were resisting her under her very nose doing the very thing that she and the ministry most feared and whenever he wa supposed to be reading wilbert slinkhards book during her lesson he dwelled instead on satisfying memory of their most recent meeting remembering how neville had successfully disarmed hermione how colin creevey had mastered the impediment jinx after three meeting hard effort how parvati patil had produced such a good reductor curse that she had reduced the table carrying all the sneakoscopes to dust he wa finding it almost impossible to fix a regular night of the week for da meeting a they had to accommodate three separate quidditch team practice which were often rearranged depending on page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the weather condition but harry wa not sorry about this he had a feeling that it wa probably better to keep the timing of their meeting unpredictable if anyone wa watching them it would be hard to make out a pattern hermione soon devised a very clever method of communicating the time and date of the next meeting to all the member in case they needed to change it at short notice because it would look so suspicious if people from different house were seen crossing the great hall to talk to each other too often she gave each of the member of the da a fake galleon ron became very excited when he saw the basket at first convinced that she wa actually giving out gold you see the numeral around the edge of the coin hermione said holding one up for examination at the end of their fourth meeting the coin gleamed fat and yellow in the light from the torch on real galleon that is just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin on these fake coin though the number will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting the coin will grow hot when the date change so if you are carrying them in a pocket you will be able to feel them we take one each and when harry set the date of the next meeting hell change the number on his coin and because i have put a protean charm on them they will all change to mimic his a blank silence greeted hermione s word she looked around at all the face upturned to her rather disconcerted well i thought it wa a good idea she said uncertainly i mean even if umbridge asked u to turn out our pocket there is nothing fishy about page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling carrying a galleon is there but well if you do not want to use them you can do a protean charm said terry boot yes said hermione but that is that is newt standard that is he said weakly oh said hermione trying to look modest oh well yes i suppose it is how come you are not in ravenclaw he demanded staring at hermione with something close to wonder with brain like yours well the sorting hat did seriously consider putting me in ravenclaw during my sorting said hermione brightly but it decided on gryffindor in the end so doe that mean were using the galleon there wa a murmur of assent and everybody moved forward to collect one from the basket harry looked sideways at hermione you know what these remind me of no what is that the death eater scar voldemort touch one of them and all their scar burn and they know they have got to join him well yes said hermione quietly that is where i got the idea but you will notice i decided to engrave the date on bit of metal rather than on our member skin page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah i prefer your way said harry grinning a he slipped his galleon into his pocket i suppose the only danger with these is that we might accidentally spend them fat chance said ron who wa examining his own fake galleon with a slightly mournful air i have not got any real galleon to confuse it with a the first quidditch match of the season gryffindor versus slytherin drew nearer their da meeting were put on hold because angelina insisted on almost daily practice the fact that the quidditch cup had not been held for so long added considerably to the interest and excitement surrounding the forthcoming game the ravenclaws and hufflepuffs were taking a lively interest in the outcome for they of course would be playing both team over the coming year and the head of house of the competing team though they attempted to disguise it under a decent pretense of sportsmanship were determined to see their side victory harry realized how much professor mcgonagall cared about beating slytherin when she abstained from giving them homework in the week leading up to the match i think you have got enough to be getting on with at the moment she said loftily nobody could quite believe their ear until she looked directly at harry and ron and said grimly i have become accustomed to seeing the quidditch cup in my study boy and i really do not want to have to hand it over to professor snape so use the extra time to practice will not you snape wa no le obviously partisan he had booked the quidditch pitch for slytherin practice so often that the gryffindors had difficulty getting on it to play he wa also turning a deaf ear to the many report of slytherin attempt to hex gryffindor page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling player in the corridor when alicia spinnet turned up in the hospital wing with her eyebrow growing so thick and fast that they obscured her vision and obstructed her mouth snape insisted that she must have attempted a hairthickening charm on herself and refused to listen to the fourteen eyewitness who insisted that they had seen the slytherin keeper mile bletchley hit her from behind with a jinx while she worked in the library harry felt optimistic about gryffindors chance they had after all never lost to malfoys team admittedly ron wa still not performing to wood standard but he wa working extremely hard to improve his greatest weakness wa a tendency to lose confidence when he made a blunder if he let in one goal he became flustered and wa therefore likely to miss more on the other hand harry had seen ron make some truly spectacular save when he wa on form during one memorable practice he had hung one handed from his broom and kicked the quaffle so hard away from the goal hoop that it soared the length of the pitch and through the center hoop at the other end the rest of the team felt this save compared favorably with one made recently by barry ryan the irish international keeper against poland top chaser ladislaw zamojski even fred had said that ron might yet make him and george proud and that they were seriously considering admitting that he wa related to them something he assured ron they had been trying to deny for four year the only thing really worrying harry wa how much ron wa allowing the tactic of the slytherin team to upset him before they even got onto the pitch harry of course had endured their snide comment for more than four year so whisper of hey potty i heard warringtons sworn to knock you off your broom on saturday far from chilling his blood made page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling him laugh warringtons aim so pathetic id be more worried if he wa aiming for the person next to me he retorted which made ron and hermione laugh and wiped the smirk off pansy parkinson face but ron had never endured a relentless campaign of insult jeer and intimidation when slytherins some of them seventh year and considerably larger than he wa muttered a they passed in the corridor got your bed booked in the hospital wing weasley he did not laugh but turned a delicate shade of green when draco malfoy imitated ron dropping the quaffle which he did whenever they were within sight of each other ron ear glowed red and his hand shook so badly that he wa likely to drop whatever he wa holding at the time too october extinguished itself in a rush of howling wind and driving rain and november arrived cold a frozen iron with hard frost every morning and icy draft that bit at exposed hand and face the sky and the ceiling of the great hall turned a pale pearly gray the mountain around hogwarts became snowcapped and the temperature in the castle dropped so far that many student wore their thick protective dragon skin glove in the corridor between lesson the morning of the match dawned bright and cold when harry awoke he looked around at ron bed and saw him sitting bolt upright his arm around his knee staring fixedly into space you all right said harry ron nodded but did not speak harry wa reminded forcibly of the time that ron had accidentally put a slug vomiting charm on himself he looked just a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling pale and sweaty a he had done then not to mention a reluctant to open his mouth you just need some breakfast harry said bracingly cmon the great hall wa filling up fast when they arrived the talk louder and the mood more exuberant than usual a they passed the slytherin table there wa an upsurge of noise harry looked around and saw that nearly everyone there wa wearing in addition to the usual greenandsilver scarf and hat silver badge in the shape of what seemed to be crown for some reason many of them waved at ron laughing uproariously harry tried to see what wa written on the badge a he walked by but he wa too concerned to get ron past their table quickly to linger long enough to read them they received a rousing welcome at the gryffindor table where everyone wa wearing red and gold but far from raising ron spirit the cheer seemed to sap the last of his morale he collapsed onto the nearest bench looking a though he were facing his final meal i must have been mental to do this he said in a croaky whisper mental do not be thick said harry firmly passing him a choice of cereal you are going to be fine it normal to be nervous i am rubbish croaked ron i am lousy i can not play to save my life what wa i thinking get a grip said harry sternly look at that save you made with your foot the other day even fred and george said it wa brilliant page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ron turned a tortured face to harry that wa an accident he whispered miserably i did not mean to do it i slipped off my broom when none of you were looking and i wa trying to get back on and i kicked the quaffle by accident well said harry recovering quickly from this unpleasant surprise a few more accident like that and the game in the bag is not it hermione and ginny sat down opposite them wearing redandgold scarf glove and rosette how are you feeling ginny asked ron who wa now staring into the dreg of milk at the bottom of his empty cereal bowl a though seriously considering attempting to drown himself in them he just nervous said harry well that is a good sign i never feel you perform a well in exam if you are not a bit nervous said hermione heartily hello said a vague and dreamy voice from behind them harry looked up luna lovegood had drifted over from the ravenclaw table many people were staring at her and a few openly laughing and pointing she had managed to procure a hat shaped like a lifesize lion head which wa perched precariously on her head i am supporting gryffindor said luna pointing unnecessarily at her hat look what it doe she reached up and tapped the hat with her wand it opened it mouth wide and gave an extremely realistic roar that made everyone in the vicinity jump page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it good is not it said luna happily i wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent slytherin you know but there wa not time anyway good luck ronald she drifted away they had not quite recovered from the shock of luna hat before angelina came hurrying toward them accompanied by katie and alicia whose eyebrow had mercifully been returned to normal by madam pomfrey when you are ready she said were going to go straight down to the pitch check out condition and change well be there in a bit harry assured her ron just got to have some breakfast it became clear after ten minute however that ron wa not capable of eating anything more and harry thought it best to get him down to the changing room a they rose from the table hermione got up too and taking harrys arm she drew him to one side do not let ron see what is on those slytherins badge she whispered urgently harry looked questioningly at her but she shook her head warningly ron had just ambled over to them looking lost and desperate good luck ron said hermione standing on tiptoe and kissing him on the cheek and you harry ron seemed to come to himself slightly a they walked back across the great hall he touched the spot on his face where hermione had kissed him looking puzzled a though he wa not quite sure page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what had just happened he seemed too distracted to notice much around him but harry cast a curious glance at the crownshaped badge a they passed the slytherin table and this time he made out the word etched onto them weasley is our king with an unpleasant feeling that this could mean nothing good he hurried ron across the entrance hall down the stone step and out into the icy air the frosty grass crunched under their foot a they hurried down the sloping lawn toward the stadium there wa no wind at all and the sky wa a uniform pearly white which meant that visibility would be good without the drawback of direct sunlight in the eye harry pointed out these encouraging factor to ron a they walked but he wa not sure that ron wa listening angelina had changed already and wa talking to the rest of the team when they entered harry and ron pulled on their robe ron attempted to do his up backtofront for several minute before alicia took pity on him and went to help and then sat down to listen to the prematch talk while the babble of voice outside grew steadily louder a the crowd came pouring out of the castle toward the pitch okay eve only just found out the final lineup for slytherin said angelina consulting a piece of parchment last year beater derrick and bole have left now but it look a though montagues replaced them with the usual gorilla rather than anyone who can fly particularly well they are two page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling bloke called crabbe and goyle i do not know much about them we do said harry and ron together well they do not look bright enough to tell one end of a broom from another said angelina pocketing her parchment but then i wa always surprised derrick and bole managed to find their way onto the pitch without signpost crabbe and goyle are in the same mold harry assured her they could hear hundred of footstep mounting the banked bench of the spectator stand now some people were singing though harry could not make out the word he wa starting to feel nervous but he knew his butterfly were a nothing to ron who wa clutching his stomach and staring straight ahead again his jaw set and his complexion pale gray it time said angelina in a hushed voice looking at her watch cmon everyone good luck the team rose shouldered their broom and marched in single file out of the changing room and into the dazzling sunlight a roar of sound greeted them in which harry could still hear singing though it wa muffled by the cheer and whistle the slytherin team were standing waiting for them they too were wearing those silver crownshaped badge the new captain montague wa built along the same line a dudley with massive forearm like hairy ham behind him lurked crabbe and goyle almost a large blinking stupidly in the sunlight swinging their new beater bat malfoy stood to one side the sunlight gleaming on his whiteblond head page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he caught harrys eye and smirked tapping the crownshaped badge on his chest captain shake hand ordered the umpire madam hooch a angelina and montague reached each other harry could tell that montague wa trying to crush angelinas finger though she did not wince mount your broom madam hooch placed her whistle in her mouth and blew the ball were released and the fourteen player shot upward out of the corner of his eye harry saw ron streak off toward the goal hoop he zoomed higher dodging a bludger and set off on a wide lap of the pitch gazing around for a glint of gold on the other side of the stadium draco malfoy wa doing exactly the same and it johnson johnson with the quaffle what a player that girl is i have been saying it for year but she still will not go out with me jordan yelled professor mcgonagall just a fun fact professor add a bit of interest and she is ducked warrington she is passed montague she is ouch been hit from behind by a bludger from crabbe montague catch the quaffle montague heading back up the pitch and nice bludger there from george weasley that is a bludger to the head for montague he drop the quaffle caught by katie bell katie bell of gryffindor reverse pass to alicia spinnet and spinnets away lee jordan commentary rang through the stadium and harry listened a hard a he could through the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wind whistling in his ear and the din of the crowd all yelling and booing and singing dodge warrington avoids a bludger close call alicia and the crowd are loving this just listen to them what is that they are singing and a lee paused to listen the song rose loud and clear from the sea of green and silver in the slytherin section of the stand weasley can not save a thing he can not block a single ring that is why slytherins all sing weasley is our king weasley wa born in a bin he always let u the quaffle in weasley will make sure we win weasley is our king and alicia pass back to angelina lee shouted and a harry swerved his inside boiling at what he had just heard he knew lee wa trying to drown out the sound of the singing come on now angelina look like she is got just the keeper to beat she shoot she aaaah bletchley the slytherin keeper had saved the goal he threw the quaffle to warrington who sped off with it zigzagging in between alicia and katie the singing from below grew louder and louder a he drew nearer and nearer ron weasley is our king weasley is our king he always let u the quaffle in weasley is our king page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry could not help himself abandoning his search for the snitch he turned his firebolt toward ron a lone figure at the far end of the pitch hovering before the three goal hoop while the massive warrington pelted toward him and it warrington with the quaffle warrington heading for goal he out of bludger range with just the keeper ahead a great swell of song rose from the slytherin stand below weasley can not save a thing he can not block a single ring so it the first test for new gryffindor keeper weasley brother of beater fred and george and a promising new talent on the team come on ron but the scream of delight came from the slytherin end ron had dived wildly his arm wide and the quaffle had soared between them straight through ron central hoop slytherin score came lee voice amid the cheering and booing from the crowd below so that is tennil to slytherin bad luck ron the slytherins sang even louder weasley wa born in a bin he always let u the quaffle in and gryffindor back in possession and it katie bell tanking up the pitch cried lee valiantly though the singing wa now so deafening that he could hardly make himself heard above it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling weasley will make sure we win weasley is our king harry what are you doing screamed angelina soaring past him to keep up with katie get going harry realized that he had been stationary in midair for more than a minute watching the progress of the match without sparing a thought for the whereabouts of the snitch horrified he went into a dive and started circling the pitch again staring around trying to ignore the chorus now thundering through the stadium weasley is our king weasley is our king there wa no sign of the snitch anywhere he looked malfoy wa still circling the stadium just like harry they passed midway around the pitch going in opposite direction and harry heard malfoy singing loudly weasley wa born in a bin and it warrington again bellowed lee who pass to pucey puceys off past spinnet come on now angelina you can take him turn out you can not but nice bludger from fred weasley i mean george weasley oh who care one of them anyway and warrington drop the quaffle and katie bell er drop it too so that is montague with the quaffle slytherin captain montague take the quaffle and he off up the pitch come on now gryffindor block him harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the slytherin goal hoop willing himself not to look at page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what wa going on at ron end a he sped past the slytherin keeper he heard bletchley singing along with the crowd below weasley can not save a thing and puceys dodged alicia again and he heading straight for goal stop it ron harry did not have to look to see what had happened there wa a terrible groan from the gryffindor end coupled with fresh scream and applause from the slytherins looking down harry saw the pugfaced pansy parkinson right at the front of the stand her back to the pitch a she conducted the slytherin supporter who were roaring that is why slytherins all sing weasley is our king but twentynil wa nothing there wa still time for gryffindor to catch up or catch the snitch a few goal and they would be in the lead a usual harry assured himself bobbing and weaving through the other player in pursuit of something shiny that turned out to be montagues watch strap but ron let in two more goal there wa an edge of panic in harrys desire to find the snitch now if he could just get it soon and finish the game quickly and katie bell of gryffindor dodge pucey duck montague nice swerve katie and she throw to johnson angelina johnson take the quaffle she is past warrington she is heading for goal come on now angelina gryffindor score it fortyten forty ten to slytherin and pucey ha the quaffle page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry could hear luna ludicrous lion hat roaring amidst the gryffindor cheer and felt heartened only thirty point in it that wa nothing they could pull back easily harry ducked a bludger that crabbe had sent rocketing in his direction and resumed his frantic scouring of the pitch for the snitch keeping one eye on malfoy in case he showed sign of having spotted it but malfoy like him wa continuing to soar around the stadium searching fruitlessly pucey throw to warrington warrington to montague montague back to pucey johnson intervenes johnson take the quaffle johnson to bell this look good i mean bad bell hit by a bludger from goyle of slytherin and it pucey in possession again weasley wa born in a bin he always let u the quaffle in weasley will make sure we win but harry had seen it at last the tiny fluttering golden snitch wa hovering foot from the ground at the slytherin end of the pitch he dived in a matter of second malfoy wa streaking out of the sky on harrys left a greenandsilver blur lying flat on his broom the snitch skirted the foot of one of the goal hoop and scooted off toward the other side of the stand it change of direction suited malfoy who wa nearer harry pulled his firebolt around he and malfoy were now neck and neck page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling foot from the ground harry lifted his right hand from his broom stretching toward the snitch to his right malfoys arm extended too reaching groping it wa over in two breathless desperate windswept second harrys finger closed around the tiny struggling ball malfoys fingernail scrabbled the back of harrys hand hopelessly harry pulled his broom upward holding the struggling ball in his hand and the gryffindor spectator screamed their approval they were saved it did not matter that ron had let in those goal nobody would remember a long a gryffindor had won wham a bludger hit harry squarely in the small of the back and he flew forward off his broom luckily he wa only five or six foot above the ground having dived so low to catch the snitch but he wa winded all the same a he landed flat on his back on the frozen pitch he heard madam hooch shrill whistle an uproar in the stand compounded of catcall angry yell and jeering a thud then angelinas frantic voice are you all right course i am said harry grimly taking her hand and allowing her to pull him to his foot madam hooch wa zooming toward one of the slytherin player above him though he could not see who it wa at this angle it wa that thug crabbe said angelina angrily he whacked the bludger at you the moment he saw you would got the snitch but we won harry we won page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry heard a snort from behind him and turned around still holding the snitch tightly in his hand draco malfoy had landed close by whitefaced with fury he wa still managing to sneer saved weasleys neck have not you he said to harry i have never seen a worse keeper but then he wa born in a bin did you like my lyric potter harry did not answer he turned away to meet the rest of the team who were now landing one by one yelling and punching the air in triumph all except ron who had dismounted from his broom over by the goalpost and wa making his way slowly back to the changing room alone we wanted to write another couple of verse malfoy called a katie and alicia hugged harry but we could not find rhyme for fat and ugly we wanted to sing about his mother see talk about sour grape said angelina casting malfoy a disgusted look we could not fit in useless loser either for his father you know fred and george had realized what malfoy wa talking about halfway through shaking harrys hand they stiffened looking around at malfoy leave it said angelina at once taking fred by the arm leave it fred let him yell he just sore he lost the jumpedup little but you like the weasleys do not you potter said malfoy sneering spend holiday there and everything do not you can not see how you stand the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling stink but i suppose when you have been dragged up by muggles even the weasleys hovel smell okay harry grabbed hold of george meanwhile it wa taking the combined effort of angelina alicia and katie to stop fred leaping on malfoy who wa laughing openly harry looked around for madam hooch but she wa still berating crabbe for his illegal bludger attack or perhaps said malfoy leering a he backed away you can remember what your mother house stank like potter and weasleys pigsty reminds you of it harry wa not aware of releasing george all he knew wa that a second later both of them were sprinting at malfoy he had completely forgotten the fact that all the teacher were watching all he wanted to do wa because malfoy a much pain a possible with no time to draw out his wand he merely drew back the fist clutching the snitch and sank it a hard a he could into malfoys stomach harry harry george vo he could hear girl voice screaming malfoy yelling george swearing a whistle blowing and the bellowing of the crowd around him but he did not care not until somebody in the vicinity yelled impedimenta and only when he wa knocked over backward by the force of the spell did he abandon the attempt to punch every inch of malfoy he could reach what do you think you are doing screamed madam hooch a harry leapt to his foot again it wa she who had hit him with the impediment jinx she wa holding her whistle in one hand and a wand in the other her broom lay abandoned several foot away malfoy wa curled up on the ground whimpering and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling moaning his nose bloody george wa sporting a swollen lip fred wa still being forcibly restrained by the three chaser and crabbe wa cackling in the background i have never seen behavior like it back up to the castle both of you and straight to your head of house office go now harry and george marched off the pitch both panting neither saying a word to each other the howling and jeering of the crowd grew fainter and fainter until they reached the entrance hall where they could hear nothing except the sound of their own footstep harry became aware that something wa still struggling in his right hand the knuckle of which he had bruised against malfoys jaw looking down he saw the snitch silver wing protruding from between his finger struggling for release they had barely reached the door of professor mcgonagalls office when she came marching along the corridor behind them she wa wearing a gryffindor scarf but tore it from her throat with shaking hand a she strode toward them looking livid in she said furiously pointing to the door harry and george entered she strode around behind her desk and faced them quivering with rage a she threw the gryffindor scarf aside onto the floor well she said i have never seen such a disgraceful exhibition two onto one explain yourselves malfoy provoked u said harry stiffly provoked you shouted professor mcgonagall slamming a fist onto her desk so that her tartan biscuit tin slid sideways off it and burst open littering the floor with ginger newt he would just lost had not he page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling of course he wanted to provoke you but what on earth he can have said that justified what you two he insulted my parent snarled george and harrys mother but instead of leaving it to madam hooch to sort out you two decided to give an exhibition of muggle dueling did you bellowed professor mcgonagall have you any idea what you have hem hem george and harry both spun around dolores umbridge wa standing in the doorway wrapped in a green tweed cloak that greatly enhanced her resemblance to a giant toad and smiling in the horribly sickly ominous way that harry had come to associate with imminent misery may i help professor mcgonagall asked professor umbridge in her most poisonously sweet voice blood rushed into professor mcgonagalls face help she repeated in a constricted voice what do you mean help professor umbridge moved forward into the office still smiling her sickly smile why i thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority harry would not have been surprised to see spark fly from professor mcgonagalls nostril you thought wrong she said turning her back on umbridge now you two had better listen closely i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling do not care what provocation malfoy offered you i do not care if he insulted every family member you posse your behavior wa disgusting and i am giving each of you a week worth of detention do not look at me like that potter you deserve it and if either of you ever hem hem professor mcgonagall closed her eye a though praying for patience a she turned her face toward professor umbridge again yes i think they deserve rather more than detention said umbridge smiling still more broadly professor mcgonagalls eye flew open but unfortunately she said with an attempt at a reciprocal smile that made her look a though she had lockjaw it is what i think that count a they are in my house dolores well actually minerva simpered umbridge i think you will find that what i think doe count now where is it cornelius just sent it i mean she gave a little false laugh a she rummaged in her handbag the minister just sent it ah yes she had pulled out a piece of parchment that she now unfurled clearing her throat fussily before starting to read what it said hem hem educational decree number twenty five not another one exclaimed professor mcgonagall violently page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well yes said umbridge still smiling a a matter of fact minerva it wa you who made me see that we needed a further amendment you remember how you overrode me when i wa unwilling to allow the gryffindor quidditch team to reform how you took the case to dumbledore who insisted that the team be allowed to play well now i could not have that i contacted the minister at once and he quite agreed with me that the high inquisitor ha to have the power to strip pupil of privilege or she that is to say i would have le authority than common teacher and you see now do not you minerva how right i wa in attempting to stop the gryffindor team reforming dreadful temper anyway i wa reading out our amendment hem hem the high inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishment sanction and removal of privilege pertaining to the student of hogwarts and the power to alter such punishment sanction and removal of privilege a may have been ordered by other staff member signed cornelius fudge minister of magic order of merlin first class etc etc she rolled up the parchment and put it back into her handbag still smiling so i really think i will have to ban these two from playing quidditch ever again she said looking from harry to george and back again harry felt the snitch fluttering madly in his hand ban u he said and his voice sounded strangely distant from playing ever again yes mr potter i think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick said umbridge her smile widening still further a she watched him struggle to comprehend what she page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling had said you and mr weasley here and i think to be safe this young man twin ought to be stopped too if his teammate had not restrained him i feel sure he would have attacked young mr malfoy a well i will want their broomstick confiscated of course i shall keep them safely in my office to make sure there is no infringement of my ban but i am not unreasonable professor mcgonagall she continued turning back to professor mcgonagall who wa now standing a still a though carved from ice staring at her the rest of the team can continue playing i saw no sign of violence from any of them well good afternoon to you and with a look of the utmost satisfaction umbridge left the room leaving a horrified silence in her wake banned said angelina in a hollow voice late that evening in the common room banned no seeker and no beater what on earth are we going to do it did not feel a though they had won the match at all everywhere harry looked there were disconsolate and angry face the team themselves were slumped around the fire all apart from ron who had not been seen since the end of the match it just so unfair said alicia numbly i mean what about crabbe and that bludger he hit after the whistle had been blown ha she banned him no said ginny miserably she and hermione were sitting on either side of harry he just got line i heard montague laughing about it at dinner and banning fred when he did not even do anything said alicia furiously pummeling her knee with her fist page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it not my fault i did not said fred with a very ugly look on his face i would have pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three had not been holding me back harry stared miserably at the dark window snow wa falling the snitch he had caught earlier wa now zooming around and around the common room people were watching it progress a though hypnotized and crookshanks wa leaping from chair to chair trying to catch it i am going to bed said angelina getting slowly to her foot maybe this will all turn out to have been a bad dream maybe ill wake up tomorrow and find we have not played yet she wa soon followed by alicia and katie fred and george sloped off to bed some time later glowering at everyone they passed and ginny went not long after that only harry and hermione were left beside the fire have you seen ron hermione asked in a low voice harry shook his head i think he avoiding u said hermione where do you think he but at that precise moment there wa a creaking sound behind them a the fat lady swung forward and ron came clambering through the portrait hole he wa very pale indeed and there wa snow in his hair when he saw harry and hermione he stopped dead in his track page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling where have you been said hermione anxiously springing up walking ron mumbled he wa still wearing his quidditch thing you look frozen said hermione come and sit down ron walked to the fireside and sank into the chair farthest from harrys not looking at him the stolen snitch zoomed over their head i am sorry ron mumbled looking at his foot what for said harry for thinking i can play quidditch said ron i am going to resign first thing tomorrow if you resign said harry testily there will only be three player left on the team and when ron looked puzzled he said i have been given a lifetime ban so have fred and george what ron yelped hermione told him the full story harry could not bear to tell it again when she had finished ron looked more anguished than ever this is all my fault you did not make me punch malfoy said harry angrily if i wa not so lousy at quidditch it got nothing to do with that page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa that song that wound me up it would have wound anyone up hermione got up and walked to the window away from the argument watching the snow swirling down against the pane look drop it will you harry burst out it bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything ron said nothing but sat gazing miserably at the damp hem of his robe after a while he said in a dull voice this is the worst i have ever felt in my life join the club said harry bitterly well said hermione her voice trembling slightly i can think of one thing that might cheer you both up oh yeah said harry skeptically yeah said hermione turning away from the pitch black snowflecked window a broad smile spreading across her face hagrids back page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hagrids tale harry sprinted up to the boy dormitory to fetch the invisibility cloak and the marauder map from his trunk he wa so quick that he and ron were ready to leave at least five minute before hermione hurried back down from the girl dormitory wearing scarf glove and one of her own knobbly elf hat well it cold out there she said defensively a ron clicked his tongue impatiently they crept through the portrait hole and covered themselves hastily in the cloak ron had grown so much he now needed to crouch to prevent his foot showing then moving slowly and cautiously they proceeded down the many staircase pausing at interval to check the map for sign of filch or mr norris they were lucky they saw nobody but nearly headless nick who wa gliding along absentmindedly humming something that sounded horribly like weasley is our king they crept across the entrance hall and then out into the silent snowy ground with a great leap of his heart harry saw little golden square of light ahead and smoke coiling up from page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hagrids chimney he set off at a quick march the other two jostling and bumping along behind him and they crunched excitedly through the thickening snow until at last they reached the wooden front door when harry raised his fist and knocked three time a dog started barking frantically inside hagrid it u harry called through the keyhole shoulda known said a gruff voice they beamed at one another under the cloak they could tell that hagrids voice wa pleased bin home three second out the way fang out the way yeh dozy dog the bolt wa drawn back the door creaked open and hagrids head appeared in the gap hermione screamed merlin beard keep it down said hagrid hastily staring wildly over their head under that cloak are yeh well get in get in i am sorry hermione gasped a the three of them squeezed past hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them i just oh hagrid it nuthin it nuthin said hagrid hastily shutting the door behind them and hurrying to close all the curtain but hermione continued to gaze up at him in horror hagrids hair wa matted with congealed blood and his left eye had been reduced to a puffy slit amid a mass of purpleandblack bruise there were many cut on his face and hand some of them still page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling bleeding and he wa moving gingerly which made harry suspect broken rib it wa obvious that he had only just got home a thick black traveling cloak lay over the back of a chair and a haversack large enough to carry several small child leaned against the wall inside the door hagrid himself twice the size of a normal man and three time a broad wa now limping over to the fire and placing a copper kettle over it what happened to you harry demanded while fang danced around them all trying to lick their face told yeh nuthin said hagrid firmly want a cuppa come off it said ron you are in a right state i am tellinyeh i am fine said hagrid straightening up and turning to beam at them all but wincing blimey it good ter see you three again had good summer did yeh hagrid you have been attacked said ron fer the la time it nuthin said hagrid firmly would you say it wa nothing if one of u turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face ron demanded you ought to go and see madam pomfrey hagrid said hermione anxiously some of those cut look nasty i am dealin with it all righ said hagrid repressively page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he walked across to the enormous wooden table that stood in the middle of his cabin and twitched aside a tea towel that had been lying on it underneath wa a raw bloody greentinged steak slightly larger than the average car tire you are not going to eat that are you hagrid said ron leaning in for a closer look it look poisonous it s posed ter look like that it dragon meat hagrid said an i didn get it ter eat he picked up the steak and slapped it over the left side of his face greenish blood trickled down into his beard a he gave a soft moan of satisfaction thas better it help with the stingin yeh know so are you going to tell u what is happened to you harry asked can harry top secret moren me job worth ter tell yeh that did the giant beat you up hagrid asked hermione quietly hagrids finger slipped on the dragon steak and it slid squelchily onto his chest giant said hagrid catching the steak before it reached his belt and slapping it back over his face who said anythin abou giant who yeh bin talkin to who is told yeh what i have who is said i have bin eh we guessed said hermione apologetically page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh yeh did did yeh said hagrid fixing her sternly with the eye that wa not hidden by the steak it wa kind of obvious said ron harry nodded hagrid glared at them then snorted threw the steak onto the table again and strode back to the kettle which wa now whistling never known kid like you three fer knowin moren yeh oughta he muttered splashing boiling water into three of his bucketshaped mug an i am not complimentin yeh neither nosy somed call it interferin but his beard twitched so you have been to look for giant said harry grinning a he sat down at the table hagrid set tea in front of each of them sat down picked up his steak again and slapped it back over his face yeah all righ he grunted i have and you found them said hermione in a hushed voice well they are not that difficult ter find ter be honest said hagrid pretty big see where are they said ron mountain said hagrid unhelpfully so why do not muggles page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they do said hagrid darkly ony their death are always put down ter mountaineerin accident aren they he adjusted the steak a little so that it covered the worst of the bruising come on hagrid tell u what you have been up to said ron tell u about being attacked by the giant and harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors hagrid choked in his mug and dropped his steak at the same time a large quantity of spit tea and dragon blood wa sprayed over the table a hagrid coughed and spluttered and the steak slid with a soft splat onto the floor whadda yeh mean attacked by dementors growled hagrid did not you know hermione asked him wideeyed i don know anything that is been happenin since i left i wa on a secret mission wasn i didn wan owl followin me all over the place ruddy dementors yehre not serious yeah i am they turned up in little whinging and attacked my cousin and me and then the ministry of magic expelled me what and i had to go to a hearing and everything but tell u about the giant first you were expelled page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tell u about your summer and ill tell you about mine hagrid glared at him through his one open eye harry looked right back an expression of innocent determination on his face oh all righ hagrid said in a resigned voice he bent down and tugged the dragon steak out of fang mouth oh hagrid do not it not hygien hermione began but hagrid had already slapped the meat back over his swollen eye he took another fortifying gulp of tea and then said well we set off righ after term ended madame maxime went with you then hermione interjected yeah thas right said hagrid and a softened expression appeared on the few inch of face that were not obscured by beard or green steak yeah it wa jus the pair of u an ill tell yeh this she is not afraid of roughin it olympe yeh know she is a fine welldressed woman an knowin where we wa goin i wondered ow she would feel abou clamberin over boulder an sleepin in cave an tha bu she never complained once you knew where you were going harry asked you knew where the giant were well dumbledore knew an he told u said hagrid are they hidden asked ron is it a secret where they are page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling not really said hagrid shaking his shaggy head it jus that mo wizard aren bothered where they are s long a it a good long way away but where they are very difficult ter get ter fer human anyway so we needed dumbledores instruction took u abou a month ter get there a month said ron a though he had never heard of a journey lasting such a ridiculously long time but why could not you just grab a portkey or something there wa an odd expression in hagrids unobscured eye a he squinted at ron it wa almost pitying were bein watched ron he said gruffly what dyou mean yeh don understand said hagrid the ministry keepin an eye on dumbledore an anyone they reckons in league with him an we know about that said harry quickly keen to hear the rest of hagrids story we know about the ministry watching dumbledore so you could not use magic to get there asked ron looking thunderstruck you had to act like muggles all the way well not exactly all the way said hagrid cagily we jus had ter be careful because olympe an me we stick out a bit ron made a stifled noise somewhere between a snort and a sniff and hastily took a gulp of tea page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling so were not hard ter follow we wa pretendin we wa goin on holiday together so we got inter france an we made like we wa headin fer where olympes school is because we knew we wa bein tailed by someone from the ministry we had to go slow because i am not really s posed ter use magic an we knew the ministryd be lookin fer a reason ter run u in but we managed ter give the berk tailin u the slip round abou deejohn ooooh dijon said hermione excitedly i have been there on holiday did you see she fell silent at the look on ron face we chanced a bit o magic after that and it wasn a bad journey ran inter a couple o mad troll on the polish border an i had a sligh disagreement with a vampire in a pub in minsk but apart from tha couldnta bin smoother an then we reached the place an we started trekkin up through the mountain lookin fer sign of them we had ter lay off the magic once we got near them partly because they don like wizard an we didn want ter put their back up too soon and partly because dumbledore had warned u youknowwho wa bound ter be after the giant an all said it wa odds on he would sent a messenger off ter them already told u ter be very careful of drawin attention ter ourselves a we got nearer in case there wa death eater around hagrid paused for a long draft of tea go on said harry urgently page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling found them said hagrid baldly went over a ridge one nigh an there they wa spread ou underneath u little fire burnin below an huge shadow it wa like watchin bit o the mountain movin how big are they asked ron in a hushed voice tout twenty foot said hagrid casually some o the bigger one mighta bin twentyfive and how many were there asked harry i reckon abou seventy or eighty said hagrid is that all said hermione yep said hagrid sadly eighty left an there wa load once musta bin a hundred diffrent tribe from all over the world but they have bin dyin out fer age wizard killed a few o course but mostly they killed each other an now they are dyin out faster than ever they are not made ter live bunched up together like tha dumbledore say it our fault it wa the wizard who forced them to go an made them live a good long way from u an they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection so said harry you saw them and then what well we waited till morning didn want ter go sneakin up on them in the dark fer our own safety said hagrid bout three in the mornin they fell asleep jus where they wa sittin we didn dare sleep fer one thing we wanted ter make sure none of them woke up an came up where we were an fer another the snorin wa unbelievable caused an avalanche near mornin anyway once it wa light we wen down ter see them page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling just like that said ron looking awestruck you just walked right into a giant camp well dumbledored told u how ter do it said hagrid give the gurg gift show some respect yeh know give the what gift asked harry oh the gurg mean the chief how could you tell which one wa the gurg asked ron hagrid grunted in amusement no problem he said he wa the biggest the ugliest an the laziest sittin there waitin ter be brought food by the others dead goat an such like name o karkus id put him at twentytwo twenty three foot an the weight of a couple o bull elephant skin like rhino hide an all and you just walked up to him said hermione breathlessly well down ter him where he wa lyin in the valley they wa in this dip between four pretty high mountain see beside a mountain lake an karkus wa lyin by the lake roarin at the others ter feed him an his wife olympe an i went down the mountainside but did not they try and kill you when they saw you asked ron incredulously it wa defnitely on some of their mind said hagrid shrugging but we did what dumbledore told u ter do which wa ter hold our gift up high an page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling keep our eye on the gurg an ignore the others so thas what we did an the rest of them went quiet an watched u pas an we got right up ter karkuss foot an we bowed an put our present down in front o him what do you give a giant asked ron eagerly food nah he can get food all righ fer himself said hagrid we took him magic giant like magic jus do not like u usin it against them anyway that fir day we gave him a branch o gubraithian fire hermione said wow softly but harry and ron both frowned in puzzlement a branch of everlasting fire said hermione irritably you ought to know that by now professor flitwicks mentioned it at least twice in class well anyway said hagrid quickly intervening before ron could answer back dumbledored bewitched this branch to burn evermore which isn somethin any wizard could do an so i lie it down in the snow by karkuss foot and say a gift to the gurg of the giant from albus dumbledore who sends his respectful greeting and what did karkus say asked harry eagerly nothin said hagrid didn speak english you are kidding didn matter said hagrid imperturbably dumbledore had warned u tha migh happen page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling karkus knew enough to yell fer a couple o giant who knew our lingo an they translated fer u and did he like the present asked ron oh yeah it went down a storm once they understood what it wa said hagrid turning his dragon steak over to press the cooler side to his swollen eye very pleased so then i said altar dumbledore asks the gurg to speak with his messenger when he return tomorrow with another gift why could not you speak to them that day asked hermione dumbledore wanted u ter take it very slow said hagrid let them see we kept our promise well come back tomorrow with another present an then we do come back with another present give a good impression see an give them time ter test out the fir present an find out it a good one an get them eager fer more in any case giant like karkus overload them with information an they will kill yeh jus to simplify thing so we bowed outta the way an went off an found ourselves a nice little cave ter spend that night in an the followin mornin we went back an this time we found karkus sittin up waitin fer u lookin all eager and you talked to him oh yeah fir we presented him with a nice battle helmet goblinmade an indestructible yeh know an then we sat down an we talked what did he say not much said hagrid listened mostly but there were good sign he would heard o dumbledore heard page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he would argued against the killin of the last giant in britain karkus seemed ter be quite intrested in what dumbledore had ter say an a few o the others specially the one who had some english they gathered round an listened too we were hopeful when we left that day promised ter come back next day with another present but that night it all wen wrong what dyou mean said ron quickly well like i say they are not meant ter live together giant said hagrid sadly not in big group like that they can help themselves they half kill each other every few week the men fight each other an the woman fight each other the remnant of the old tribe fight each other an that is even without squabble over food an the best fire an sleepin spot yehd think seein a how their whole race is abou finished they would lay off each other but hagrid sighed deeply that night a fight broke out we saw it from the mouth of our cave lookin down on the valley went on fer hour yeh wouldn believe the noise an when the sun came up the snow wa scarlet an his head wa lyin at the bottom o the lake whose head gasped hermione karkuss said hagrid heavily there wa a new gurg golgomath he sighed deeply well we hadn bargained on a new gurg two day after wed made friendly contact with the fir one an we had a funny feelin golgomath wouldn be so keen ter listen to u but we had ter try page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you went to speak to him asked ron incredulously after you would watched him rip off another giant head course we did said hagrid we hadn gone all that way ter give up after two day we wen down with the next present wed meant ter give ter karkus i knew it wa no go before id opened me mouth he wa sitting there wearin karkus s helmet leerin at u a we got nearer he massive one o the biggest one there black hair an matchin teeth an a necklace o bone humanlookin bone some of them well i gave it a go held out a great roll o dragon skin an said a gift fer the gurg of the giant nex thing i knew i wa hangin upside down in the air by me foot two of his mate had grabbed me hermione clapped her hand to her mouth how did you get out of that asked harry wouldnta done if olympe hadn bin there said hagrid she pulled out her wand an did some o the fastes spellwork i have ever seen ruddy marvelous hit the two holdin me right in the eye with conjunctivitus curse an they dropped me straightaway bu we were in trouble then because wed used magic against them an that is what giant hate abou wizard we had ter leg it an we knew there wa no way we wa going ter be able ter march inter camp again blimey hagrid said ron quietly so how come it taken you so long to get home if you were only there for three day asked hermione page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling we didn leave after three day said hagrid looking outraged dumbledore wa relyin on u but you have just said there wa no way you could go back not by daylight we couldn no we just had ter rethink a bit spent a couple o day lyin low up in the cave an watchin an wha we saw wasn good did he rip off more head asked hermione sounding squeamish no said hagrid i wish he had what dyou mean i mean we soon found out he didn object ter all wizard just u death eater said harry quickly yep said hagrid darkly couple of them were visitin him evry day bringin gift ter the gurg an he wasn dangling them upside down how dyou know they were death eater said ron because i recognized one of them hagrid growled macnair remember him bloke they sent ter kill buckbeak maniac he is like killin a much a golgomath no wonder they were gettin on so well so macnairs persuaded the giant to join youknow who said hermione desperately hold yer hippogriffs i haven finished me story yet said hagrid indignantly who considering he had not wanted to tell them anything in the first place now page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling seemed to be rather enjoying himself me an olympe talked it over an we agreed jus because the gurg looked like favorin youknowwho didn mean all of them would we had ter try an persuade some o the others the one who hadn wanted golgomath a gurg how could you tell which one they were asked ron well they were the one bein beaten to a pulp weren they said hagrid patiently the one with any sense were keepin outta golgomath s way hidin out in cave roun the gully jus like we were so we decided wed go pokin round the cave by night an see if we couldn persuade a few o them you went poking around dark cave looking for giant said ron with awed respect in his voice well it wasn the giant who worried u most said hagrid we were more concerned abou the death eater dumbledore had told u before we wen not ter tangle with them if we could avoid it an the trouble wa they knew we wa around spect golgomath told him abou u at night when the giant were sleepin an we wanted ter be creepin inter the cave macnair an the other one were sneakin round the mountain lookin fer u i wa hard put to stop olympe jumpin out at them said hagrid the corner of his mouth lifting his wild beard she wa rarin ter attack them she is somethin when she is roused olympe fiery yeh know spect it the french in her hagrid gazed mistyeyed into the fire harry allowed him thirty second reminiscence before clearing his throat loudly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling so what happened did you ever get near any of the other giant what oh oh yeah we did yeah on the third night after karkus wa killed we crept outta the cave wed bin hidin in and headed back down inter the gully keepin our eye skinned fer the death eater got inside a few o the cave no go then in abou the sixth one we found three giant hidin cave must have been cramped said ron wasn room ter swing a kneazle said hagrid did not they attack you when they saw you asked hermione probably would have done if they would bin in any condition said hagrid but they wa badly hurt all three o them golgomaths lot had beaten them unconscious they would woken up an crawled inter the nearest shelter they could find anyway one o them had a bit of english an e translated fer the others an what we had ter say didn seem ter go down too badly so we kep goin back visitin the wounded i reckon we had abou six or seven o them convinced at one poin six or seven said ron eagerly well that is not bad are they going to come over here and start fighting youknowwho with u but hermione said what do you mean at one point hagrid hagrid looked at her sadly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling golgomaths lot raided the cave the one tha survived didn wan no more ter to do with u after that so so there are not any giant coming said ron looking disappointed nope said hagrid heaving a deep sigh a he turned over his steak again and applied the cooler side to his face but we did wha we meant ter do we gave them dumbledores message an some o them heard it an i spect some o themll remember it jus maybe them that don want ter stay around golgomathll move outta the mountain an there is got to be a chance they will remember dumbledores friendly to them could be they will come snow wa filling up the window now harry became aware that the knee of his robe were soaked through fang wa drooling with his head in harrys lap hagrid said hermione quietly after a while mmm did you wa there any sign of did you hear anything about your your mother while you were there hagrids unobscured eye rested upon her and hermione looked rather scared i am sorry i forget it dead hagrid grunted died year ago they told me page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh i am i am really sorry said hermione in a very small voice hagrid shrugged his massive shoulder no need he said shortly can remember her much wasn a great mother they were silent again hermione glanced nervously at harry and ron plainly wanting them to speak but you still have not explained how you got in this state hagrid ron said gesturing toward hagrids bloodstained face or why you are back so late said harry sirius say madame maxime got back age ago who attacked you said ron i haven bin attacked said hagrid emphatically i but the rest of his word were drowned in a sudden outbreak of rapping on the door hermione gasped her mug slipped through her finger and smashed on the floor fang yelped all four of them stared at the window beside the doorway the shadow of somebody small and squat rippled across the thin curtain it her ron whispered get under here harry said quickly seizing the invisibility cloak he whirled it over himself and hermione while ron tore around the table and dived beneath the cloak a well huddled together they backed away into a corner fang wa barking madly at the door hagrid looked thoroughly confused hagrid hide our mug page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hagrid seized harrys and ron mug and shoved them under the cushion in fang basket fang wa now leaping up at the door hagrid pushed him out of the way with his foot and pulled it open professor umbridge wa standing in the doorway wearing her green tweed cloak and a matching hat with earflap lip pursed she leaned back so a to see hagrids face she barely reached his navel so she said slowly and loudly a though speaking to somebody deaf you are hagrid are you without waiting for an answer she strolled into the room her bulging eye rolling in every direction get away she snapped waving her handbag at fang who had bounded up to her and wa attempting to lick her face er i don want ter be rude said hagrid staring at her but who the ruddy hell are you my name is dolores umbridge her eye were sweeping the cabin twice they stared directly into the corner where harry stood sandwiched between ron and hermione dolores umbridge hagrid said sounding thoroughly confused i thought you were one o them ministry don you work with fudge i wa senior undersecretary to the minister yes said umbridge now pacing around the cabin taking in every tiny detail within from the haversack against the wall to the abandoned traveling cloak i am now the defense against the dark art teacher page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling thas brave of yeh said hagrid there is not manyd take tha job anymore and hogwarts high inquisitor said umbridge giving no sign that she had heard him whas that said hagrid frowning precisely what i wa going to ask said umbridge pointing at the broken shard of china on the floor that had been hermiones mug oh said hagrid with a most unhelpful glance toward the corner where harry ron and hermione stood hidden oh tha wa wa fang he broke a mug so i had ter use this one instead hagrid pointed to the mug from which he had been drinking one hand still clamped over the dragon steak pressed to his eye umbridge stood facing him now taking in every detail of his appearance instead of the cabin i heard voice she said quietly i wa talkin ter fang said hagrid stoutly and wa he talking back to you well in a manner o speakin said hagrid looking uncomfortable i sometimes say fang near enough human there are three set of footprint in the snow leading from the castle door to your cabin said umbridge sleekly hermione gasped harry clapped a hand over her mouth luckily fang wa sniffing loudly around the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hem of professor umbridges robe and she did not appear to have heard well i ony jus got back said hagrid waving an enormous hand at the haversack maybe someone came ter call earlier an i missed them there are no footstep leading away from your cabin door well i i don know why that would be said hagrid tugging nervously at his beard and again glancing toward the corner where harry ron and hermione stood a though asking for help erm umbridge wheeled around and strode the length of the cabin looking around carefully she bent and peered under the bed she opened hagrid s cupboard she passed within two inch of where harry ron and hermione stood pressed against the wall harry actually pulled in his stomach a she walked by after looking carefully inside the enormous cauldron hagrid used for cooking she wheeled around again and said what ha happened to you how did you sustain those injury hagrid hastily removed the dragon steak from his face which in harrys opinion wa a mistake because the blackandpurple bruising all around his eye wa now clearly visible not to mention the large amount of fresh and congealed blood on his face oh i had a bit of an accident he said lamely what sort of accident ii tripped you tripped she repeated coolly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah thas right over over a friend broomstick i don fly meself well look at the size o me i don reckon there is a broomstick that would hold me friend o mine

hagrids babbling where ve i been yes she said term started more than two month ago another teacher ha had to cover your class none of your colleague ha been able to give me any information a to your whereabouts you left no address where have you been there wa a pause in which hagrid stared at her with his newly uncovered eye harry could almost hear his brain working furiously i i have been away for me health he said for your health said umbridge her eye traveled over hagrids discolored and swollen face dragon blood dripped gently onto his waistcoat in the silence i see yeah said hagrid bit o o fresh air yeh know yes a gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by said umbridge sweetly the small patch of hagrids face that wa not black or purple flushed well change o scene yeh know mountain scenery said umbridge swiftly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she know harry thought desperately mountain hagrid repeated clearly thinking fast nope south of france fer me bit o sun an an sea really said umbridge you do not have much of a tan yeah well sensitive skin said hagrid attempting an ingratiating smile harry noticed that two of his teeth had been knocked out umbridge looked at him coldly his smile faltered then she hoisted her handbag a little higher into the crook of her arm and said i shall of course be informing the minister of your late return righ said hagrid nodding you ought to know too that a high inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teacher so i daresay we shall meet again soon enough she turned sharply and marched back to the door you are inspectin u hagrid echoed blankly looking after her oh yes said umbridge softly looking back at him with her hand on the door handle the ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teacher hagrid good night she left closing the door behind her with a snap harry made to pull off the invisibility cloak but hermione seized his wrist page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling not yet she breathed in his ear she might not be gone yet hagrid seemed to be thinking the same way he stumped across the room and pulled back the curtain an inch or so she is goin back ter the castle he said in a low voice blimey inspectin people is she yeah said harry pulling the cloak off trelawneys on probation already um what sort of thing are you planning to do with u in class hagrid asked hermione oh don you worry abou that i have got a great load o lesson planned said hagrid enthusiastically scooping up his dragon steak from the table and slapping it over his eye again i have bin keepin a couple o creature saved fer yer owl year you wait they are somethin really special erm special in what way asked hermione tentatively i am not sayin said hagrid happily i don want ter spoil the surprise look hagrid said hermione urgently dropping all pretense professor umbridge will not be at all happy if you bring anything to class that is too dangerous dangerous said hagrid looking genially bemused don be silly i wouldn give yeh anythin dangerous i mean all righ they can look after themselves hagrid you have got to pas umbridges inspection and to do that it would really be better if she saw you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling teaching u how to look after porlocks how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehog stuff like that said hermione earnestly but thas not very interestin hermione said hagrid the stuff i have gots much more impressive i have bin bringin them on fer year i reckon i have got the ony domestic herd in britain hagrid please said hermione a note of real desperation in her voice umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teacher she think are too close to dumbledore please hagrid teach u something dull that is bound to come up in our owl but hagrid merely yawned widely and cast a oneeyed look of longing toward the vast bed in the corner lisen it bin a long day an it late he said patting hermione gently on the shoulder so that her knee gave way and hit the floor with a thud oh sorry he pulled her back up by the neck of her robe look don you go worryin abou me i promise yeh i have got really good stuff planned fer yer lesson now i am back now you lot had better get back up to the castle an don forget ter wipe yer footprint out behind yeh i do not know if you got through to him said ron a short while later when having checked that the coast wa clear they walked back up to the castle through the thickening snow leaving no trace behind them due to the obliteration charm hermione wa performing a they went then ill go back again tomorrow said hermione determinedly ill plan his lesson for him if i have to i do not care if she throw out trelawney but she is not taking hagrid page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the eye of the snake hermione plowed her way back to hagrids cabin through two foot of snow on sunday morning harry and ron wanted to go with her but their mountain of homework had reached an alarming height again so they grudgingly remained in the common room trying to ignore the gleeful shout drifting up from the ground outside where student were enjoying themselves skating on the frozen lake tobogganing and worst of all bewitching snowball to zoom up to gryffindor tower and rap hard on the window oy bellowed ron finally losing patience and sticking his head out of the window i am a prefect and if one more snowball hit this window ouch he withdrew his head sharply his face covered in snow it fred and george he said bitterly slamming the window behind him git page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hermione returned from hagrids just before lunch shivering slightly her robe damp to the knee so said ron looking up when she entered got all his lesson planned for him well i tried she said dully sinking into a chair beside harry she pulled out her wand and gave it a complicated little wave so that hot air streamed out of the tip she then pointed this at her robe which began to steam a they dried out he wa not even there when i arrived i wa knocking for at least half an hour and then he came stumping out of the forest harry groaned the forbidden forest wa teeming with the kind of creature most likely to get hagrid the sack what is he keeping in there did he say asked harry no said hermione miserably he say he want them to be a surprise i tried to explain about umbridge but he just doe not get it he kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls than chimaera oh i do not think he got a chimaera she added at the appalled look on harry and ron face but that is not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get egg i do not know how many time i told him he would be better off following grubblyplanks plan i honestly do not think he listened to half of what i said he in a bit of a funny mood you know he still will not say how he got all those injury hagrids reappearance at the staff table at breakfast next day wa not greeted by enthusiasm from all student some like fred george and lee roared with delight and sprinted up the aisle between the gryffindor and hufflepuff table to wring hagrids page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling enormous hand others like parvati and lavender exchanged gloomy look and shook their head harry knew that many of them preferred professor grubbly plank lesson and the worst of it wa that a very small unbiased part of him knew that they had good reason grubblyplanks idea of an interesting class wa not one where there wa a risk that somebody might have their head ripped off it wa with a certain amount of apprehension that harry ron and hermione headed down to hagrids on tuesday heavily muffled against the cold harry wa worried not only about what hagrid might have decided to teach them but also about how the rest of the class particularly malfoy and his crony would behave if umbridge wa watching them however the high inquisitor wa nowhere to be seen a they struggled through the snow toward hagrid who stood waiting for them on the edge of the forest he did not present a reassuring sight the bruise that had been purple on saturday night were now tinged with green and yellow and some of his cut still seemed to be bleeding harry could not understand this had hagrid perhaps been attacked by some creature whose venom prevented the wound it inflicted from healing a though to complete the ominous picture hagrid wa carrying what looked like half a dead cow over his shoulder were workin in here today hagrid called happily to the approaching student jerking his head back at the dark tree behind him bit more sheltered anyway they prefer the dark what prefers the dark harry heard malfoy say sharply to crabbe and goyle a trace of panic in his voice what did he say prefers the dark did you hear page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry remembered the only occasion on which malfoy had entered the forest before now he had not been very brave then either he smiled to himself after the quidditch match anything that caused malfoy discomfort wa all right with him ready said hagrid happily looking around at the class right well i have bin savin a trip inter the forest fer yer fifth year thought wed go an see these creature in their natural habitat now what were studyin today is pretty rare i reckon i am probably the ony person in britain who is managed ter train them and you are sure they are trained are you said malfoy the panic in his voice even more pronounced now only it would not be the first time you would brought wild stuff to class would it the slytherins murmured agreement and a few gryffindors looked a though they thought malfoy had a fair point too course they are trained said hagrid scowling and hoisting the dead cow a little higher on his shoulder so what happened to your face then demanded malfoy mind yer own business said hagrid angrily now if yehve finished askin stupid question follow me he turned and strode straight into the forest nobody seemed much disposed to follow harry glanced at ron and hermione who sighed but nodded and the three of them set off after hagrid leading the rest of the class they walked for about ten minute until they reached a place where the tree stood so closely together that page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa a dark a twilight and there wa no snow on the ground at all hagrid deposited his half a cow with a grunt on the ground stepped back and turned to face his class again most of whom were creeping toward him from tree to tree peering around nervously a though expecting to be set upon at any moment gather roun gather roun said hagrid encouragingly now they will be attracted by the smell o the meat but i am goin ter give them a call anyway because they will like ter know it me he turned shook his shaggy head to get the hair out of his face and gave an odd shrieking cry that echoed through the dark tree like the call of some monstrous bird nobody laughed most of them looked too scared to make a sound hagrid gave the shrieking cry again a minute passed in which the class continued to peer nervously over their shoulder and around tree for a first glimpse of whatever it wa that wa coming and then a hagrid shook his hair back for a third time and expanded his enormous chest harry nudged ron and pointed into the black space between two gnarled yew tree a pair of blank white shining eye were growing larger through the gloom and a moment later the dragonish face neck and then skeletal body of a great black winged horse emerged from the darkness it looked around at the class for a few second swishing it long black tail then bowed it head and began to tear flesh from the dead cow with it pointed fang a great wave of relief broke over harry here at last wa proof that he had not imagined these creature that they were real hagrid knew about them too he page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling looked eagerly at ron but ron wa still staring around into the tree and after a few second he whispered why doe not hagrid call again most of the rest of the class were wearing expression a confused and nervously expectant a ron and were still gazing everywhere but at the horse standing foot from them there were only two other people who seemed to be able to see them a stringy slytherin boy standing just behind goyle wa watching the horse eating with an expression of great distaste on his face and neville whose eye were following the swishing progress of the long black tail oh an here come another one said hagrid proudly a a second black horse appeared out of the dark tree folded it leathery wing closer to it body and dipped it head to gorge on the meat now put yer hand up who can see them immensely pleased to feel that he wa at last going to understand the mystery of these horse harry raised his hand hagrid nodded at him yeah yeah i knew you would be able ter harry he said seriously an you too neville eh an excuse me said malfoy in a sneering voice but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing for answer hagrid pointed at the cow carcass on the ground the whole class stared at it for a few second then several people gasped and parvati squealed harry understood why bit of flesh stripping themselves away from the bone and vanishing into thin air had to look very odd indeed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what is doing it parvati demanded in a terrified voice retreating behind the nearest tree what is eating it thestrals said hagrid proudly and hermione gave a soft oh of comprehension at harrys shoulder hogwarts ha got a whole herd of them in here now who know but they are really really unlucky interrupted parvati looking alarmed they are supposed to bring all sort of horrible misfortune on people who see them professor trelawney told me once no no no said hagrid chuckling thas jus superstition that is they aren unlucky they are dead clever an useful course this lot don get a lot o work it mainly jus pullin the school carriage unless dumbledores takin a long journey an don want ter apparate an here is another couple look two more horse came quietly out of the tree one of them passing very close to parvati who shivered and pressed herself closer to the tree saying i think i felt something i think it near me don worry it won hurt yeh said hagrid patiently righ now who can tell me why some o you can see them an some can not hermione raised her hand go on then said hagrid beaming at her the only people who can see thestrals she said are people who have seen death page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling thas exactly right said hagrid solemnly ten point ter gryffindor now thestrals hem hem professor umbridge had arrived she wa standing a few foot away from harry wearing her green hat and cloak again her clipboard at the ready hagrid who had never heard umbridge s fake cough before wa gazing in some concern at the closest thestral evidently under the impression that it had made the sound hem hem oh hello hagrid said smiling having located the source of the noise you received the note i sent to your cabin this morning said umbridge in the same loud slow voice she had used with him earlier a though she wa addressing somebody both foreign and very slow telling you that i would be inspecting your lesson oh yeah said hagrid brightly glad yeh found the place all righ well a you can see or i do not know can you were doin thestrals today i am sorry said umbridge loudly cupping her hand around her ear and frowning what did you say hagrid looked a little confused er thestralsl he said loudly big er winged horse yeh know he flapped his gigantic arm hopefully professor umbridge raised her eyebrow at him and muttered page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a she made a note on her clipboard ha to resort to crude sign language well anyway said hagrid turning back to the class and looking slightly flustered erm what wa i sayin appears to have poor short term memory muttered umbridge loudly enough for everyone to hear her draco malfoy looked a though christmas had come a month early hermione on the other hand had turned scarlet with suppressed rage oh yeah said hagrid throwing an uneasy glance at umbridges clipboard but plowing on valiantly yeah i wa going to tell yeh how come we got a herd yeah so we started off with a male an five female this one he patted the first horse to have appeared name o tenebrus he my special favorite fir one born here in the forest are you aware umbridge said loudly interrupting him that the ministry of magic ha classified thestrals a dangerous harrys heart sank like a stone but hagrid merely chuckled thestrals aren dangerous all righ they might take a bite outta you if yeh really annoy them show sign of pleasure at idea of violence muttered umbridge scribbling on her clipboard again no come on said hagrid looking a little anxious now i mean a dogll bite if yeh bait it won it but thestrals have jus got a bad reputation because o the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling death thing people used ter think they were bad omen didn they jus didn understand did they umbridge did not answer she finished writing her last note then looked up at hagrid and said again very loudly and slowly please continue teaching a usual i am going to walk she mimed walking malfoy and pansy parkinson were having silent fit of laughter among the student she pointed around at individual member of the class and ask them question she pointed at her mouth to indicate talking hagrid stared at her clearly at a complete loss to understand why she wa acting a though he did not understand normal english hermione had tear of fury in her eye now you hag you evil hag she whispered a umbridge walked toward pansy parkinson i know what you are doing you awful twisted vicious erm anyway said hagrid clearly struggling to regain the flow of his lesson so thestrals yeah well there is load o good stuff abou them do you find said professor umbridge in a ringing voice to pansy parkinson that you are able to understand professor hagrid when he talk just like hermione pansy had tear in her eye but these were tear of laughter indeed her answer wa almost incoherent because she wa trying to suppress her giggle no because well it sound like grunting a lot of the time umbridge scribbled on her clipboard the few unbruised bit of hagrid s face flushed but he tried to act a though he had not heard pansy answer page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling er yeah good stuff abou thestrals well once they are tamed like this lot yehll never be lost again mazin sens o direction jus tell them where yeh want ter go assuming they can understand you of course said malfoy loudly and pansy parkinson collapsed in a fit of renewed giggle professor umbridge smiled indulgently at them and then turned to neville you can see the thestrals longbottom can you she said neville nodded whom did you see die she asked her tone indifferent my my grandad said neville and what do you think of them she said waving her stubby hand at the horse who by now had stripped a great deal of the carcass down to bone erm said neville nervously with a glance at hagrid well they are er okay student are too intimidated to admit they are frightened muttered umbridge making another note on her clipboard no said neville looking upset no i am not scared of them it quite all right said umbridge patting neville on the shoulder with what she evidently intended to be an understanding smile though it looked more like a leer to harry well hagrid she turned to look up at him again speaking once more in that loud slow page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling voice i think i have got enough to be getting along with you will receive she mimed taking something from the air in front of her the result of your inspection she pointed at the clipboard in ten day time she held up ten stubby little finger then her smile wider and more toadlike than ever before beneath her green hat she bustled from their midst leaving malfoy and pansy parkinson in fit of laughter hermione actually shaking with fury and neville looking confused and upset that foul lying twisting old gargoyle stormed hermione half an hour later a they made their way back up to the castle through the channel they had made earlier in the snow you see what she is up to it her thing about halfbreeds all over again she is trying to make out hagrids some kind of dimwitted troll just because he had a giantess for a mother and oh it not fair that really wa not a bad lesson at all i mean all right if it had been blastended skrewts again but thestrals are fine in fact for hagrid they are really good umbridge said they are dangerous said ron well it like hagrid said they can look after themselves said hermione impatiently and i suppose a teacher like grubblyplank would not usually show them to u before newt level but well they are very interesting are not they the way some people can see them and some can not i wish i could do you harry asked her quietly she looked horrorstruck oh harry i am sorry no of course i do not that wa a really stupid thing to say page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it okay he said quickly do not worry i am surprised so many people could see them said ron three in a class yeah weasley we were just wondering said a malicious voice nearby unheard by any of them in the muffling snow malfoy crabbe and goyle were walking along right behind them dyou reckon if you saw someone snuff it you would be able to see the quaffle better he crabbe and goyle roared with laughter a they pushed past on their way to the castle and then broke into a chorus of weasley is our king ron ear turned scarlet ignore them just ignore them intoned hermione pulling out her wand and performing the charm to produce hot air again so that she could melt them an easier path through the untouched snow between them and the greenhouse december arrived bringing with it more snow and a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth year ron and hermione s prefect duty also became more and more onerous a christmas approached they were called upon to supervise the decoration of the castle you try putting up tinsel when peeve ha got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it said ron to watch over first and second year spending their break time inside because of the bitter cold and they are cheeky little snotrags you know we definitely were not that rude when we were in first year said ron and to patrol the corridor in shift with argus filch who suspected that the holiday spirit might show itself in an outbreak of wizard duel he got dung for brain that one said ron furiously they were so busy that hermione page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling had stopped knitting elf hat and wa fretting that she wa down to her last three all those poor elf i have not set free yet having to stay over during christmas because there are not enough hat harry who had not had the heart to tell her that dobby wa taking everything she made bent lower over his history of magic essay in any case he did not want to think about christmas for the first time in his school career he very much wanted to spend the holiday away from hogwarts between his quidditch ban and worry about whether or not hagrid wa going to be put on probation he felt highly resentful toward the place at the moment the only thing he really looked forward to were the da meeting and they would have to stop over the holiday a nearly everybody in the da would be spending the time with their family hermione wa going skiing with her parent something that greatly amused ron who had never before heard of muggles strapping narrow strip of wood to their foot to slide down mountain ron meanwhile wa going home to the burrow harry endured several day of jealousy before ron said in response to harry asking how ron wa going to get home for christmas but you are coming too did not i say mum wrote and told me to invite you week ago hermione rolled her eye but harrys spirit soared the thought of christmas at the burrow wa truly wonderful only slightly marred by harrys guilty feeling that he would not be able to spend the holiday with sirius he wondered whether he could possibly persuade mr weasley to invite his godfather for the festivity too but apart from the fact that he doubted whether dumbledore would permit sirius to leave grimmauld place he could not help but feel that mr page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling weasley might not want him they were so often at loggerhead sirius had not contacted harry at all since his last appearance in the fire and although harry knew that with umbridge on the constant watch it would be unwise to attempt to contact him he did not like to think of sirius alone in his mother old house perhaps pulling a lonely cracker with kreacher harry arrived early in the room of requirement for the last da meeting before the holiday and wa very glad he had because when the lamp burst into light he saw that dobby had taken it upon himself to decorate the place for christmas he could tell the elf had done it because nobody else would have strung a hundred golden bauble from the ceiling each showing a picture of harrys face and bearing the legend have a very harry christmas harry had only just managed to get the last of them down before the door creaked open and luna lovegood entered looking dreamy a always hello she said vaguely looking around at what remained of the decoration these are nice did you put them up no said harry it wa dobby the houseelf mistletoe said luna dreamily pointing at a large clump of white berry placed almost over harrys head he jumped out from under it good thinking said luna very seriously it often infested with nargles harry wa saved the necessity of asking what nargles were by the arrival of angelina katie and alicia all three of them were breathless and looked very cold page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well said angelina dully pulling off her cloak and throwing it into a corner we have replaced you replaced me said harry blankly you and fred and george she said impatiently we have got another seeker who said harry quickly ginny weasley said katie harry gaped at her yeah i know said angelina pulling out her wand and flexing her arm but she is pretty good actually nothing on you of course she said throwing him a very dirty look but a we can not have you harry bit back the retort he wa longing to utter did she imagine for a second that he did not regret his expulsion from the team a hundred time more than she did and what about the beater he asked trying to keep his voice even andrew kirke said alicia without enthusiasm and jack sloper neither of them are brilliant but compared with the rest of the idiot who turned up the arrival of ron hermione and neville brought this depressing discussion to an end and within five minute the room wa full enough to prevent him seeing angelinas burning reproachful look okay he said calling them all to order i thought this evening we should just go over the thing we have page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling done so far because it the last meeting before the holiday and there is no point starting anything new right before a threeweek break were not doing anything new said zacharias smith in a disgruntled whisper loud enough to carry through the room if id known that i would not have come were all really sorry harry did not tell you then said fred loudly several people sniggered harry saw cho laughing and felt the familiar swooping sensation in his stomach a though he had missed a step going downstairs we can practice in pair said harry well start with the impediment jinx just for ten minute then we can get out the cushion and try stunning again they all divided up obediently harry partnered neville a usual the room wa soon full of intermittent cry of impedimental people froze for a minute or so during which their partner would stare aimlessly around the room watching other pair at work then would unfreeze and take their turn at the jinx neville had improved beyond all recognition after a while when harry had unfrozen three time in a row he had neville join ron and hermione again so that he could walk around the room and watch the others when he passed cho she beamed at him he resisted the temptation to walk past her several more time after ten minute on the impediment jinx they laid out cushion all over the floor and started practicing stunning again space wa really too confined to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling allow them all to work this spell at once half the group observed the others for a while then swapped over harry felt himself positively swelling with pride a he watched them all true neville did stun padma patil rather than dean at whom he had been aiming but it wa a much closer miss than usual and everybody else had made enormous progress at the end of an hour harry called a halt you are getting really good he said beaming around at them when we get back from the holiday we can start doing some of the big stuff maybe even patronuses there wa a murmur of excitement the room began to clear in the usual two and three most people wished harry a happy christmas a they went feeling cheerful he collected up the cushion with ron and hermione and stacked them neatly away ron and hermione left before he did he hung back a little because cho wa still there and he wa hoping to receive a merry christmas from her no you go on he heard her say to her friend marietta and his heart gave a jolt that seemed to take it into the region of his adam apple he pretended to be straightening the cushion pile he wa quite sure they were alone now and waited for her to speak instead he heard a hearty sniff he turned and saw cho standing in the middle of the room tear pouring down her face wha he did not know what to do she wa simply standing there cry silently page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what is up he said feebly she shook her head and wiped her eye on her sleeve i am sorry she said thickly i suppose it just learning all this stuff it just make me wonder whether if he would known it all he would still be alive harrys heart sank right back past it usual spot and settled somewhere around his navel he ought to have known she wanted to talk about cedric he did know this stuff harry said heavily he wa really good at it or he could never have got to the middle of that maze but if voldemort really want to kill you you do not stand a chance she hiccuped at the sound of voldemorts name but stared at harry without flinching you survived when you were just a baby she said quietly yeah well said harry wearily moving toward the door i do not know why nor doe anyone else so it nothing to be proud of oh do not go said cho sounding tearful again i am really sorry to get all upset like this i did not mean to she hiccuped again she wa very pretty even when her eye were red and puffy harry felt thoroughly miserable he would have been so pleased just with a merry christmas i know it must be horrible for you she said mopping her eye on her sleeve again me mentioning cedric when you saw him die i suppose you just want to forget about it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry did not say anything to this it wa quite true but he felt heartless saying it you are a rreally good teacher you know said cho with a watery smile i have never been able to stun anything before thanks said harry awkwardly they looked at each other for a long moment harry felt a burning desire to run from the room and at the same time a complete inability to move his foot mistletoe said cho quietly pointing at the ceiling over his head yeah said harry his mouth wa very dry it probably full of nargles though what are nargles no idea said harry she had moved closer his brain seemed to have been stunned you would have to ask loony luna i mean cho made a funny noise halfway between a sob and a laugh she wa even nearer him now he could have counted the freckle on her nose i really like you harry he could not think a tingling sensation wa spreading throughout him paralyzing his arm leg and brain she wa much too close he could see every tear clinging to her eyelash page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he returned to the common room half an hour later to find hermione and ron in the best seat by the fire nearly everybody else had gone to bed hermione wa writing a very long letter she had already filled half a roll of parchment which wa dangling from the edge of the table ron wa lying on the hearthrug trying to finish his transfiguration homework what kept you he asked a harry sank into the armchair next to hermione s harry did not answer he wa in a state of shock half of him wanted to tell ron and hermione what had just happened but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave are you all right harry hermione asked peering at him over the tip of her quill harry gave a halfhearted shrug in truth he did not know whether he wa all right or not what is up said ron hoisting himself up on his elbow to get a clearer view of harry what is happened harry did not quite know how to set about telling them and still wa not sure whether he wanted to just a he had decided not to say anything hermione took matter out of his hand is it cho she asked in a businesslike way did she corner you after the meeting numbly surprised harry nodded ron sniggered breaking off when hermione caught his eye so er what did she want he asked in a mock casual voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she harry began rather hoarsely he cleared his throat and tried again she er did you kiss asked hermione briskly ron sat up so fast that he sent his ink bottle flying all over the rug disregarding this completely he stared avidly at harry well he demanded harry looked from ron expression of mingled curiosity and hilarity to hermiones slight frown and nodded ha ron made a triumphant gesture with his fist and went into a raucous peal of laughter that made several timidlooking second year over beside the window jump a reluctant grin spread over harrys face a he watched ron rolling around on the hearthrug hermione gave ron a look of deep disgust and returned to her letter well ron said finally looking up at harry how wa it harry considered for a moment wet he said truthfully ron made a noise that might have indicated jubilation or disgust it wa hard to tell because she wa cry harry continued heavily oh said ron his smile fading slightly are you that bad at kissing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling do not know said harry who had not considered this and immediately felt rather worried maybe i am of course you are not said hermione absently still scribbling away at her letter how do you know said ron in a sharp voice because cho spends half her time cry these day said hermione vaguely she doe it at mealtime in the loo all over the place you would think a bit of kissing would cheer her up said ron grinning ron said hermione in a dignified voice dipping the point of her quill into her ink pot you are the most insensitive wart i have ever had the misfortune to meet what is that supposed to mean said ron indignantly what sort of person cry while someone is kissing them yeah said harry slightly desperately who doe hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face do not you understand how chos feeling at the moment she asked no said harry and ron together hermione sighed and laid down her quill well obviously she is feeling very sad because of cedric dying then i expect she is feeling confused because she liked cedric and now she like harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and she can not work out who she like best then she will be feeling guilty thinking it an insult to cedrics memory to be kissing harry at all and she will be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she start going out with harry and she probably can not work out what her feeling toward harry are anyway because he wa the one who wa with cedric when cedric died so that is all very mixed up and painful oh and she is afraid she is going to be thrown off the ravenclaw quidditch team because she is been flying so badly a slightly stunned silence greeted the end of this speech then ron said one person can not feel all that at once they would explode just because you have got the emotional range of a teaspoon doe not mean we all have said hermione nastily picking up her quill again she wa the one who started it said harry i would not have she just sort of came at me and next thing she is cry all over me i did not know what to do do not blame you mate said ron looking alarmed at the very thought you just had to be nice to her said hermione looking up anxiously you were were not you well said harry an unpleasant heat creeping up his face i sort of patted her on the back a bit hermione looked a though she wa restraining herself from rolling her eye with extreme difficulty well i suppose it could have been worse she said are you going to see her again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ill have to will not i said harry we have got da meeting have not we you know what i mean said hermione impatiently harry said nothing hermione s word opened up a whole new vista of frightening possibility he tried to imagine going somewhere with cho hogsmeade perhaps and being alone with her for hour at a time of course she would have been expecting him to ask her out after what had just happened the thought made his stomach clench painfully oh well said hermione distantly buried in her letter once more you will have plenty of opportunity to ask her what if he doe not want to ask her said ron who had been watching harry with an unusually shrewd expression on his face do not be silly said hermione vaguely harrys liked her for age have not you harry he did not answer yes he had liked cho for age but whenever he had imagined a scene involving the two of them it had always featured a cho who wa enjoying herself a opposed to a cho who wa sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder who re you writing the novel to anyway ron asked hermione trying to read the bit of parchment now trailing on the floor hermione hitched it up out of sight viktor krum page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling how many other viktors do we know ron said nothing but looked disgruntled they sat in silence for another twenty minute ron finishing his transfiguration essay with many snort of impatience and crossingsout hermione writing steadily to the very end of the parchment rolling it up carefully and sealing it and harry staring into the fire wishing more than anything that sirius head would appear there and give him some advice about girl but the fire merely crackled lower and lower until the redhot ember crumbled into ash and looking around harry saw that they were yet again the last in the common room well night said hermione yawning widely and she set off up the girl staircase what doe she see in krum ron demanded a he and harry climbed the boy stair well said harry considering the matter i spose he older is not he and he an international quidditch player yeah but apart from that said ron sounding aggravated i mean he a grouchy git is not he bit grouchy yeah said harry whose thought were still on cho they pulled off their robe and put on pajama in silence dean seamus and neville were already asleep harry put his glass on his bedside table and got into bed but did not pull the hanging closed around his fourposter instead he stared at the patch of starry sky visible through the window next to nevilles bed if he had known this time last night page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling that in twentyfour hour time he would have kissed cho chang night grunted ron from somewhere to his right night said harry maybe next time if there wa a next time she would be a bit happier he ought to have asked her out she had probably been expecting it and wa now really angry with him or wa she lying in bed still cry about cedric he did not know what to think hermiones explanation had made it all seem more complicated rather than easier to understand that is what they should teach u here he thought turning over onto his side how girl brain work it would be more useful than divination anyway neville snuffled in his sleep an owl hooted somewhere out in the night harry dreamed he wa back in the da room cho wa accusing him of luring her there under false pretense she said that he had promised her a hundred and fifty chocolate frog card if she showed up harry protested cho shouted cedric gave me load of chocolate frog card look and she pulled out fistful of card from inside her robe and threw them into the air and then turned into hermione who said you did promise her you know harry i think you would better give her something else instead how about your firebolt and harry wa protesting that he could not give cho his firebolt because umbridge had it and anyway the whole thing wa ridiculous he would only come to the da room to put up some christmas bauble shaped like dobbys head the dream changed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling his body felt smooth powerful and flexible he wa gliding between shining metal bar across dark cold stone he wa flat against the floor sliding along on his belly it wa dark yet he could see object around him shimmering in strange vibrant color he wa turning his head at first glance the corridor wa empty but no a man wa sitting on the floor ahead his chin drooping onto his chest his outline gleaming in the dark harry put out his tongue he tasted the man scent on the air he wa alive but drowsing sitting in front of a door at the end of the corridor harry longed to bite the man but he must master the impulse he had more important work to do but the man wa stirring a silvery cloak fell from his leg a he jumped to his foot and harry saw his vibrant blurred outline towering above him saw a wand withdrawn from a belt he had no choice he reared high from the floor and struck once twice three time plunging his fang deeply into the man flesh feeling his rib splinter beneath his jaw feeling the warm gush of blood the man wa yelling in pain then he fell silent he slumped backward against the wall blood wa splattering onto the floor his forehead hurt terribly it wa aching fit to burst harry harry he opened his eye every inch of his body wa covered in icy sweat his bedcover were twisted all around him like a straitjacket he felt a though a whitehot poker wa being applied to his forehead page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harryl ron wa standing over him looking extremely frightened there were more figure at the foot of harrys bed he clutched his head in his hand the pain wa blinding him he rolled right over and vomited over the edge of the mattress he really ill said a scared voice should we call someone harry harryl he had to tell ron it wa very important that he tell him taking great gulp of air harry pushed himself up in bed willing himself not to throw up again the pain halfblinding him your dad he panted his chest heaving your dad been attacked what said ron uncomprehendingly your dad he been bitten it serious there wa blood everywhere i am going for help said the same scared voice and harry heard footstep running out of the dormitory harry mate said ron uncertainly you you were just dreaming no said harry furiously it wa crucial that ron understand it wa not a dream not an ordinary dream i wa there i saw it i did it he could hear seamus and dean muttering but did not care the pain in his forehead wa subsiding slightly though he wa still sweating and shivering page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling feverishly he retched again and ron leapt backward out of the way harry you are not well he said shakily nevilles gone for help i am fine harry choked wiping his mouth on his pajama and shaking uncontrollably there is nothing wrong with me it your dad you have got to worry about we need to find out where he is he bleeding like mad i wa it wa a huge snake he tried to get out of bed but ron pushed him back into it dean and seamus were still whispering somewhere nearby whether one minute passed or ten harry did not know he simply sat there shaking feeling the pain recede very slowly from his scar then there were hurried footstep coming up the stair and he heard nevilles voice again over here professor professor mcgonagall came hurrying into the dormitory in her tartan dressing gown her glass perched lopsidedly on the bridge of her bony nose what is it potter where doe it hurt he had never been so pleased to see her it wa a member of the order of the phoenix he needed now not someone fussing over him and prescribing useless potion it ron dad he said sitting up again he been attacked by a snake and it serious i saw it happen what do you mean you saw it happen said professor mcgonagall her dark eyebrow contracting page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i do not know i wa asleep and then i wa there you mean you dreamed this no said harry angrily would none of them understand i wa having a dream at first about something completely different something stupid and then this interrupted it it wa real i did not imagine it mr weasley wa asleep on the floor and he wa attacked by a gigantic snake there wa a load of blood he collapsed someone is got to find out where he is professor mcgonagall wa gazing at him through her lopsided spectacle a though horrified at what she wa seeing i am not lying and i am not mad harry told her his voice rising to a shout i tell you i saw it happen i believe you potter said professor mcgonagall curtly put on your dressinggown were going to see the headmaster page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling st mungos hospital for magical malady and injury harry wa so relieved that she wa taking him seriously that he did not hesitate but jumped out of bed at once pulled on his dressing gown and pushed his glass back onto his nose weasley you ought to come too said professor mcgonagall they followed professor mcgonagall past the silent figure of neville dean and seamus out of the dormitory down the spiral stair into the common room through the portrait hole and off along the fat lady moonlit corridor harry felt a though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment he wanted to run to yell for dumbledore mr weasley wa bleeding a they walked along so sedately and what if those fang harry tried hard not to think my fang had been poisonous they passed mr norris who turned her lamplike eye upon them and hissed faintly but professor mcgonagall said shoo mr page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling norris slunk away into the shadow and in a few minute they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to dumbledores office fizzing whizbee said professor mcgonagall the gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that wa moving continuously upward like a spiral escalator the three of them stepped onto the moving stair the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upward in tight circle until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin though it wa now well past midnight there were voice coming from inside the room a positive babble of them it sounded a though dumbledore wa entertaining at least a dozen people professor mcgonagall rapped three time with the griffin knocker and the voice ceased abruptly a though someone had switched them all off the door opened of it own accord and professor mcgonagall led harry and ron inside the room wa in half darkness the strange silver instrument standing on table were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puff of smoke a they usually did the portrait of old headmaster and headmistress covering the wall were all snoozing in their frame behind the door a magnificent redandgold bird the size of a swan dozed on it perch with it head under it wing oh it you professor mcgonagall and ah dumbledore wa sitting in a highbacked chair behind his desk he leaned forward into the pool of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling candlelight illuminating the paper laid out before him he wa wearing a magnificently embroidered purpleandgold dressing gown over a snowywhite nightshirt but seemed wide awake his penetrating lightblue eye fixed intently upon professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore potter ha had a well a nightmare said professor mcgonagall he say it wa not a nightmare said harry quickly professor mcgonagall looked around at harry frowning slightly very well then potter you tell the headmaster about it i well i wa asleep said harry and even in his terror and his desperation to make dumbledore understand he felt slightly irritated that the headmaster wa not looking at him but examining his own interlocked finger but it wa not an ordinary dream it wa real i saw it happen he took a deep breath ron dad mr weasley ha been attacked by a giant snake the word seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them slightly ridiculous even comic there wa a pause in which dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling ron looked from harry to dumbledore whitefaced and shocked how did you see this dumbledore asked quietly still not looking at harry well i do not know said harry rather angrily what did it matter inside my head i suppose page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you misunderstand me said dumbledore still in the same calm tone i mean can you remember er where you were positioned a you watched this attack happen were you perhaps standing beside the victim or else looking down on the scene from above this wa such a curious question that harry gaped at dumbledore it wa almost a though he knew i wa the snake he said i saw it all from the snake point of view nobody else spoke for a moment then dumbledore now looking at ron who wa still wheyfaced said in a new and sharper voice is arthur seriously injured yes said harry emphatically why were they all so slow on the uptake did they not realize how much a person bled when fang that long pierced their side and why could dumbledore not do him the courtesy of looking at him but dumbledore stood up so quickly that harry jumped and addressed one of the old portrait hanging very near the ceiling everard he said sharply and you too dilys a sallowfaced wizard with short black bang and an elderly witch with long silver ringlet in the frame beside him both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleep opened their eye immediately you were listening said dumbledore the wizard nodded the witch said naturally page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the man ha red hair and glass said dumbledore everard you will need to raise the alarm make sure he is found by the right people both nodded and moved sideways out of their frame but instead of emerging in neighboring picture a usually happened at hogwarts neither reappeared one frame now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain the other a handsome leather armchair harry noticed that many of the other headmaster and mistress on the wall though snoring and drooling most convincingly kept sneaking peek at him under their eyelid and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked everard and dilys were two of hogwarts s most celebrated head dumbledore said now sweeping around harry ron and professor mcgonagall and approaching the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door their renown is such that both have portrait hanging in other important wizarding institution a they are free to move between their own portrait they can tell u what may be happening elsewhere but mr weasley could be anywhere said harry please sit down all three of you said dumbledore a though harry had not spoken everard and dilys may not be back for several minute professor mcgonagall if you could draw up extra chair professor mcgonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it three chair appeared out of thin air straightbacked and wooden quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchair that dumbledore had conjured back at harrys hearing harry sat down watching dumbledore over his shoulder dumbledore wa now page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling stroking fawkes plumed golden head with one finger the phoenix awoke immediately he stretched his beautiful head high and observed dumbledore through bright dark eye we will need said dumbledore very quietly to the bird a warning there wa a flash of fire and the phoenix had gone dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instrument whose function harry had never known carried it over to his desk sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand the instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noise tiny puff of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top dumbledore watched the smoke closely his brow furrowed and after a few second the tiny puff became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air a serpent head grew out of the end of it opening it mouth wide harry wondered whether the instrument wa confirming his story he looked eagerly at dumbledore for a sign that he wa right but dumbledore did not look up naturally naturally murmured dumbledore apparently to himself still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise but in essence divided harry could make neither head nor tail of this question the smoke serpent however split itself instantly into two snake both coiling and undulating in the dark air with a look of grim satisfaction dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand the clinking noise slowed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and died and the smoke serpent grew faint became a formless haze and vanished dumbledore replaced the instrument upon it spindly little table harry saw many of the old headmaster in the portrait follow him with their eye then realizing that harry wa watching them hastily pretend to be sleeping again harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument wa for but before he could do so there wa a shout from the top of the wall to their right the wizard called everard had reappeared in his portrait panting slightly dumbledore what news said dumbledore at once i yelled until someone came running said the wizard who wa mopping his brow on the curtain behind him said id heard something moving downstairs they were not sure whether to believe me but went down to check you know there are no portrait down there to watch from anyway they carried him up a few minute later he doe not look good he covered in blood i ran along to elfrida craggs portrait to get a good view a they left good said dumbledore a ron made a convulsive movement i take it dilys will have seen him arrive then and moment later the silverringletted witch had reappeared in her picture too she sank coughing into her armchair and said yes they have taken him to st mungos dumbledore they carried him past under my portrait he look bad thank you said dumbledore he looked around at professor mcgonagall page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling minerva i need you to go and wake the other weasley child of course professor mcgonagall got up and moved swiftly to the door harry cast a sideways glance at ron who wa now looking terrified and dumbledore what about molly said professor mcgonagall pausing at the door that will be a job for fawkes when he ha finished keeping a lookout for anybody approaching said dumbledore but she may already know that excellent clock of hers harry knew dumbledore wa referring to the clock that told not the time but the whereabouts and condition of the various weasley family member and with a pang he thought that mr weasleys hand must even now be pointing at mortal peril but it wa very late mr weasley wa probably asleep not watching the clock and he felt cold a he remembered mr weasleys boggart turning into mr weasleys lifeless body his glass askew blood running down his face but mr weasley wa not going to die he could not dumbledore wa now rummaging in a cupboard behind harry and ron he emerged from it carrying a blackened old kettle which he placed carefully upon his desk he raised his wand and murmured portus for a moment the kettle trembled glowing with an odd blue light then it quivered to a rest a solidly black a ever dumbledore marched over to another portrait this time of a cleverlooking wizard with a pointed beard page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling who had been painted wearing the slytherin color of green and silver and wa apparently sleeping so deeply that he could not hear dumbledore s voice when he attempted to rouse him phineas phineas and now the subject of the portrait lining the room were no longer pretending to be asleep they were shifting around in their frame the better to watch what wa happening when the cleverlooking wizard continued to feign sleep some of them shouted his name too phineas phineas phineas he could not pretend any longer he gave a theatrical jerk and opened his eye wide did someone call i need you to visit your other portrait again phineas said dumbledore i have got another message visit my other portrait said phineas in a reedy voice giving a long fake yawn his eye traveling around the room and focusing upon harry oh no dumbledore i am too tired tonight something about phineas s voice wa familiar to harry where had he heard it before but before he could think the portrait on the surrounding wall broke into a storm of protest insubordination sir roared a corpulent rednosed wizard brandishing his fist dereliction of duty page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling we are honorbound to give service to the present headmaster of hogwarts cried a fraillooking old wizard whom harry recognized a dumbledores predecessor armando dippet shame on you phineas shall i persuade him dumbledore called a gimlet eyed witch raising an unusually thick wand that looked not unlike a birch rod oh very well said the wizard called phineas eyeing this wand slightly apprehensively though he may well have destroyed my picture by now he done most of the family sirius know not to destroy your portrait said dumbledore and harry realized immediately where he had heard phineas s voice before issuing from the apparently empty frame in his bedroom in grimmauld place you are to give him the message that arthur weasley ha been gravely injured and that his wife child and harry potter will be arriving at his house shortly do you understand arthur weasley injured wife and child and harry potter coming to stay recited phineas in a bored voice yes yes very well he sloped away into the frame of the portrait and disappeared from view at the very moment that the study door opened again fred george and ginny were ushered inside by professor mcgonagall all three of them looking disheveled and shocked still in their night thing harry what is going on asked ginny who looked frightened professor mcgonagall say you saw dad hurt page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling your father ha been injured in the course of his work for the order of the phoenix said dumbledore before harry could speak he ha been taken to st mungos hospital for magical malady and injury i am sending you back to sirius house which is much more convenient for the hospital than the burrow you will meet your mother there how are we going asked fred looking shaken floo powder no said dumbledore floo powder is not safe at the moment the network is being watched you will be taking a portkey he indicated the old kettle lying innocently on his desk we are just waiting for phineas nigellus to report back i wish to be sure that the coast is clear before sending you there wa a flash of flame in the very middle of the office leaving behind a single golden feather that floated gently to the floor it is fawkes warning said dumbledore catching the feather a it fell she must know you are out of your bed minerva go and head her off tell her any story professor mcgonagall wa gone in a swish of tartan he say hell be delighted said a bored voice behind dumbledore the wizard called phineas had reappeared in front of his slytherin banner my greatgreatgrandson ha always had odd taste in houseguest come here then dumbledore said to harry and the weasleys and quickly before anyone else join u page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry and the others gathered around dumbledores desk you have all used a portkey before asked dumbledore and they nodded each reaching out to touch some part of the blackened kettle good on the count of three then one two it happened in a fraction of a second in the infinitesimal pause before dumbledore said three harry looked up at him they were very close together and dumbledores clear blue gaze moved from the portkey to harrys face at once harrys scar burned whitehot a though the old wound had burst open again and unbidden unwanted but terrifyingly strong there rose within harry a hatred so powerful he felt for that instant that he would like nothing better than to strike to bite to sink his fang into the man before him three he felt a powerful jerk behind his navel the ground vanished from beneath his foot his hand wa glued to the kettle he wa banging into the others a all sped forward in a swirl of color and a rush of wind the kettle pulling them onward and then his foot hit the ground so hard that his knee buckled the kettle clattered to the ground and somewhere close at hand a voice said back again the blood traitor brat is it true their father dying out roared a second voice harry scrambled to his foot and looked around they had arrived in the gloomy basement kitchen of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling number twelve grimmauld place the only source of light were the fire and one guttering candle which illuminated the remains of a solitary supper kreacher wa disappearing through the door to the hall looking back at them malevolently a he hitched up his loincloth sirius wa hurrying toward them all looking anxious he wa unshaven and still in his day clothes there wa also a slightly mundunguslike whiff of stale drink about him what is going on he said stretching out a hand to help ginny up phineas nigellus said arthur been badly injured ask harry said fred yeah i want to hear this for myself said george the twin and ginny were staring at him kreachers footstep had stopped on the stair outside it wa harry began this wa even worse than telling mcgonagall and dumbledore i had a a kind of vision and he told them all that he had seen though he altered the story so that it sounded a though he had watched from the sideline a the snake attacked rather than from behind the snake own eye ron who wa still very white gave him a fleeting look but did not speak when harry had finished fred george and ginny continued to stare at him for a moment harry did not know whether he wa imagining it or not but he fancied there wa something accusatory in their look well if they were going to blame him for just seeing the attack he wa glad he had not told them that he had been inside the snake at the time page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling is mum here said fred turning to sirius she probably doe not even know what is happened yet said sirius the important thing wa to get you away before umbridge could interfere i expect dumbledores letting molly know now we have got to go to st mungos said ginny urgently she looked around at her brother they were of course still in their pajama sirius can you lend u cloak or anything hang on you can not go tearing off to st mungos said sirius course we can go to st mungos if we want said fred with a mulish expression he our dad and how are you going to explain how you knew arthur wa attacked before the hospital even let his wife know what doe that matter said george hotly it matter because we do not want to draw attention to the fact that harry is having vision of thing that are happening hundred of mile away said sirius angrily have you any idea what the ministry would make of that information fred and george looked a though they could not care le what the ministry made of anything ron wa still whitefaced and silent ginny said somebody else could have told u we could have heard it somewhere other than harry like who said sirius impatiently listen your dad been hurt while on duty for the order and the circumstance are fishy enough without his child page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling knowing about it second after it happened you could seriously damage the order we do not care about the dumb order shouted fred it our dad dying were talking about yelled george your father knew what he wa getting into and he will not thank you for messing thing up for the order said sirius angrily in his turn this is how it is this is why you are not in the order you do not understand there are thing worth dying for easy for you to say stuck here bellowed fred i do not see you risking your neck the little color remaining in sirius face drained from it he looked for a moment a though he would quite like to hit fred but when he spoke it wa in a voice of determined calm i know it hard but we have all got to act a though we do not know anything yet we have got to stay put at least until we hear from your mother all right fred and george still looked mutinous ginny however took a few step over to the nearest chair and sank into it harry looked at ron who made a funny movement somewhere between a nod and shrug and they sat down too the twin glared at sirius for another minute then took seat on either side of ginny that is right said sirius encouragingly come on let u all let u all have a drink while were waiting accio butterbeeri he raised his wand a he spoke and half a dozen bottle came flying toward them out of the pantry skidded along the table scattering the debris of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sirius meal and stopped neatly in front of the six of them they all drank and for a while the only sound were those of the crackling of the kitchen fire and the soft thud of their bottle on the table harry wa only drinking to have something to do with his hand his stomach wa full of horrible hot bubbling guilt they would not be here if it were not for him they would all still be asleep in bed and it wa no good telling himself that by raising the alarm he had ensured that mr weasley wa found because there wa also the inescapable business of it being he who had attacked mr weasley in the first place do not be stupid you have not got fang he told himself trying to keep calm though the hand on his butterbeer bottle wa shaking you were lying in bed you were not attacking anyone but then what just happened in dumbledores office he asked himself i felt like i wanted to attack dumbledore too he put the bottle down on the table a little harder than he meant to so that it slopped over onto the table no one took any notice then a burst of fire in midair illuminated the dirty plate in front of them and a they gave cry of shock a scroll of parchment fell with a thud onto the table accompanied by a single golden phoenix tail feather fawkes said sirius at once snatching up the parchment that is not dumbledores writing it must be a message from your mother here he thrust the letter into george hand who ripped it open and read aloud dad is still alive i am setting out for st mungos now stay where you are i will send news a soon a i can mum page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling george looked around the table still alive he said slowly but that make it sound he did not need to finish the sentence it sounded to harry too a though mr weasley wa hovering somewhere between life and death still exceptionally pale ron stared at the back of his mother letter a though it might speak word of comfort to him fred pulled the parchment out of george hand and read it for himself then looked up at harry who felt his hand shaking on his butterbeer bottle again and clenched it more tightly to stop the trembling if harry had ever sat through a longer night than this one he could not remember it sirius suggested once that they all go to bed but without any real conviction and the weasleys look of disgust were answer enough they mostly sat in silence around the table watching the candle wick sinking lower and lower into liquid wax now and then raising bottle to their lip speaking only to check the time to wonder aloud what wa happening and to reassure one another that if there wa bad news they would know straightaway for mr weasley must long since have arrived at st mungos fred fell into a doze his head sagging sideways onto his shoulder ginny wa curled like a cat on her chair but her eye were open harry could see them reflecting the firelight ron wa sitting with his head in his hand whether awake or asleep it wa impossible to tell and he and sirius looked at each other every so often intruder upon the family grief waiting waiting and then at ten past five in the morning by ron watch the kitchen door swung open and mr page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling weasley entered the kitchen she wa extremely pale but when they all turned to look at her fred ron and harry halfrising from their chair she gave a wan smile he going to be all right she said her voice weak with tiredness he sleeping we can all go and see him later bill sitting with him now he going to take the morning off work fred fell back into his chair with his hand over his face george and ginny got up walked swiftly over to their mother and hugged her ron gave a very shaky laugh and downed the rest of his butterbeer in one breakfast said sirius loudly and joyfully jumping to his foot where is that accursed houseelf kreacher kreacher but kreacher did not answer the summons oh forget it then muttered sirius counting the people in front of him so it breakfast for let u see seven bacon and egg i think and some tea and toast harry hurried over to the stove to help he did not want to intrude upon the weasleys happiness and he dreaded the moment when mr weasley would ask him to recount his vision however he had barely taken plate from the dresser when mr weasley lifted them out of his hand and pulled him into a hug i do not know what would have happened if it had not been for you harry she said in a muffled voice they might not have found arthur for hour and then it would have been too late but thanks to you he alive and dumbledores been able to think up a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling good cover story for arthur being where he wa you have no idea what trouble he would have been in otherwise look at poor sturgis harry could hardly stand her gratitude but fortunately she soon released him to turn to sirius and thank him for looking after her child through the night sirius said that he wa very pleased to have been able to help and hoped they would all stay with him a long a mr weasley wa in hospital oh sirius i am so grateful they think hell be there a little while and it would be wonderful to be nearer of course that might mean were here for christmas the more the merrier said sirius with such obvious sincerity that mr weasley beamed at him threw on an apron and began to help with breakfast sirius harry muttered unable to stand it a moment longer can i have a quick word er now he walked into the dark pantry and sirius followed without preamble harry told his godfather every detail of the vision he had had including the fact that he himself had been the snake who had attacked mr weasley when he paused for breath sirius said did you tell dumbledore this yes said harry impatiently but he did not tell me what it meant well he doe not tell me anything anymore i am sure he would have told you if it wa anything to worry about said sirius steadily page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but that is not all said harry in a voice only a little above a whisper sirius i i think i am going mad back in dumbledores office just before we took the portkey for a couple of second there i thought i wa a snake i felt like one my scar really hurt when i wa looking at dumbledore sirius i wanted to attack him he could only see a sliver of sirius face the rest wa in darkness it must have been the aftermath of the vision that is all said sirius you were still thinking of the dream or whatever it wa and it wa not that said harry shaking his head it wa like something rose up inside me like there is a snake inside me you need to sleep said sirius firmly you are going to have breakfast and then go upstairs to bed and then you can go and see arthur after lunch with the others you are in shock harry you are blaming yourself for something you only witnessed and it lucky you did witness it or arthur might have died just stop worrying he clapped harry on the shoulder and left the pantry leaving harry standing alone in the dark everyone but harry spent the rest of the morning sleeping he went up to the bedroom he had shared with ron over the summer but while ron crawled into bed and wa asleep within minute harry sat fully clothed hunched against the cold metal bar of the bedstead keeping himself deliberately uncomfortable determined not to fall into a doze terrified that he might become the serpent again in his sleep and awake to find that he had attacked ron page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling or else slithered through the house after one of the others when ron woke up harry pretended to have enjoyed a refreshing nap too their trunk arrived from hogwarts while they were eating lunch so that they could dress a muggles for the trip to st mungos everybody except harry wa riotously happy and talkative a they changed out of their robe into jean and sweatshirt and they greeted tonks and mad eye who had turned up to escort them across london gleefully laughing at the bowler hat madeye wa wearing at an angle to conceal his magical eye and assuring him truthfully that tonks whose hair wa short and bright pink again would attract far le attention on the underground tonks wa very interested in harrys vision of the attack on mr weasley something he wa not remotely interested in discussing there is not any seer blood in your family is there she inquired curiously a they sat side by side on a train rattling toward the heart of the city no said harry thinking of professor trelawney and feeling insulted no said tonks musingly no i suppose it not really prophecy you are doing is it i mean you are not seeing the future you are seeing the present it odd is not it useful though harry did not answer fortunately they got out at the next stop a station in the very heart of london and in the bustle of leaving the train he wa able to allow fred and george to get between himself and tonks who wa leading the way they all followed her up the escalator moody clunking along at the back of the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling group his bowler tilted low and one gnarled hand stuck in between the button of his coat clutching his wand harry thought he sensed the concealed eye staring hard at him trying to deflect more question about his dream he asked madeye where st mungos wa hidden not far from here grunted moody a they stepped out into the wintry air on a broad storelined street packed with christmas shopper he pushed harry a little ahead of him and stumped along just behind harry knew the eye wa rolling in all direction under the tilted hat wa not easy to find a good location for a hospital nowhere in diagon alley wa big enough and we could not have it underground like the ministry unhealthy in the end they managed to get hold of a building up here theory wa sick wizard could come and go and just blend in with the crowd he seized harrys shoulder to prevent them being separated by a gaggle of shopper plainly intent on nothing but making it into a nearby shop full of electrical gadget here we go said moody a moment later they had arrived outside a large oldfashioned red brick department store called purge and dowse ltd the place had a shabby miserable air the window display consisted of a few chipped dummy with their wig askew standing at random and modeling fashion at least ten year out of date large sign on all the dusty door read closed for refurbishment harry distinctly heard a large woman laden with plastic shopping bag say to her friend a they passed it never open that place right said tonks beckoning them forward to a window displaying nothing but a particularly ugly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling female dummy whose false eyelash were hanging off and who wa modeling a green nylon pinafore dress everybody ready they nodded clustering around her moody gave harry another shove between the shoulder blade to urge him forward and tonks leaned close to the glass looking up at the very ugly dummy and said her breath steaming up the glass wotcher were here to see arthur weasley for a split second harry thought how absurd it wa for tonks to expect the dummy to hear her talking that quietly through a sheet of glass when there were bus rumbling along behind her and all the racket of a street full of shopper then he reminded himself that dummy could not hear anyway next second his mouth opened in shock a the dummy gave a tiny nod beckoned it jointed finger and tonks had seized ginny and mr weasley by the elbow stepped right through the glass and vanished fred george and ron stepped after them harry glanced around at the jostling crowd not one of them seemed to have a glance to spare for window display a ugly a purge and dowse ltds nor did any of them seem to have noticed that six people had just melted into thin air in front of them cmon growled moody giving harry yet another poke in the back and together they stepped forward through what felt like a sheet of cool water emerging quite warm and dry on the other side there wa no sign of the ugly dummy or the space where she had stood they had arrived in what seemed to be a crowded reception area where row of witch and wizard sat upon rickety wooden chair some looking perfectly normal and perusing outof p a g e harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling date copy of witch weekly others sporting gruesome disfigurement such a elephant trunk or extra hand sticking out of their chest the room wa scarcely le quiet than the street outside for many of the patient were making very peculiar noise a sweatyfaced witch in the center of the front row who wa fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the daily prophet kept letting off a highpitched whistle a steam came pouring out of her mouth and a grubbylooking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and with each clang his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ear and hold it steady witch and wizard in limegreen robe were walking up and down the row asking question and making note on clipboard like umbridges harry noticed the emblem embroidered on their chest a wand and bone crossed are they doctor he asked ron quietly doctor said ron looking startled those muggle nutter that cut people up nah they are healer over here called mr weasley over the renewed clanging of the warlock in the corner and they followed her to the queue in front of a plump blonde witch seated at a desk marked inquiry the wall behind her wa covered in notice and poster saying thing like a clean cauldron keep potion from becoming poison and antidote are antidonts unless approved by a qualified healer there wa also a large portrait of a witch with long silver ringlet that wa labelled dilys derwent page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling st mungos healer headmistress of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry iii dilys wa eyeing the weasley party a though counting them when harry caught her eye she gave a tiny wink walked sideways out of her portrait and vanished meanwhile at the front of the queue a young wizard wa performing an odd onthespot jig and trying in between yelp of pain to explain his predicament to the witch behind the desk it these ouch shoe my brother gave me ow they are eating my ouch foot look at them there must be some kind of aargh jinx on them and i can not aaaaargh get them off he hopped from one foot to the other a though dancing on hot coal the shoe do not prevent you reading do they said the blonde witch irritably pointing at a large sign to the left of her desk you want spell damage fourth floor just like it say on the floor guide next the wizard hobbled and pranced sideways out of the way the weasley party moved forward a few step and harry read the floor guide artifact accident ground floor cauldron explosion wand backfiring broom crash etc page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling creatureinduced injury first floor bite sting burn embedded spine etc magical bug second floor contagious malady eg dragon pox vanishing sickness scrofungulus potion and plant poisoning third floor rash regurgitation uncontrollable giggling etc spell damage fourth floor unliftable jinx hex and incorrectly applied charm etc visitor tearoom and hospital shop fifth floor if you are unsure where to go incapable of normal speech or unable to remember why you are here our welcome witch will be pleased to help a very old stooped wizard with a hearing trumpet had shuffled to the front of the queue now i am here to see broderick bode he wheezed ward fortynine but i am afraid you are wasting your time said the witch dismissively he completely addled you know still think he a teapot next a harassedlooking wizard wa holding his small daughter tightly by the ankle while she flapped around his head using the immensely large feathery wing that had sprouted right out the back of her romper suit page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fourth floor said the witch in a bored voice without asking and the man disappeared through the double door beside the desk holding his daughter like an oddly shaped balloon next mr weasley moved forward to the desk hello she said my husband arthur weasley wa supposed to be moved to a different ward this morning could you tell u arthur weasley said the witch running her finger down a long list in front of her yes first floor second door on the right dai llewellyn ward thank you said mr weasley come on you lot they followed through the double door and along the narrow corridor beyond which wa lined with more portrait of famous healer and lit by crystal bubble full of candle that floated up on the ceiling looking like giant soapsuds more witch and wizard in limegreen robe walked in and out of the door they passed a foulsmelling yellow gas wafted into the passageway a they passed one door and every now and then they heard distant wailing they climbed a flight of stair and entered the creatureinduced injury corridor where the second door on the right bore the word dangerous dai llewellyn ward serious bite underneath this wa a card in a brass holder on which had been handwritten healerincharge hippocrates smethwyck trainee healer augustus pye well wait outside molly tonks said arthur will not want too many visitor at once it ought to be just the family first page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling madeye growled his approval of this idea and set himself with his back against the corridor wall his magical eye spinning in all direction harry drew back too but mr weasley reached out a hand and pushed him through the door saying do not be silly harry arthur want to thank you the ward wa small and rather dingy a the only window wa narrow and set high in the wall facing the door most of the light came from more shining crystal bubble clustered in the middle of the ceiling the wall were of panelled oak and there wa a portrait of a rather viciouslooking wizard on the wall captioned urquhart rackharrow inventor of the entrail expelling curse there were only three patient mr weasley wa occupying the bed at the far end of the ward beside the tiny window harry wa pleased and relieved to see that he wa propped up on several pillow and reading the daily prophet by the solitary ray of sunlight falling onto his bed he looked around a they walked toward him and seeing whom it wa beamed hello he called throwing the prophet aside bill just left molly had to get back to work but he say hell drop in on you later how are you arthur asked mr weasley bending down to kiss his cheek and looking anxiously into his face you are still looking a bit peaky i feel absolutely fine said mr weasley brightly holding out his good arm to give ginny a hug if they could only take the bandage off id be fit to go home why can not they take them off dad asked fred page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well i start bleeding like mad every time they try said mr weasley cheerfully reaching across for his wand which lay on his bedside cabinet and waving it so that six extra chair appeared at his bedside to seat them all it seems there wa some rather unusual kind of poison in that snake fang that keep wound open they are sure they will find an antidote though they say they have had much worse case than mine and in the meantime i just have to keep taking a bloodreplenishing potion every hour but that fellow over there he said dropping his voice and nodding toward the bed opposite in which a man lay looking green and sickly and staring at the ceiling bitten by a werewolf poor chap no cure at all a werewolf whispered mr weasley looking alarmed is he safe in a public ward should not he be in a private room it two week till full moon mr weasley reminded her quietly they have been talking to him this morning the healer you know trying to persuade him hell be able to lead an almost normal life i said to him did not mention name of course but i said i knew a werewolf personally very nice man who find the condition quite easy to manage what did he say asked george said he would give me another bite if i did not shut up said mr weasley sadly and that woman over there he indicated the only other occupied bed which wa right beside the door will not tell the healer what bit her which make u all think it must have been something she wa handling illegally whatever it wa took a real chunk out of her leg very nasty smell when they take off the dressing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling so you going to tell u what happened dad asked fred pulling his chair closer to the bed well you already know do not you said mr weasley with a significant smile at harry it very simple id had a very long day dozed off got sneaked up on and bitten is it in the prophet you being attacked asked fred indicating the newspaper mr weasley had cast aside no of course not said mr weasley with a slightly bitter smile the ministry would not want everyone to know a dirty great serpent got arthur said mr weasley warningly got er me mr weasley said hastily though harry wa quite sure that wa not what he had meant to say so where were you when it happened dad asked george that is my business said mr weasley though with a small smile he snatched up the daily prophet shook it open again and said i wa just reading about willy widdershinss arrest when you arrived you know willy turned out to be behind those regurgitating toilet last summer one of his jinx backfired the toilet exploded and they found him lying unconscious in the wreckage covered from head to foot in when you say you were on duty fred interrupted in a low voice what were you doing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you heard your father whispered mr weasley we are not discussing this here go on about willy widdershins arthur well do not ask me how but he actually got off on the toilet charge said mr weasley grimly i can only suppose gold changed hand you were guarding it were not you said george quietly the weapon the thing youknow who is after george be quiet snapped mr weasley anyway said mr weasley in a raised voice this time willys been caught selling biting doorknob to muggles and i do not think hell be able to worm his way out of it because according to this article two muggles have lost finger and are now in st mungos for emergency bone regrowth and memory modification just think of it muggles in st mungos i wonder which ward they are in and he looked eagerly around a though hoping to see a signpost did not you say youknow who is got a snake harry asked fred looking at his father for a reaction a massive one you saw it the night he returned did not you that is enough said mr weasley crossly madeye and tonks are outside arthur they want to come and see you and you lot can wait outside she added to her child and harry you can come and say goodbye afterward go on page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they trooped back into the corridor madeye and tonks went in and closed the door of the ward behind them fred raised his eyebrow fine he said coolly rummaging in his pocket be like that do not tell u anything looking for these said george holding out what looked like a tangle of fleshcolored string you read my mind said fred grinning let u see if st mungos put imperturbable charm on it ward door shall we he and george disentangled the string and separated five extendable ear from each other fred and george handed them around harry hesitated to take one go on harry take it you saved dad life if anyones got the right to eavesdrop on him it you grinning in spite of himself harry took the end of the string and inserted it into his ear a the twin had done okay go fred whispered the fleshcolored string wriggled like long skinny worm then snaked under the door for a few second harry could hear nothing then he heard tonks whispering a clearly a though she were standing right beside him they searched the whole area but they could not find the snake anywhere it just seems to have vanished after it attacked you arthur but you knowwho can not have expected a snake to get in can he page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i reckon he sent it a a lookout growled moody because he not had any luck so far ha he no i reckon he trying to get a clearer picture of what he facing and if arthur had not been there the beast would have had much more time to look around so potter say he saw it all happen yes said mr weasley she sounded rather uneasy you know dumbledore seems almost to have been waiting for harry to see something like this yeah well said moody there is something funny about the potter kid we all know that dumbledore seemed worried about harry when i spoke to him this morning whispered mr weasley course he worried growled moody the boy seeing thing from inside youknow who is snake obviously potter doe not realize what that mean but if you know who is possessing him harry pulled the extendable ear out of his own his heart hammering very fast and heat rushing up his face he looked around at the others they were all staring at him the string still trailing from their ear looking suddenly fearful page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling christmas on the closed ward wa this why dumbledore would no longer meet harrys eye did he expect to see voldemort staring out of them afraid perhaps that their vivid green might turn suddenly to scarlet with catlike slit for pupil harry remembered how the snakelike face of voldemort had once forced itself out of the back of professor quirrells head and he ran his hand over the back of his own wondering what it would feel like if voldemort burst out of his skull he felt dirty contaminated a though he were carrying some deadly germ unworthy to sit on the underground train back from the hospital with innocent clean people whose mind and body were free of the taint of voldemort he had not merely seen the snake he had been the snake he knew it now and then a truly terrible thought occurred to him a memory bobbing to the surface of his mind one that made his inside writhe and squirm like serpent page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what is he after apart from follower stuff he can only get by stealth like a weapon something he did not have last time i am the weapon harry thought and it wa a though poison were pumping through his vein chilling him bringing him out in a sweat a he swayed with the train through the dark tunnel i am the one voldemorts trying to use that is why they have got guard around me everywhere i go it not for my protection it for other people only it not working they can not have someone on me all the time at hogwarts i did attack mr weasley last night it wa me voldemort made me do it and he could be inside me listening to my thought right now are you all right harry dear whispered mr weasley leaning across ginny to speak to him a the train rattled along through it dark tunnel you do not look very well are you feeling sick they were all watching him he shook his head violently and stared up at an advertisement for home insurance harry dear are you sure you are all right said mr weasley in a worried voice a they walked around the unkempt patch of grass in the middle of grimmauld place you look ever so pale are you sure you slept this morning you go upstairs to bed right now and you can have a couple of hour sleep before dinner all right he nodded here wa a readymade excuse not to talk to any of the others which wa precisely what he wanted so when she opened the front door he proceeded straight past the troll leg umbrella stand page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and up the stair and hurried into his and ron bedroom here he began to pace up and down past the two bed and phineas nigelluss empty portrait his brain teeming and seething with question and ever more dreadful idea how had he become a snake perhaps he wa an animagus no he could not be he would know perhaps voldemort wa an animagus yes thought harry that would fit he would turn into a snake of course and when he possessing me then we both transform that still doe not explain how come i got to london and back to my bed in the space of about five minute though but then voldemort s about the most powerful wizard in the world apart from dumbledore it probably no problem at all to him to transport people like that and then with a terrible stab of panic he thought but this is insane if voldemorts possessing me i am giving him a clear view into the headquarters of the order of the phoenix right now hell know who is in the order and where sirius is and i have heard load of stuff i should not have everything sirius told me the first night i wa here there wa only one thing for it he would have to leave grimmauld place straightaway he would spend christmas at hogwarts without the others which would keep them safe over the holiday at least but no that would not do there were still plenty of people at hogwarts to maim and injure what if it wa seamus dean or neville next time he stopped his pacing and stood staring at phineas nigelluss empty frame a leaden sensation wa settling in the pit of his stomach he had no alternative he wa going to have page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling to return to privet drive cut himself off from other wizard entirely well if he had to do it he thought there wa no point hanging around trying with all his might not to think how the dursleys were going to react when they found him on their doorstep six month earlier than they had expected he strode over to his trunk slammed the lid shut and locked it then glanced around automatically for hedwig before remembering that she wa still at hogwarts well her cage would be one le thing to carry he seized one end of his trunk and had dragged it halfway toward the door when a sneaky voice said running away are we he looked around phineas nigellus had appeared upon the canvas of his portrait and wa leaning against the frame watching harry with an amused expression on his face not running away no said harry shortly dragging his trunk a few more foot across the room i thought said phineas nigellus stroking his pointed beard that to belong in gryffindor house you were supposed to be brave it look to me a though you would have been better off in my own house we slytherins are brave yes but not stupid for instance given the choice we will always choose to save our own neck it not my own neck i am saving said harry tersely tugging the trunk over a patch of particularly uneven motheaten carpet right in front of the door oh i see said phineas nigellus still stroking his beard this is no cowardly flight you are being noble page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry ignored him his hand wa on the doorknob when phineas nigellus said lazily i have a message for you from albus dumbledore harry spun around what is it stay where you are i have not moved said harry his hand still upon the doorknob so what is the message i have just given it to you dolt said phineas nigellus smoothly dumbledore say stay where you are why said harry eagerly dropping the end of his trunk why doe he want me to stay what else did he say nothing whatsoever said phineas nigellus raising a thin black eyebrow a though he found harry impertinent harrys temper rose to the surface like a snake rearing from long grass he wa exhausted he wa confused beyond measure he had experienced terror relief and then terror again in the last twelve hour and still dumbledore did not want to talk to him so that is it is it he said loudly stay there that is all anyone could tell me after i got attacked by those dementors too just stay put while the grownup sort it out harry we will not bother telling you anything though because your tiny little brain might not be able to cope with it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you know said phineas nigellus even more loudly than harry this is precisely why i loathed being a teacher young people are so infernally convinced that they are absolutely right about everything ha it not occurred to you my poor puffedup popinjay that there might be an excellent reason why the headmaster of hogwarts is not confiding every tiny detail of his plan to you have you never paused while feeling harddoneby to note that following dumbledore s order ha never yet led you into harm no no like all young people you are quite sure that you alone feel and think you alone recognize danger you alone are the only one clever enough to realize what the dark lord may be planning he is planning something to do with me then said harry swiftly did i say that said phineas nigellus idly examining his silk glove now if you will excuse me i have better thing to do than to listen to adolescent agonizing good day to you and he strolled into his frame and out of sight fine go then harry bellowed at the empty frame and tell dumbledore thanks for nothing the empty canvas remained silent fuming harry dragged his trunk back to the foot of his bed then threw himself facedown upon the motheaten cover his eye shut his body heavy and aching he felt he had journeyed mile and mile it seemed impossible that le than twentyfour hour ago cho chang had been approaching him under the mistletoe he wa so tired he wa scared to sleep yet he did not know how long he could fight it dumbledore had told him to stay that must mean page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he wa allowed to sleep but he wa scared what if it happened again he wa sinking into shadow it wa a though a film in his head had been waiting to start he wa walking down a deserted corridor toward a plain black door past rough stone wall torch and an open doorway onto a flight of stone step leading downstairs on the left he reached the black door but could not open it he stood gazing at it desperate for entry something he wanted with all his heart lay beyond a prize beyond his dream if only his scar would stop prickling then he would be able to think more clearly harry said ron voice from far far away mum say dinner ready but she will save you something if you want to stay in bed harry opened his eye but ron had already left the room he doe not want to be on his own with me harry thought not after what he heard moody say he supposed none of them would want him there anymore now that they knew what wa inside him he would not go down to dinner he would not inflict his company upon them he turned over onto his other side and after a while dropped back off to sleep waking much later in the early hour of the morning with his inside aching with hunger and ron snoring in the next bed squinting around the room he saw the dark outline of phineas nigellus standing again in his portrait and it occurred to harry that dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling had probably set phineas nigellus to watch over him in case he attacked somebody else the feeling of being unclean intensified he half wished he had not obeyed dumbledore and stayed if this wa how life wa going to be in grimmauld place from now on maybe he would be better off in privet drive after all everybody else spent the following morning putting up christmas decoration harry could not remember sirius ever being in such a good mood he wa actually singing carol apparently delighted that he wa to have company over christmas harry could hear his voice echoing up through the floor in the cold and empty drawing room where he wa sitting alone watching the sky outside the window growing whiter threatening snow all the time feeling a savage pleasure that he wa giving the others the opportunity to keep talking about him a they were bound to be doing when he heard mr weasley calling his name softly up the stair around lunchtime he retreated farther upstairs and ignored her it wa around six of the clock in the evening that the doorbell rang and mr black started screaming again assuming that mundungus or some other order member had come to call harry merely settled himself more comfortably against the wall of buckbeak the hippogriffs room where he wa hiding trying to ignore how hungry he felt a he fed buckbeak dead rat it came a a slight shock when somebody hammered hard on the door a few minute later i know you are in there said hermiones voice will you please come out i want to talk to you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what are you doing here harry asked her pulling open the door a buckbeak resumed his scratching at the strawstrewn floor for any fragment of rat he might have dropped i thought you were skiing with your mum and dad well to tell the truth skiing not really my thing said hermione so i have come for christmas there wa snow in her hair and her face wa pink with cold but do not tell ron that i told him it really good because he kept laughing so much anyway mum and dad are a bit disappointed but i have told them that everyone who is serious about the exam is staying at hogwarts to study they want me to do well they will understand anyway she said briskly let u go to your bedroom ron mum lit a fire in there and she is sent up sandwich harry followed her back to the second floor when he entered the bedroom he wa rather surprised to see both ron and ginny waiting for them sitting on ron bed i came on the knight bus said hermione airily pulling off her jacket before harry had time to speak dumbledore told me what had happened first thing this morning but i had to wait for term to end officially before setting off umbridge is already livid that you lot disappeared right under her nose even though dumbledore told her mr weasley wa in st mungos and he would given you all permission to visit so she sat down next to ginny and the two girl and ron looked up at harry how are you feeling asked hermione fine said harry stiffly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh do not lie harry she said impatiently ron and ginny say you have been hiding from everyone since you got back from st mungos they do do they said harry glaring at ron and ginny ron looked down at his foot but ginny seemed quite unabashed well you have she said and you will not look at any of u it you lot who will not look at me said harry angrily maybe you are taking it in turn to look and keep missing each other suggested hermione the corner of her mouth twitching very funny snapped harry turning away oh stop feeling all misunderstood said hermione sharply look the others have told me what you overheard last night on the extendable ear yeah growled harry his hand deep in his pocket a he watched the snow now falling thickly outside all been talking about me have you well i am getting used to it we wanted to talk to you harry said ginny but a you have been hiding ever since we got back i did not want anyone to talk to me said harry who wa feeling more and more nettled well that wa a bit stupid of you said ginny angrily seeing a you do not know anyone but me who is been possessed by youknowwho and i can tell you how it feel page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry remained quite still a the impact of these word hit him then he turned on the spot to face her i forgot he said lucky you said ginny coolly i am sorry harry said and he meant it so so do you think i am being possessed then well can you remember everything you have been doing ginny asked are there big blank period where you do not know what you have been up to harry racked his brain no he said then youknowwho ha not ever possessed you said ginny simply when he did it to me i could not remember what id been doing for hour at a time id find myself somewhere and not know how i got there harry hardly dared believe her yet his heart wa lightening almost in spite of himself that dream i had about your dad and the snake though harry you have had these dream before hermione said you had flash of what voldemort wa up to last year this wa different said harry shaking his head i wa inside that snake it wa like i wa the snake what if voldemort somehow transported me to london page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling one day said hermione sounding thoroughly exasperated you will read hogwarts a history and perhaps that will remind you that you can not apparate or disapparate inside hogwarts even voldemort could not just make you fly out of your dormitory harry you did not leave your bed mate said ron i saw you thrashing around in your sleep about a minute before we could wake you up harry started pacing up and down the room again thinking what they were all saying wa not only comforting it made sense without really thinking he took a sandwich from the plate on the bed and crammed it hungrily into his mouth i am not the weapon after all thought harry his heart swelled with happiness and relief and he felt like joining in a they heard sirius tramping past their door toward buckbeaks room singing god rest ye merry hippogriffs at the top of his voice how could he have dreamed of returning to privet drive for christmas sirius delight at having the house full again and especially at having harry back wa infectious he wa no longer their sullen host of the summer now he seemed determined that everyone should enjoy themselves a much if not more than they would have done at hogwarts and he worked tirelessly in the runup to christmas day cleaning and decorating with their help so that by the time they all went to bed on christmas eve the house wa barely recognizable the tarnished chandelier were no longer hung with cobweb but with garland of holly and gold and silver streamer magical snow glittered in heap over the threadbare carpet a great christmas tree obtained by mundungus and decorated with live fairy blocked page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sirius family tree from view and even the stuffed elf head on the hall wall wore father christmas hat and beard harry awoke on christmas morning to find a stack of present at the foot of his bed and ron already halfway through opening his own rather larger pile good haul this year he informed harry through a cloud of paper thanks for the broom compass it excellent beat hermiones she is got me a homework planner harry sorted through his present and found one with hermiones handwriting on it she had given him too a book that resembled a diary except that it said thing like do it today or later you will pay every time he opened a page sirius and lupin had given harry a set of excellent book entitled practical defensive magic and it use against the dark art which had superb moving color illustration of all the counterjinxes and hex it described harry flicked through the first volume eagerly he could see it wa going to be highly useful in his plan for the da hagrid had sent a furry brown wallet that had fang which were presumably supposed to be an antitheft device but unfortunately prevented harry putting any money in without getting his finger ripped off tonkss present wa a small working model of a firebolt which harry watched fly around the room wishing he still had his fullsize version ron had given him an enormous box of everyflavor bean mr and mr weasley the usual handknitted jumper and some mince pie and dobby a truly dreadful painting that harry suspected had been done by the elf himself he had just turned it upside down to see whether it looked better that page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling way when with a loud crack fred and george apparated at the foot of his bed merry christmas said george do not go downstairs for a bit why not said ron mum cry again said fred heavily percy sent back his christmas jumper without a note added george ha not asked how dad is or visited him or anything we tried to comfort her said fred moving around the bed to look at harrys portrait told her percy nothing more than a humongous pile of rat droppings did not work said george helping himself to a chocolate frog so lupin took over best let him cheer her up before we go down for breakfast i reckon what is that supposed to be anyway asked fred squinting at dobbys painting look like a gibbon with two black eye it harry said george pointing at the back of the picture say so on the back good likeness said fred grinning harry threw his new homework diary at him it hit the wall opposite and fell to the floor where it said happily if you have dotted the is and crossed the t then you may do whatever you pleasel they got up and dressed they could hear various inhabitant of the house calling merry christmas to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling each other on their way downstairs they met hermione thanks for the book harry she said happily i have been wanting that new theory of numerology for age and that perfume is really unusual ron no problem said ron who is that for anyway he added nodding at the neatly wrapped present she wa carrying kreacher said hermione brightly it had better not be clothes said ron warningly you know what sirius said kreacher know too much we can not set him free it is not clothes said hermione although if i had my way id certainly give him something to wear other than that filthy old rag no it a patchwork quilt i thought it would brighten up his bedroom what bedroom said harry dropping his voice to a whisper a they were passing the portrait of sirius mother well sirius say it not so much a bedroom more a kind of den said hermione apparently he sleep under the boiler in that cupboard off the kitchen mr weasley wa the only person in the basement when they arrived there she wa standing at the stove and sounded a though she had a bad head cold when she wished them merry christmas and they all averted their eye so this is kreachers bedroom said ron strolling over to a dingy door in the corner opposite the pantry which harry had never seen open page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes said hermione now sounding a little nervous er i think wed better knock ron rapped the door with his knuckle but there wa no reply he must be sneaking around upstairs he said and without further ado pulled open the door urgh harry peered inside most of the cupboard wa taken up with a very large and oldfashioned boiler but in the foot space underneath the pipe kreacher had made himself something that looked like a nest a jumble of assorted rag and smelly old blanket were piled on the floor and the small dent in the middle of it showed where kreacher curled up to sleep every night here and there among the material were stale bread crust and moldy old bit of cheese in a far corner glinted small object and coin that harry guessed kreacher had saved magpielike from sirius purge of the house and he had also managed to retrieve the silverframed family photograph that sirius had thrown away over the summer their glass might be shattered but still the little blackandwhite people inside them peered haughtily up at him including he felt a little jolt in his stomach the dark heavylidded woman whose trial he had witnessed in dumbledores pensieve bellatrix lestrange by the look of it hers wa kreacher s favorite photograph he had placed it to the fore of all the others and had mended the glass clumsily with spellotape i think ill just leave his present here said hermione laying the package neatly in the middle of the depression in the rag and blanket and closing the door quietly hell find it later that will be fine page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling come to think of it said sirius emerging from the pantry carrying a large turkey a they closed the cupboard door ha anyone actually seen kreacher lately i have not seen him since the night we came back here said harry you were ordering him out of the kitchen yeah said sirius frowning you know i think that is the last time i saw him too he must be hiding upstairs somewhere he could not have left could he said harry i mean when you said out maybe he thought you meant get out of the house no no houseelves can not leave unless they are given clothes they are tied to their family house said sirius they can leave the house if they really want to harry contradicted him dobby did he left the malfoys to give me warning two year ago he had to punish himself afterward but he still managed it sirius looked slightly disconcerted for a moment then said ill look for him later i expect ill find him upstairs cry his eye out over my mother old bloomer or something of course he might have crawled into the airing cupboard and died but i must not get my hope up fred george and ron laughed hermione however looked reproachful once they had had their christmas lunch the weasleys and harry and hermione were planning to pay mr weasley another visit escorted by madeye page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and lupin mundungus turned up in time for christmas pudding and trifle having managed to borrow a car for the occasion a the underground did not run on christmas day the car which harry doubted very much had been taken with the knowledge or consent of it owner had had a similar enlarging spell put upon it a the weasleys old ford anglia although normally proportioned outside ten people with mundungus driving were able to fit into it quite comfortably mr weasley hesitated at the point of getting inside harry knew that her disapproval of mundungus wa battling with her dislike of traveling without magic finally the cold outside and her childrens pleading triumphed and she settled herself into the backseat between fred and bill with good grace the journey to st mungos wa quite quick a there wa very little traffic on the road a small trickle of witch and wizard were creeping furtively up the otherwise deserted street to visit the hospital harry and the others got out of the car and mundungus drove off around the corner to wait for them they strolled casually toward the window where the dummy in green nylon stood then one by one stepped through the glass the reception area looked pleasantly festive the crystal orb that illuminated st mungos had been turned to red and gold so that they became gigantic glowing christmas bauble holly hung around every doorway and shining white christmas tree covered in magical snow and icicle glittered in every corner each topped with a gleaming gold star it wa le crowded than the last time they had been there although halfway across the room harry found himself shunted aside by a witch with a walnut jammed up her left nostril page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling family argument eh smirked the blonde witch behind the desk you are the third i have seen today spell damage fourth floor they found mr weasley propped up in bed with the remains of his turkey dinner on a tray in his lap and a rather sheepish expression on his face everything all right arthur asked mr weasley after they had all greeted mr weasley and handed over their present fine fine said mr weasley a little too heartily you er have not seen healer smethwyck have you no said mr weasley suspiciously why nothing nothing said mr weasley airily starting to unwrap his pile of gift well everyone had a good day what did you all get for christmas oh harry this is absolutely wonderful for he had just opened harrys gift of fusewire and screwdriver mr weasley did not seem entirely satisfied with mr weasleys answer a her husband leaned over to shake harrys hand she peered at the bandaging under his nightshirt arthur she said with a snap in her voice like a mousetrap you have had your bandage changed why have you had your bandage changed a day early arthur they told me they would not need doing until tomorrow what said mr weasley looking rather frightened and pulling the bed cover higher up his chest no no it nothing it i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he seemed to deflate under mr weasleys piercing gaze well now do not get upset molly but augustus pye had an idea he the trainee healer you know lovely young chap and very interested in um complementary medicine i mean some of these old muggle remedy well they are called stitch molly and they work very well on on muggle wound mr weasley let out an ominous noise somewhere between a shriek and a snarl lupin strolled away from the bed and over to the werewolf who had no visitor and wa looking rather wistfully at the crowd around mr weasley bill muttered something about getting himself a cup of tea and fred and george leapt up to accompany him grinning do you mean to tell me said mr weasley her voice growing louder with every word and apparently unaware that her fellow visitor were scurrying for cover that you have been messing about with muggle remedy not messing about molly dear said mr weasley imploringly it wa just just something pye and i thought wed try only most unfortunately well with these particular kind of wound it doe not seem to work a well a wed hoped meaning well well i do not know whether you know what what stitch are it sound a though you have been trying to sew your skin back together said mr weasley with a snort of mirthless laughter but even you arthur would not be that stupid page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i fancy a cup of tea too said harry jumping to his foot hermione ron and ginny almost sprinted to the door with him a it swung closed behind them they heard mr weasley shriek what do you mean that is the general idea typical dad said ginny shaking her head a they set off up the corridor stitch i ask you well you know they do work well on nonmagical wound said hermione fairly i suppose something in that snake venom dissolve them or something i wonder where the tearoom is fifth floor said harry remembering the sign over the welcome witch desk they walked along the corridor through a set of double door and found a rickety staircase lined with more portrait of brutallooking healer a they climbed it the various healer called out to them diagnosing odd complaint and suggesting horrible remedy ron wa seriously affronted when a medieval wizard called out that he clearly had a bad case of spattergroit and what is that supposed to be he asked angrily a the healer pursued him through six more portrait shoving the occupant out of the way it is a most grievous affliction of the skin young master that will leave you pockmarked and more gruesome even than you are now watch who you are calling gruesome said ron his ear turning red page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the only remedy is to take the liver of a toad bind it tight about your throat stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eel eye i have not got spattergroit but the unsightly blemish upon your visage young master they are freckle said ron furiously now get back in your own picture and leave me alone he rounded on the others who were all keeping determinedly straight face what floor this i think it the fifth said hermione nah it the fourth said harry one more but a he stepped onto the landing he came to an abrupt halt staring at the small window set into the double door that marked the start of a corridor signposted spell damage a man wa peering out at them all with his nose pressed against the glass he had wavy blond hair bright blue eye and a broad vacant smile that revealed dazzlingly white teeth blimey said ron also staring at the man oh my goodness said hermione suddenly sounding breathless professor lockhart their exdefense against the dark art teacher pushed open the door and moved toward them wearing a long lilac dressing gown page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well hello there he said i expect you would like my autograph would you ha not changed much ha he harry muttered to ginny who grinned er how are you professor said ron sounding slightly guilty it had been ron malfunctioning wand that had damaged professor lockharts memory so badly that he had landed here in the first place though a lockhart had been attempting to permanently wipe harry and ron memory at the time harrys sympathy wa limited i am very well indeed thank you said lockhart exuberantly pulling a rather battered peacockfeather quill from his pocket now how many autograph would you like i can do joinedup writing now you know er we do not want any at the moment thanks said ron raising his eyebrow at harry who asked professor should you be wandering around the corridor should not you be in a ward the smile faded slowly from lockharts face for a few moment he gazed intently at harry then he said have not we met er yeah we have said harry you used to teach u at hogwarts remember teach repeated lockhart looking faintly unsettled me did i and then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it wa rather alarming taught you everything you know i expect did i well how about those autograph then shall we say a round dozen page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you can give them to all your little friend then and nobody will be left out but just then a head poked out of a door at the far end of the corridor and a voice said gilderoy you naughty boy where have you wandered off to a motherly looking healer wearing a tinsel wreath in her hair came bustling up the corridor smiling warmly at harry and the others oh gilderoy you have got visitor how lovely and on christmas day too do you know he never get visitor poor lamb and i can not think why he such a sweetie are not you were doing autograph gilderoy told the healer with another glittering smile they want load of them will not take no for an answer i just hope we have got enough photograph listen to him said the healer taking lockharts arm and beaming fondly at him a though he were a precocious twoyearold he wa rather well known a few year ago we very much hope that this liking for giving autograph is a sign that his memory might be coming back a little bit will you step this way he in a closed ward you know he must have slipped out while i wa bringing in the christmas present the door usually kept locked not that he dangerous but she lowered her voice to a whisper bit of a danger to himself bless him doe not know who he is you see wanders off and can not remember how to get back it is nice of you to have come to see him er said ron gesturing uselessly at the floor above actually we were just er page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but the healer wa smiling expectantly at them and ron feeble mutter of going to have a cup of tea trailed away into nothingness they looked at one another rather hopelessly and then followed lockhart and his healer along the corridor let u not stay long ron said quietly the healer pointed her wand at the door of the janus thickey ward and muttered alohomora the door swung open and she led the way inside keeping a firm grasp on gilderoys arm until she had settled him into an armchair beside his bed this is our longterm resident ward she informed harry ron hermione and ginny in a low voice for permanent spell damage you know of course with intensive remedial potion and charm and a bit of luck we can produce some improvement gilderoy doe seem to be getting back some sense of himself and we have seen a real improvement in mr bode he seems to be regaining the power of speech very well though he is not speaking any language we recognize yet well i must finish giving out the christmas present ill leave you all to chat harry looked around this ward bore unmistakable sign of being a permanent home to it resident they had many more personal effect around their bed than in mr weasleys ward the wall around gilderoys headboard for instance wa papered with picture of himself all beaming toothily and waving at the new arrival he had autographed many of them to himself in disjointed childish writing the moment he had been deposited in his chair by the healer gilderoy pulled a fresh stack of photograph toward him seized a quill and started signing them all feverishly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you can put them in envelope he said to ginny throwing the signed picture into her lap one by one a he finished them i am not forgotten you know no i still receive a very great deal of fan mail gladys gudgeon writes weekly i just wish i knew why he paused looking faintly puzzled then beamed again and returned to his signing with renewed vigor i suspect it is simply my good look a sallowskinned mournfullooking wizard lay in the bed opposite staring at the ceiling he wa mumbling to himself and seemed quite unaware of anything around him two bed along wa a woman whose entire head wa covered in fur harry remembered something similar happening to hermione during their second year although fortunately the damage in her case had not been permanent at the far end of the ward flowery curtain had been drawn around two bed to give the occupant and their visitor some privacy here you are agnes said the healer brightly to the furryfaced woman handing her a small pile of christmas present see not forgotten are you and your son sent an owl to say he visiting tonight so that is nice is not it agnes gave several loud bark and look broderick you have been sent a potted plant and a lovely calendar with a different fancy hippogriff for each month they will brighten thing up will not they said the healer bustling along to the mumbling man setting a rather ugly plant with long swaying tentacle on the bedside cabinet and fixing the calendar to the wall with her wand and oh mr longbottom are you leaving already page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harrys head spun round the curtain had been drawn back from the two bed at the end of the ward and two visitor were walking back down the aisle between the bed a formidablelooking old witch wearing a long green dress a motheaten fox fur and a pointed hat decorated with what wa unmistakably a stuffed vulture and trailing behind her looking thoroughly depressed neville with a sudden rush of understanding harry realized who the people in the end bed must be he cast around wildly for some mean of distracting the others so that neville could leave the ward unnoticed and unquestioned but ron had looked up at the sound of the name longbottom too and before harry could stop him had called neville neville jumped and cowered a though a bullet had narrowly missed him it u neville said ron brightly getting to his foot have you seen lockharts here who have you been visiting friend of yours neville dear said nevilles grandmother graciously bearing down upon them all neville looked a though he would rather be anywhere in the world but here a dull purple flush wa creeping up his plump face and he wa not making eye contact with any of them ah yes said his grandmother looking closely at harry and sticking out a shriveled clawlike hand for him to shake yes yes i know who you are of course neville speaks most highly of you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling er thanks said harry shaking hand neville did not look at him but stared at his own foot the color deepening in his face all the while and you two are clearly weasleys mr longbottom continued proffering her hand regally to ron and ginny in turn yes i know your parent not well of course but fine people fine people and you must be hermione granger hermione looked rather startled that mr longbottom knew her name but shook hand all the same yes nevilles told me all about you helped him out of a few sticky spot have not you he a good boy she said casting a sternly appraising look down her rather bony nose at neville but he ha not got his father talent i am afraid to say and she jerked her head in the direction of the two bed at the end of the ward so that the stuffed vulture on her hat trembled alarmingly what said ron looking amazed harry wanted to stamp on ron foot but that sort of thing wa much harder to bring off unnoticed when you were wearing jean rather than robe is that your dad down the end neville what is this said mr longbottom sharply have not you told your friend about your parent neville neville took a deep breath looked up at the ceiling and shook his head harry could not remember ever feeling sorrier for anyone but he could not think of any way of helping neville out of the situation well it nothing to be ashamed of said mr longbottom angrily you should be proud neville page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling proud they did not give their health and their sanity so their only son would be ashamed of them you know i am not ashamed said neville very faintly still looking anywhere but at harry and the others ron wa now standing on tiptoe to look over at the inhabitant of the two bed well you have got a funny way of showing it said mr longbottom my son and his wife she said turning haughtily to harry ron hermione and ginny were tortured into insanity by youknow who is follower hermione and ginny both clapped their hand over their mouth ron stopped craning his neck to catch a glimpse of nevilles parent and looked mortified they were aurors you know and very well respected within the wizarding community mr longbottom went on highly gifted the pair of them i yes alice dear what is it nevilles mother had come edging down the ward in her nightdress she no longer had the plump happy looking face harry had seen in moody old photograph of the original order of the phoenix her face wa thin and worn now her eye seemed overlarge and her hair which had turned white wa wispy and deadlooking she did not seem to want to speak or perhaps she wa not able to but she made timid motion toward neville holding something in her outstretched hand again said mr longbottom sounding slightly weary very well alice dear very well neville take it whatever it is page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but neville had already stretched out his hand into which his mother dropped an empty droobles blowing gum wrapper very nice dear said nevilles grandmother in a falsely cheery voice patting his mother on the shoulder but neville said quietly thanks mum his mother tottered away back up the ward humming to herself neville looked around at the others his expression defiant a though daring them to laugh but harry did not think he would ever found anything le funny in his life well wed better get back sighed mr longbottom drawing on long green glove very nice to have met you all neville put that wrapper in the bin she must have given you enough of them to paper your bedroom by now but a they left harry wa sure he saw neville slip the wrapper into his pocket the door closed behind them i never knew said hermione who looked tearful nor did i said ron rather hoarsely nor me whispered ginny they all looked at harry i did he said glumly dumbledore told me but i promised i would not mention it that is what bellatrix lestrange got sent to azkaban for using the cruciatus curse on nevilles parent until they lost their mind page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling bellatrix lestrange did that whispered hermione horrified that woman kreachers got a photo of in his den there wa a long silence broken by lockharts angry voice look i did not learn joinedup writing for nothing you know page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling occlumency kreacher it transpired had been lurking in the attic sirius said he had found him up there covered in dust no doubt looking for more relic of the black family to hide in his cupboard though sirius seemed satisfied with this story it made harry uneasy kreacher seemed to be in a better mood on his reappearance his bitter muttering had subsided somewhat and he submitted to order more docilely than usual though once or twice harry caught the houseelf staring avidly at him always looking quickly away when he saw that harry had noticed harry did not mention his vague suspicion to sirius whose cheerfulness wa evaporating fast now that christmas wa over a the date of their departure back to hogwarts drew nearer he became more and more prone to what mr weasley called fit of the sullens in which he would become taciturn and grumpy often withdrawing to buckbeaks room for hour at a time his gloom seeped through the house oozing under doorway like some noxious gas so that all of them became infected by it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry did not want to leave sirius all alone again with only kreacher for company in fact for the first time in his life he wa not looking forward to returning to hogwarts going back to school would mean placing himself once again under the tyranny of dolores umbridge who had no doubt managed to force through another dozen decree in their absence then there wa no quidditch to look forward to now that he had been banned there wa every likelihood that their burden of homework would increase a the exam drew even nearer dumbledore remained a remote a ever in fact if it had not been for the da harry felt he might have gone to sirius and begged him to let him leave hogwarts and remain in grimmauld place then on the very last day of the holiday something happened that made harry positively dread his return to school harry dear said mr weasley poking her head into his and ron bedroom where the pair of them were playing wizard chess watched by hermione ginny and crookshanks could you come down to the kitchen professor snape would like a word with you harry did not immediately register what she had said one of his castle wa engaged in a violent tussle with a pawn of ron and he wa egging it on enthusiastically squash him squash him he only a pawn you idiot sorry mr weasley what did you say professor snape dear in the kitchen he would like a word page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harrys mouth fell open in horror he looked around at ron hermione and ginny all of whom were gaping back at him crookshanks whom hermione had been restraining with difficulty for the past quarter of an hour leapt gleefully upon the board and set the piece running for cover squealing at the top of their voice snape said harry blankly professor snape dear said mr weasley reprovingly now come on quickly he say he can not stay long what is he want with you said ron looking unnerved a mr weasley withdrew from the room you have not done anything have you no said harry indignantly racking his brain to think what he could have done that would make snape pursue him to grimmauld place had his last piece of homework perhaps earned a t he pushed open the kitchen door a minute or two later to find sirius and snape both seated at the long kitchen table glaring in opposite direction the silence between them wa heavy with mutual dislike a letter lay open on the table in front of sirius er said harry to announce his presence snape looked around at him his face framed between curtain of greasy black hair sit down potter you know said sirius loudly leaning back on his rear chair leg and speaking to the ceiling i think id page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling prefer it if you did not give order here snape it my house you see an ugly flush suffused snape s pallid face harry sat down in a chair beside sirius facing snape across the table i wa supposed to see you alone potter said snape the familiar sneer curling his mouth but black i am his godfather said sirius louder than ever i am here on dumbledores order said snape whose voice by contrast wa becoming more and more quietly waspish but by all mean stay black i know you like to feel involved what is that supposed to mean said sirius letting his chair fall back onto all four leg with a loud bang merely that i am sure you must feel ah frustrated by the fact that you can do nothing useful snape laid a delicate stress on the word for the order it wa sirius turn to flush snape s lip curled in triumph a he turned to harry the headmaster ha sent me to tell you potter that it is his wish for you to study occlumency this term study what said harry blankly snapes sneer became more pronounced occlumency potter the magical defense of the mind against external penetration an obscure branch of magic but a highly useful one page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harrys heart began to pump very fast indeed defense against external penetration but he wa not being possessed they had all agreed on that why do i have to study occlu thing he blurted out because the headmaster think it a good idea said snape smoothly you will receive private lesson once a week but you will not tell anybody what you are doing least of all dolores umbridge you understand yes said harry who is going to be teaching me snape raised an eyebrow i am he said harry had the horrible sensation that his inside were melting extra lesson with snape what on earth had he done to deserve this he looked quickly around at sirius for support why can not dumbledore teach harry asked sirius aggressively why you i suppose because it is a headmaster privilege to delegate le enjoyable task said snape silkily i assure you i did not beg for the job he got to his foot i will expect you at six of the clock on monday evening potter my office if anybody asks you are taking remedial potion nobody who ha seen you in my class could deny you need them he turned to leave his black traveling cloak billowing behind him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wait a moment said sirius sitting up straighter in his chair snape turned back to face them sneering i am in rather a hurry black unlike you i do not have unlimited leisure time ill get to the point then said sirius standing up he wa rather taller than snape who harry noticed had balled his fist in the pocket of his cloak over what harry wa sure wa the handle of his wand if i hear you are using these occlumency lesson to give harry a hard time you will have me to answer to how touching snape sneered but surely you have noticed that potter is very like his father yes i have said sirius proudly well then you will know he so arrogant that criticism simply bounce off him snape said sleekly sirius pushed his chair roughly aside and strode around the table toward snape pulling out his wand a he went snape whipped out his own they were squaring up to each other sirius looking livid snape calculating his eye darting from sirius wand tip to his face sirius said harry loudly but sirius appeared not to hear him i have warned you snivellus said sirius his face barely a foot from snape s i do not care if dumbledore think you have reformed i know better oh but why do not you tell him so whispered snape or are you afraid he might not take the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling advice of a man who ha been hiding inside his mother house for six month very seriously tell me how is lucius malfoy these day i expect he delighted his lapdog working at hogwarts is not he speaking of dog said snape softly did you know that lucius malfoy recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside clever idea black getting yourself seen on a safe station platform gave you a castiron excuse not to leave your hidey hole in future did not it sirius raised his wand no harry yelled vaulting over the table and trying to get in between them sirius do not are you calling me a coward roared sirius trying to push harry out of the way but harry would not budge why yes i suppose i am said snape harry get out of it snarled sirius pushing him out of the way with his free hand the kitchen door opened and the entire weasley family plus hermione came inside all looking very happy with mr weasley walking proudly in their midst dressed in a pair of striped pajama covered by a mackintosh cured he announced brightly to the kitchen at large completely cured he and all the other weasleys froze on the threshold gazing at the scene in front of them which wa also page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling suspended in midaction both sirius and snape looking toward the door with their wand pointing into each others face and harry immobile between them a hand stretched out to each of them trying to force them apart merlin beard said mr weasley the smile sliding off his face what is going on here both sirius and snape lowered their wand harry looked from one to the other each wore an expression of utmost contempt yet the unexpected entrance of so many witness seemed to have brought them to their sens snape pocketed his wand and swept back across the kitchen passing the weasleys without comment at the door he looked back six of the clock monday evening potter he wa gone sirius glared after him his wand at his side but what is been going on asked mr weasley again nothing arthur said sirius who wa breathing heavily a though he had just run a long distance just a friendly little chat between two old school friend with what looked like an enormous effort he smiled so you are cured that is great news really great yes is not it said mr weasley leading her husband forward into a chair healer smethwyck worked his magic in the end found an antidote to whatever that snake got in it fang and arthur learned his lesson about dabbling in muggle medicine have not you dear she added rather menacingly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes molly dear said mr weasley meekly that night meal should have been a cheerful one with mr weasley back amongst them harry could tell sirius wa trying to make it so yet when his godfather wa not forcing himself to laugh loudly at fred and george joke or offering everyone more food his face fell back into a moody brooding expression harry wa separated from him by mundungus and madeye who had dropped in to offer mr weasley their congratulation he wanted to talk to sirius to tell him that he should not listen to a word snape said that snape wa goading him deliberately and that the rest of them did not think sirius wa a coward for doing a dumbledore told him and remaining in grimmauld place but he had no opportunity to do so and wondered occasionally eyeing the ugly look on sirius face whether he would have dared to even if he had the chance instead he told ron and hermione under his voice about having to take occlumency lesson with snape dumbledore want to stop you having those dream about voldemort said hermione at once well you will not be sorry not to have them anymore will you extra lesson with snape said ron sounding aghast id rather have the nightmare they were to return to hogwarts on the knight bus the following day escorted once again by tonks and lupin both of whom were eating breakfast in the kitchen when harry ron and hermione arrived there next morning the adult seemed to have been midway through a whispered conversation when the door opened all of them looked around hastily and fell silent page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling after a hurried breakfast they pulled on jacket and scarf against the chilly gray january morning harry had an unpleasant constricted sensation in his chest he did not want to say goodbye to sirius he had a bad feeling about this parting he did not know when they would next see each other and felt that it wa incumbent upon him to say something to sirius to stop him doing anything stupid harry wa worried that snapes accusation of cowardice had stung sirius so badly he might even now be planning some foolhardy trip beyond grimmauld place before he could think of what to say however sirius had beckoned him to his side i want you to take this he said quietly thrusting a badly wrapped package roughly the size of a paperback book into harrys hand what is it harry asked a way of letting me know if snapes giving you a hard time no do not open it in here said sirius with a wary look at mr weasley who wa trying to persuade the twin to wear handknitted mitten i doubt molly would approve but i want you to use it if you need me all right okay said harry stowing the package away in the inside pocket of his jacket but he knew he would never use whatever it wa it would not be he harry who lured sirius from his place of safety no matter how foully snape treated him in their forthcoming occlumency class let u go then said sirius clapping harry on the shoulder and smiling grimly and before harry could say anything else they were heading upstairs stopping before the heavily chained and bolted front door surrounded by weasleys page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling goodbye harry take care said mr weasley hugging him see you harry and keep an eye out for snake for me said mr weasley genially shaking his hand right yeah said harry distractedly it wa his last chance to tell sirius to be careful he turned looked into his godfather face and opened his mouth to speak but before he could do so sirius wa giving him a brief onearmed hug he said gruffly look after yourself harry and next moment harry found himself being shunted out into the icy winter air with tonks today heavily disguised a a tall tweedy woman with irongray hair chivvying him down the step the door of number twelve slammed shut behind them they followed lupin down the front step a he reached the pavement harry looked around number twelve wa shrinking rapidly a those on either side of it stretched sideways squeezing it out of sight one blink later it had gone come on the quicker we get on the bus the better said tonks and harry thought there wa nervousness in the glance she threw around the square lupin flung out his right arm bang a violently purple tripledecker bus had appeared out of thin air in front of them narrowly avoiding the nearest lamppost which jumped backward out of it way a thin pimply jugeared youth in a purple uniform leapt down onto the pavement and said welcome to the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes yes we know thank you said tonks swiftly on on get on and she shoved harry forward toward the step past the conductor who goggled at harry a he passed ere it arry if you shout his name i will curse you into oblivion muttered tonks menacingly now shunting ginny and hermione forward i have always wanted to go on this thing said ron happily joining harry on board and looking around it had been evening the last time harry had traveled by knight bus and it three deck had been full of brass bedstead now in the early morning it wa crammed with an assortment of mismatched chair grouped haphazardly around window some of these appeared to have fallen over when the bus stopped abruptly in grimmauld place a few witch and wizard were still getting to their foot grumbling and somebody is shopping bag had slid the length of the bus an unpleasant mixture of frog spawn cockroach and custard cream wa scattered all over the floor look like well have to split up said tonic briskly looking around for empty chair fred george and ginny if you just take those seat at the back remus can stay with you she harry ron and hermione proceeded up to the very top deck where there were two chair at the very front of the bus and two at the back stan shunpike the conductor followed harry and ron eagerly to the back head turned a harry passed and when he sat page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling down he saw all the face flick back to the front again a harry and ron handed stan eleven sickle each the bus set off again swaying ominously it rumbled around grimmauld square weaving on and off the pavement then with another tremendous bang they were all flung backward ron chair toppled right over and pigwidgeon who had been on his lap burst out of his cage and flew twittering wildly up to the front of the bus where he fluttered down upon hermiones shoulder instead harry who had narrowly avoided falling by seizing a candle bracket looked out of the window they were now speeding down what appeared to be a motorway just outside birmingham said stan happily answering harrys unasked question a ron struggled up from the floor you keepin well then arry i seen your name in the paper load over the summer but it were not never nuffink very nice i said to ern i said e did not seem like a nutter when we met i am just go to show dunnit he handed over their ticket and continued to gaze enthralled at harry apparently stan did not care how nutty somebody wa if they were famous enough to be in the paper the knight bus swayed alarmingly overtaking a line of car on the inside looking toward the front of the bus harry saw hermione cover her eye with her hand pigwidgeon still swaying happily on her shoulder bang chair slid backward again a the knight bus jumped from the birmingham motorway to a quiet country lane full of hairpin bend hedgerow on either side of the road were leaping out of their way a they page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling mounted the verge from here they moved to a main street in the middle of a busy town then to a viaduct surrounded by tall hill then to a windswept road between highrise flat each time with a loud bang i have changed my mind muttered ron picking himself up from the floor for the sixth time i never want to ride on here again listen it ogwarts stop after this said stan brightly swaying toward them that bossy woman up front oo got on with you she is given u a little tip to move you up the queue were just going to let madam marsh off first though there wa more retching from downstairs followed by a horrible spattering sound she is not feeling er best a few minute later the knight bus screeched to a halt outside a small pub which squeezed itself out of the way to avoid a collision they could hear stan ushering the unfortunate madam marsh out of the bus and the relieved murmuring of her fellow passenger on the second deck the bus moved on again gathering speed until bang they were rolling through a snowy hogsmeade harry caught a glimpse of the hog head down it side street the severed boar head sign creaking in the wintry wind fleck of snow hit the large window at the front of the bus at last they rolled to a halt outside the gate to hogwarts lupin and tonks helped them off the bus with their luggage and then got off to say goodbye harry glanced up at the three deck of the knight bus and saw all the passenger staring down at them nose flat against the window page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you will be safe once you are in the ground said tonks casting a careful eye around at the deserted road have a good term okay look after yourselves said lupin shaking hand all round and reaching harry last and listen he lowered his voice while the rest of them exchanged lastminute goodbye with tonks harry i know you do not like snape but he is a superb occlumens and we all sirius included want you to learn to protect yourself so work hard all right yeah all right said harry heavily looking up into lupin prematurely lined face see you then the six of them struggled up the slippery drive toward the castle dragging their trunk hermione wa already talking about knitting a few elf hat before bedtime harry glanced back when they reached the oak front door the knight bus had already gone and he halfwished given what wa coming the following day that he wa still on board harry spent most of the next day dreading the evening his morning potion lesson did nothing to dispel his trepidation a snape wa a unpleasant a ever and harrys mood wa further lowered by the fact that member of the da were continually approaching him in the corridor between class asking hopefully whether there would be a meeting that night ill let you know when the next one is harry said over and over again but i can not do it tonight i have got to go to er remedial potion you take remedial potion asked zacharias smith superciliously having cornered harry in the entrance page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hall after lunch good lord you must be terrible snape doe not usually give extra lesson doe he a smith strode away in an annoyingly buoyant fashion ron glared after him shall i jinx him i can still get him from here he said raising his wand and taking aim between smith shoulder blade forget it said harry dismally it what everyone is going to think is not it that i am really stup hi harry said a voice behind him he turned around and found cho standing there oh said harry a his stomach leapt uncomfortably hi well be in the library harry said hermione firmly and she seized ron above the elbow and dragged him off toward the marble staircase had a good christmas asked cho yeah not bad said harry mine wa pretty quiet said cho for some reason she wa looking rather embarrassed erm there is another hogsmeade trip next month did you see the notice what oh no i have not checked the notice board since i got back yes it on valentine day right said harry wondering why she wa telling him this well i suppose you want to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling only if you do she said eagerly harry stared he had been about to say i suppose you want to know when the next da meeting is but her response did not seem to fit i er he said oh it okay if you do not she said looking mortified do not worry iill see you around she walked away harry stood staring after her his brain working frantically then something clunked into place cho hey cho he ran after her catching her halfway up the marble staircase er dyou want to come into hogsmeade with me on valentine day oooh yes she said blushing crimson and beaming at him right well that is settled then said harry and feeling that the day wa not going to be a complete loss after all he headed off to the library to pick up ron and hermione before their afternoon lesson walking in a rather bouncy way himself by six of the clock that evening however even the glow of having successfully asked out cho chang wa insufficient to lighten the ominous feeling that intensified with every step harry took toward snapes office page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he paused outside the door when he reached it wishing he were almost anywhere else then taking a deep breath knocked and entered it wa a shadowy room lined with shelf bearing hundred of glass jar in which floated slimy bit of animal and plant suspended in variously colored potion in a corner stood the cupboard full of ingredient that snape had once accused harry not without reason of robbing harrys attention wa drawn toward the desk however where a shallow stone basin engraved with rune and symbol lay in a pool of candlelight harry recognized it at once dumbledores pensieve wondering what on earth it wa doing here he jumped when snapes cold voice came out of the corner shut the door behind you potter harry did a he wa told with the horrible feeling that he wa imprisoning himself a he did so when he turned back to face the room snape had moved into the light and wa pointing silently at the chair opposite his desk harry sat down and so did snape his cold black eye fixed unblinkingly upon harry dislike etched in every line of his face well potter you know why you are here he said the headmaster ha asked me to teach you occlumency i can only hope that you prove more adept at it than potion right said harry tersely this may not be an ordinary class potter said snape his eye narrowed malevolently but i am still your teacher and you will therefore call me sir or professor at all time page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes sir said harry now occlumency a i told you back in your dear godfather kitchen this branch of magic seal the mind against magical intrusion and influence and why doe professor dumbledore think i need it sir said harry looking directly into snapes dark cold eye and wondering whether he would answer snape looked back at him for a moment and then said contemptuously surely even you could have worked that out by now potter the dark lord is highly skilled at legilimency what is that sir it is the ability to extract feeling and memory from another person mind he can read mind said harry quickly his worst fear confirmed you have no subtlety potter said snape his dark eye glittering you do not understand fine distinction it is one of the shortcoming that make you such a lamentable potionmaker snape paused for a moment apparently to savor the pleasure of insulting harry before continuing only muggles talk of mind reading the mind is not a book to be opened at will and examined at leisure thought are not etched on the inside of skull to be perused by any invader the mind is a complex and manylayered thing potter or at least most mind are he smirked it is true however that those who have mastered legilimency are able under certain condition to delve into the mind of their victim and to interpret their finding correctly the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dark lord for instance almost always know when somebody is lying to him only those skilled at occlumency are able to shut down those feeling and memory that contradict the lie and so utter falsehood in his presence without detection whatever snape said legilimency sounded like mind reading to harry and he did not like the sound of it at all so he could know what were thinking right now sir the dark lord is at a considerable distance and the wall and ground of hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spell and charm to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them said snape time and space matter in magic potter eye contact is often essential to legilimency well then why do i have to learn occlumency snape eyed harry tracing his mouth with one long thin finger a he did so the usual rule do not seem to apply with you potter the curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the dark lord the evidence suggests that at time when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable when you are asleep for instance you are sharing the dark lord thought and emotion the headmaster think it inadvisable for this to continue he wish me to teach you how to close your mind to the dark lord harrys heart wa pumping fast again none of this added up page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but why doe professor dumbledore want to stop it he asked abruptly i do not like it much but it been useful ha not it i mean i saw that snake attack mr weasley and if i had not professor dumbledore would not have been able to save him would he sir snape stared at harry for a few moment still tracing his mouth with his finger when he spoke again it wa slowly and deliberately a though he weighed every word it appears that the dark lord ha been unaware of the connection between you and himself until very recently up till now it seems that you have been experiencing his emotion and sharing his thought without his being any the wiser however the vision you had shortly before christmas the one with the snake and mr weasley do not interrupt me potter said snape in a dangerous voice a i wa saying the vision you had shortly before christmas represented such a powerful incursion upon the dark lord thought i saw inside the snake head not his i thought i just told you not to interrupt me potter but harry did not care if snape wa angry at last he seemed to be getting to the bottom of this business he had moved forward in his chair so that without realizing it he wa perched on the very edge tense a though poised for flight how come i saw through the snake eye if it voldemorts thought i am sharing do not say the dark lord name spat snape page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there wa a nasty silence they glared at each other across the pensieve professor dumbledore say his name said harry quietly dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard snape muttered while he may feel secure enough to use the name the rest of u he rubbed his left forearm apparently unconsciously on the spot where harry knew the dark mark wa burned into his skin i just wanted to know harry began again forcing his voice back to politeness why you seem to have visited the snake mind because that wa where the dark lord wa at that particular moment snarled snape he wa possessing the snake at the time and so you dreamed you were inside it too and vol he realized i wa there it seems so said snape coolly how do you know said harry urgently is this just professor dumbledore guessing or i told you said snape rigid in his chair his eye slit to call me sir yes sir said harry impatiently but how do you know it is enough that we know said snape repressively the important point is that the dark lord is now aware that you are gaining access to his thought and feeling he ha also deduced that the process is likely to work in reverse that is to say he ha page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling realized that he might be able to access your thought and feeling in return and he might try and make me do thing asked harry sir he added hurriedly he might said snape sounding cold and unconcerned which brings u back to occlumency snape pulled out his wand from an inside pocket of his robe and harry tensed in his chair but snape merely raised the wand to his temple and placed it tip into the greasy root of his hair when he withdrew it some silvery substance came away stretching from temple to wand like a thick gossamer strand which broke a he pulled the wand away from it and fell gracefully into the pensieve where it swirled silvery white neither gas nor liquid twice more snape raised the wand to his temple and deposited the silvery substance into the stone basin then without offering any explanation of his behavior he picked up the pensieve carefully removed it to a shelf out of their way and returned to face harry with his wand held at the ready stand up and take out your wand potter harry got to his foot feeling nervous they faced each other with the desk between them you may use your wand to attempt to disarm me or defend yourself in any other way you can think of said snape and what are you going to do harry asked eyeing snape s wand apprehensively i am about to attempt to break into your mind said snape softly we are going to see how well you resist page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the imperius curse you will find that similar power are needed for this brace yourself now legilimensv snape had struck before harry wa ready before harry had even begun to summon any force of resistance the office swam in front of his eye and vanished image after image wa racing through his mind like a flickering film so vivid it blinded him to his surroundings he wa five watching dudley riding a new red bicycle and his heart wa bursting with jealousy he wa nine and ripper the bulldog wa chasing him up a tree and the dursleys were laughing below on the lawn he wa sitting under the sorting hat and it wa telling him he would do well in slytherin hermione wa lying in the hospital wing her face covered with thick black hair a hundred dementors were closing in on him beside the dark lake cho chang wa drawing nearer to him under the mistletoe no said a voice in harrys head a the memory of cho drew nearer you are not watching that you are not watching it it private he felt a sharp pain in his knee snape s office had come back into view and he realized that he had fallen to the floor one of his knee had collided painfully with the leg of snape s desk he looked up at snape who had lowered his wand and wa rubbing his wrist there wa an angry weal there like a scorch mark did you mean to produce a stinging hex asked snape coolly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no said harry bitterly getting up from the floor i thought not said snape contemptuously you let me get in too far you lost control did you see everything i saw harry asked unsure whether he wanted to hear the answer flash of it said snape his lip curling to whom did the dog belong my aunt marge harry muttered hating snape well for a first attempt that wa not a poor a it might have been said snape raising his wand once more you managed to stop me eventually though you wasted time and energy shouting you must remain focused repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand i am trying said harry angrily but you are not telling me how manner potter said snape dangerously now i want you to close your eye harry threw him a filthy look before doing a he wa told he did not like the idea of standing there with his eye shut while snape faced him carrying a wand clear your mind potter said snape s cold voice let go of all emotion but harrys anger at snape continued to pound through his vein like venom let go of his anger he could a easily detach his leg page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you are not doing it potter you will need more discipline than this focus now harry tried to empty his mind tried not to think or remember or feel let u go again on the count of three one two three legilimensl a great black dragon wa rearing in front of him his father and mother were waving at him out of an enchanted mirror cedric diggory wa lying on the ground with blank eye staring at him nooooooo he wa on his knee again his face buried in his hand his brain aching a though someone had been trying to pull it from his skull get up said snape sharply get up you are not trying you are making no effort you are allowing me access to memory you fear handing me weapon harry stood up again his heart thumping wildly a though he had really just seen cedric dead in the graveyard snape looked paler than usual and angrier though not nearly a angry a harry wa i am making an effort he said through clenched teeth i told you to empty yourself of emotion yeah well i am finding that hard at the moment harry snarled then you will find yourself easy prey for the dark lord said snape savagely fool who wear their page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling heart proudly on their sleeve who can not control their emotion who wallow in sad memory and allow themselves to be provoked this easily weak people in other word they stand no chance against his power he will penetrate your mind with absurd ease potter i am not weak said harry in a low voice fury now pumping through him so that he thought he might attack snape in a moment then prove it master yourself spat snape control your anger discipline your mind we shall try again get ready now legilimens he wa watching uncle vernon hammering the letter box shut a hundred dementors were drifting across the lake in the ground toward him he wa running along a windowless passage with mr weasley they were drawing nearer to the plain black door at the end of the corridor harry expected to go through it but mr weasley led him off to the left down a flight of stone step i know i know he wa on all four again on snapes office floor his scar wa prickling unpleasantly but the voice that had just issued from his mouth wa triumphant he pushed himself up again to find snape staring at him his wand raised it looked a though this time snape had lifted the spell before harry had even tried to fight back what happened then potter he asked eyeing harry intently i saw i remembered harry panted i have just realized page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling realized what asked snape sharply harry did not answer at once he wa still savoring the moment of blinding realization a he rubbed his forehead he had been dreaming about a windowless corridor ending in a locked door for month without once realizing that it wa a real place now seeing the memory again he knew that all along he had been dreaming about the corridor down which he had run with mr weasley on the twelfth of august a they hurried to the courtroom in the ministry it wa the corridor leading to the department of mystery and mr weasley had been there the night that he had been attacked by voldemorts snake he looked up at snape what is in the department of mystery what did you say snape asked quietly and harry saw with deep satisfaction that snape wa unnerved i said what is in the department of mystery sir harry said and why said snape slowly would you ask such a thing because said harry watching snape closely for a reaction that corridor i have just seen i have been dreaming about it for month i have just recognized it it lead to the department of mystery and i think voldemort want something from i have told you not to say the dark lord name page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they glared at each other harrys scar seared again but he did not care snape looked agitated when he spoke again he sounded a though he wa trying to appear cool and unconcerned there are many thing in the department of mystery potter few of which you would understand and none of which concern you do i make myself plain yes harry said still rubbing his prickling scar which wa becoming more painful i want you back here same time on wednesday and we will continue work then fine said harry he wa desperate to get out of snape s office and find ron and hermione you are to rid your mind of all emotion every night before sleep empty it make it blank and calm you understand yes said harry who wa barely listening and be warned potter i shall know if you have not practiced right harry mumbled he picked up his schoolbag swung it over his shoulder and hurried toward the office door a he opened it he glanced back at snape who had his back to harry and wa scooping his own thought out of the pensieve with the tip of his wand and replacing them carefully inside his own head harry left without another word closing the door carefully behind him his scar still throbbing painfully page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry found ron and hermione in the library where they were working on umbridges most recent ream of homework other student nearly all of them fifth year sat at lamplit table nearby nose close to book quill scratching feverishly while the sky outside the mullioned window grew steadily blacker the only other sound wa the slight squeaking of one of madam pinces shoe a the librarian prowled the aisle menacingly breathing down the neck of those touching her precious book harry felt shivery his scar wa still aching he felt almost feverish when he sat down opposite ron and hermione he caught sight of himself in the window opposite he wa very white and his scar seemed to be showing up more clearly than usual how did it go hermione whispered and then looking concerned are you all right harry yeah fine i do not know said harry impatiently wincing a pain shot through his scar again listen i have just realized something and he told them what he had just seen and deduced so so are you saying whispered ron a madam pince swept past squeaking slightly that the weapon the thing youknow who is after is in the ministry of magic in the department of mystery it got to be harry whispered i saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtroom for my hearing and it definitely the same one he wa guarding when the snake bit him hermione let out a long slow sigh of course she breathed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling of course what said ron rather impatiently ron think about it sturgis podmore wa trying to get through a door at the ministry of magic it must have been that one it too much of a coincidence how come sturgis wa trying to break in when he on our side said ron well i do not know hermione admitted that is a bit odd so what is in the department of mystery harry asked ron ha your dad ever mentioned anything about it i know they call the people who work in there unspeakables said ron frowning because no one really seems to know what they do in there weird place to have a weapon it not weird at all it make perfect sense said hermione it will be something top secret that the ministry ha been developing i expect harry are you sure you are all right for harry had just run both his hand hard over his forehead a though trying to iron it yeah fine he said lowering his hand which were trembling i just feel a bit i do not like occlumency much i expect anyone would feel shaky if they would had their mind attacked over and over again said hermione sympathetically look let u get back to the common room well be a bit more comfortable there page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but the common room wa packed and full of shriek of laughter and excitement fred and george were demonstrating their latest bit of joke shop merchandise headless hat shouted george a fred waved a pointed hat decorated with a fluffy pink feather at the watching student two galleon each watch fred now fred swept the hat onto his head beaming for a second he merely looked rather stupid then both hat and head vanished several girl screamed but everyone else wa roaring with laughter and off again shouted george and freds hand groped for a moment in what seemed to be thin air over his shoulder then his head reappeared a he swept the pinkfeathered hat from it again how do those hat work then said hermione distracted from her homework and watching fred and george i mean obviously it some kind of invisibility spell but it rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundary of the charmed object id imagine the charm would not have a very long life though harry did not answer he wa still feeling ill i am going to have to do this tomorrow he muttered pushing the book he had just taken out of his bag back inside it well write it in your homework planner then said hermione encouragingly so you do not forget page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry and ron exchanged look a he reached into his bag withdrew the planner and opened it tentatively do not leave it till later you big secondrateri chided the book a harry scribbled down umbridges homework hermione beamed at it i think go to bed said harry stuffing the homework planner back into his bag and making a mental note to drop it in the fire the first opportunity he got he walked across the common room dodging george who tried to put a headless hat on him and reached the peace and cool of the stone staircase to the boy dormitory he wa feeling sick again just a he had the night he had had the vision of the snake but thought that if he could just lie down for a while he would be all right he opened the door of his dormitory and wa one step inside it when he experienced pain so severe he thought that someone must have sliced into the top of his head he did not know where he wa whether he wa standing or lying down he did not even know his own name maniacal laughter wa ringing in his ear he wa happier than he had been in a very long time jubilant ecstatic triumphant a wonderful wonderful thing had happened harry harry someone had hit him around the face the insane laughter wa punctuated with a cry of pain the happiness wa draining out of him but the laughter continued page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he opened his eye and a he did so he became aware that the wild laughter wa coming out of his own mouth the moment he realized this it died away harry lay panting on the floor staring up at the ceiling the scar on his forehead throbbing horribly ron wa bending over him looking very worried what happened he said i do not know harry gasped sitting up again he really happy really happy youknowwho is something good happened mumbled harry he wa shaking a badly a he had done after seeing the snake attack mr weasley and felt very sick something he been hoping for the word came just a they had back in the gryffindor changing room a though a stranger wa speaking them through harrys mouth yet he knew they were true he took deep breath willing himself not to vomit all over ron he wa very glad that dean and seamus were not here to watch this time hermione told me to come and check on you said ron in a low voice helping harry to his foot she say your defense will be low at the moment after snapes been fiddling around with your mind still i suppose it will help in the long run will not it he looked doubtfully at harry a he helped him toward bed harry nodded without any conviction and slumped back on his pillow aching all over from having fallen to the floor so often that evening his scar still prickling painfully he could not help feeling that his first foray into occlumency had weakened his mind resistance rather than strengthening it and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he wondered with a feeling of great trepidation what had happened to make lord voldemort the happiest he had been in fourteen year page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the beetle at bay harrys question wa answered the very next morning when hermiones daily prophet arrived she smoothed it out gazed for a moment at the front page and then gave a yelp that caused everyone in the vicinity to stare at her what said harry and ron together for an answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten blackandwhite photograph that filled the whole of the front page nine showing wizard face and the tenth a witch some of the people in the photograph were silently jeering others were tapping their finger on the frame of their picture looking insolent each picture wa captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to azkaban antonin dolohov read the legend beneath a wizard with a long pale twisted face who wa sneering up at harry convicted of the brutal murder of gideon and fabian prewett page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling augustus rookwood said the caption beneath a pockmarked man with greasy hair who wa leaning against the edge of his picture looking bored convicted of leaking ministry of magic secret to he whomustnotbenamed but harrys eye were drawn to the picture of the witch her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page she had long dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture though he had seen it sleek thick and shining she glared up at him through heavily lidded eye an arrogant disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth like sirius she retained vestige of great good look but something perhaps azkaban had taken most of her beauty bellatrix lestrange convicted of the torture and permanent incapacitation of frank and alice longbottom hermione nudged harry and pointed at the headline over the picture which harry concentrating on bellatrix had not yet read mass breakout from azkaban ministry fear black is rallying point for old death eater black said harry loudly not shhh whispered hermione desperately not so loud just read it the ministry of magic announced late last night that there ha been a mass breakout from azkaban page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling speaking to reporter in his private office cornelius fudge minister of magic confirmed that ten high security prisoner escaped in the early hour of yesterday evening and that he ha already informed the muggle prime minister of the dangerous nature of these individual we find ourselves most unfortunately in the same position we were two and a half year ago when the murderer sirius black escaped said fudge last night nor do we think the two breakout are unrelated an escape of this magnitude suggests outside help and we must remember that black a the first person ever to break out of azkaban would be ideally placed to help others follow in his footstep we think it likely that these individual who include black cousin bellatrix lestrange have rallied around black a their leader we are however doing all we can to round up the criminal and beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious on no account should any of these individual be approached there you are harry said ron looking awestruck that is why he wa happy last night i do not believe this snarled harry fudge is blaming the breakout on sirius what other option doe he have said hermione bitterly he can hardly say sorry everyone dumbledore warned me this might happen the azkaban guard have joined lord voldemort stop whimpering ron and now voldemorts worst supporter have broken out too i mean he spent a good six month telling everyone you and dumbledore are liar ha not he hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while harry looked around the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling great hall he could not understand why his fellow student were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page but very few of them took the newspaper every day like hermione there they all were talking about homework and quidditch and who knew what other rubbish and outside these wall ten more death eater had swollen voldemorts rank he glanced up at the staff table it wa a different story here dumbledore and professor mcgonagall were deep in conversation both looking extremely grave professor sprout had the prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and wa reading the front page with such concentration that she wa not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon meanwhile at the far end of the table professor umbridge wa tucking into a bowl of porridge for once her pouchy toad eye were not sweeping the great hall looking for misbehaving student she scowled a she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where dumbledore and mcgonagall were talking so intently oh my said hermione wonderingly still staring at the newspaper what now said harry quickly he wa feeling jumpy it horrible said hermione looking shaken she folded back page ten of the newspaper and handed it back to harry and ron tragic demise of ministry of magic worker page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling st mungos hospital promised a full inquiry last night after ministry of magic worker broderick bode wa discovered dead in his bed strangled by a pottedplant healer called to the scene were unable to revive mr bode who had been injured in a workplace accident some week prior to his death healer miriam strout who wa in charge of mr bodes ward at the time of the incident ha been suspended on full pay and wa unavailable for comment yesterday but a spokeswizard for the hospital said in a statement st mungos deeply regret the death of mr bode whose health wa improving steadily prior to this tragic accident we have strict guideline on the decoration permitted on our ward but it appears that healer strout busy over the christmas period overlooked the danger of the plant on mr bodes bedside table a his speech and mobility improved healer strout encouraged mr bode to look after the plant himself unaware that it wa not an innocent flitterbloom but a cutting of devil snare which when touched by the convalescent mr bode throttled him instantly st mungos is a yet unable to account for the presence of the plant on the ward and asks any witch or wizard with information to come forward bode said ron bode it ring a bell we saw him hermione whispered in st mungos remember he wa in the bed opposite lockharts just lying there staring at the ceiling and we saw the devil snare arrive she the healer said it wa a christmas present harry looked back at the story a feeling of horror wa rising like bile in his throat page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling how come we did not recognize devil snare we have seen it before we could have stopped this from happening who expects devil snare to turn up in a hospital disguised a a potted plant said ron sharply it not our fault whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame they must be a real prat why did not they check what they were buying oh come on ron said hermione shakily i do not think anyone could put devil snare in a pot and not realize it try to kill whoever touch it this this wa murder a clever murder a well if the plant wa sent anonymously how is anyone ever going to find out who did it harry wa not thinking about devil snare he wa remembering taking the lift down to the ninth level of the ministry on the day of his hearing and the sallowfaced man who had got in on the atrium level i met bode he said slowly i saw him at the ministry with your dad ron mouth fell open i have heard dad talk about him at home he wa an unspeakable he worked in the department of mystery they looked at one another for a moment then hermione pulled the newspaper back toward her closed it glared for a moment at the picture of the ten escaped death eater on the front then leapt to her foot where are you going said ron startled page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling to send a letter said hermione swinging her bag onto her shoulder it well i do not know whether but it worth trying and i am the only one who can i hate it when she doe that grumbled ron a he and harry got up from the table and made their own slower way out of the great hall would it kill her to tell u what she is up to for once it would take her about ten more second hey hagrid hagrid wa standing beside the door into the entrance hall waiting for a crowd of ravenclaws to pas he wa still a heavily bruised a he had been on the day he had come back from his mission to the giant and there wa a new cut right across the bridge of his nose all righ you two he said trying to muster a smile but managing only a kind of pained grimace are you okay hagrid asked harry following him a he lumbered after the ravenclaws fine fine said hagrid with a feeble assumption of airiness he waved a hand and narrowly missed concussing a frightenedlooking professor vector who wa passing jus busy yeh know usual stuff lesson ter prepare couple o salamander got scale rot an i am on probation he mumbled you are on probation said ron very loudly so that many student passing looked around curiously sorry i mean you are on probation he whispered yeah said hagrid sno moren i expected ter tell yeh the truth yeh migh notve picked up on it bu that inspection didn go too well yeh know page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling anyway he sighed deeply be go an mb a bit more chili powder on them salamander or their tailsll be hangin off them next see yeh harry ron he trudged away out the front door and down the stone step into the damp ground harry watched him go wondering how much more bad news he could stand the fact that hagrid wa now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few day but to harrys indignation hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it indeed some people draco malfoy prominent among them seemed positively gleeful a for the freakish death of an obscure department of mystery employee in st mungos harry ron and hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared there wa only one topic of conversation in the corridor now the ten escaped death eater whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspaper rumor were flying that some of the convict had been spotted in hogsmeade that they were supposed to be hiding out in the shrieking shack and that they were going to break into hogwarts just a sirius black had done those who came from wizarding family had grown up hearing the name of these death eater spoken with almost a much fear a voldemorts the crime they had committed during the day of voldemorts reign of terror were legendary there were relative of their victim among the hogwarts student who now found themselves the unwilling object of a gruesome sort of reflected fame a they walked the corridor susan bone who had an uncle aunt and cousin who had all died at the hand of one of the ten said miserably during herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and i do not know how you stand it it horrible she said bluntly dumping far too much dragon manure on her tray of screechsnap seedling causing them to wriggle and squeak in discomfort it wa true that harry wa the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridor these day yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperer voice they sounded curious rather than hostile now and once or twice he wa sure he overheard snatch of conversation that suggested that the speaker were not satisfied with the prophet version of how and why ten death eater had managed to break out of azkaban fortress in their confusion and fear these doubter now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them the one that harry and dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year it wa not only the student mood that had changed it wa now quite common to come across two or three teacher conversing in low urgent whisper in the corridor breaking off their conversation the moment they saw student approaching they obviously can not talk freely in the staffroom anymore said hermione in a low voice a she harry and ron passed professor mcgonagall flitwick and sprout huddled together outside the charm classroom one day not with umbridge there reckon they know anything new said ron gazing back over his shoulder at the three teacher if they do were not going to hear about it are we said harry angrily not after decree what number are we on now page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling for new sign had appeared on the house notice board the morning after news of the azkaban breakout by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts teacher are hereby banned from giving student any information that is not strictly related to the subject they are paid to teach the above is in accordance with educational decree number twentysix signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor this latest decree had been the subject of a great number of joke among the student lee jordan had pointed out to umbridge that by the term of the new rule she wa not allowed to tell fred and george off for playing exploding snap in the back of the class exploding snap got nothing to do with defense against the dark art professor that is not information relating to your subject when harry next saw lee the back of his hand wa bleeding rather badly harry recommended essence of murtlap harry had thought that the breakout from azkaban might have humbled umbridge a little that she might page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling have been abashed at the catastrophe that had occurred right under her beloved fudge nose it seemed however to have only intensified her furious desire to bring every aspect of life at hogwarts under her personal control she seemed determined at the very least to achieve a sacking before long and the only question wa whether it would be professor trelawney or hagrid who went first every single divination and care of magical creature lesson wa now conducted in the presence of umbridge and her clipboard she lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room interrupting professor trelawneys increasingly hysterical talk with difficult question about ornithomancy and heptomology insisting that she predict student answer before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball the tea leaf and the rune stone in turn harry thought that professor trelawney might soon crack under the strain several time he passed her in the corridor in itself a very unusual occurrence a she generally remained in her tower room muttering wildly to herself wringing her hand and shooting terrified glance over her shoulder all the time giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry if he had not been so worried about hagrid he would have felt sorry for her but if one of them wa to be ousted out of a job there could be only one choice for harry a to who should remain unfortunately harry could not see that hagrid wa putting up a better show than trelawney though he seemed to be following hermiones advice and had shown them nothing more frightening than a crup a creature indistinguishable from a jack russell terrier except for it forked tail since before christmas he also seemed to have lost his nerve he wa oddly distracted and jumpy in lesson losing the thread of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what he wa saying while talking to the class answering question wrongly and glancing anxiously at umbridge all the time he wa also more distant with harry ron and hermione than he had ever been before expressly forbidding them to visit him after dark if she catch yeh it will be all of our neck on the line he told them flatly and with no desire to do anything that jeopardized his job further they abstained from walking down to his hut in the evening it seemed to harry that umbridge wa steadily depriving him of everything that made his life at hogwarts worth living visit to hagrids house letter from sirius his firebolt and quidditch he took his revenge the only way he had redoubling his effort for the da harry wa pleased to see that all of them even zacharias smith had been spurred to work harder than ever by the news that ten more death eater were now on the loose but in nobody wa this improvement more pronounced than in neville the news of his parent attacker escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him he had not once mentioned his meeting with harry ron and hermione on the closed ward in st mungos and taking their lead from him they had kept quiet about it too nor had he said anything on the subject of bellatrix and her fellow torturer escape in fact he barely spoke during da meeting anymore but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and countercurse harry taught them his plump face screwed up in concentration apparently indifferent to injury or accident working harder than anyone else in the room he wa improving so fast it wa quite unnerving and when harry taught them the shield charm a mean of deflecting minor jinx so page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling that they rebounded upon the attacker only hermione mastered the charm faster than neville in fact harry would have given a great deal to be making a much progress at occlumency a neville wa making during da meeting harrys session with snape which had started badly enough were not improving on the contrary harry felt he wa getting worse with every lesson before he had started studying occlumency his scar had prickled occasionally usually during the night or else following one of those strange flash of voldemorts thought or mood that he experienced every now and then nowadays however his scar hardly ever stopped prickling and he often felt lurch of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what wa happening to him at the time which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar he had the horrible impression that he wa slowly turning into a kind of aerial that wa tuned in to tiny fluctuation in voldemorts mood and he wa sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first occlumency lesson with snape what wa more he wa now dreaming about walking down the corridor toward the entrance to the department of mystery almost every night dream that always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door maybe it a bit like an illness said hermione looking concerned when harry confided in her and ron a fever or something it ha to get worse before it get better it lesson with snape that are making it worse said harry flatly i am getting sick of my scar hurting and i am getting bored walking down that corridor every night he rubbed his forehead angrily i just page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wish the door would open i am sick of standing staring at it that is not funny said hermione sharply dumbledore doe not want you to have dream about that corridor at all or he would not have asked snape to teach you occlumency you are just going to have to work a bit harder in your lesson i am working said harry nettled you try it sometime snape trying to get inside your head it not a bundle of laugh you know maybe said ron slowly maybe what said hermione rather snappishly maybe it not harrys fault he can not close his mind said ron darkly what do you mean said hermione well maybe snape is not really trying to help harry harry and hermione stared at him ron looked darkly and meaningfully from one to the other maybe he said again in a lower voice he actually trying to open harrys mind a bit wider make it easier for youknow shut up ron said hermione angrily how many time have you suspected snape and when have you ever been right dumbledore trust him he work for the order that ought to be enough he used to be a death eater said ron stubbornly and we have never seen proof that he really swapped side page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dumbledore trust him hermione repeated and if we can not trust dumbledore we can not trust anyone with so much to worry about and so much to do startling amount of homework that frequently kept the fifth year working until past midnight secret da meeting and regular class with snape january seemed to be passing alarmingly fast before harry knew it february had arrived bringing with it wetter and warmer weather and the prospect of the second hogsmeade visit of the year harry had had very little time to spare on conversation with cho since they had agreed to visit the village together but suddenly found himself facing a valentine day spent entirely in her company on the morning of the fourteenth he dressed particularly carefully he and ron arrived at breakfast just in time for the arrival of the post owl hedwig wa not there not that he had expected her but hermione wa tugging a letter from the beak of an unfamiliar brown owl a they sat down and about time if it had not come today she said eagerly tearing open the envelope and pulling out a small piece of parchment her eye sped from left to right a she read through the message and a grimly pleased expression spread across her face listen harry she said looking up at him this is really important do you think you could meet me in the three broomstick around midday well i do not know said harry dubiously cho might be expecting me to spend the whole day with her we never said what we were going to do well bring her along if you must said hermione urgently but will you come page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well all right but why i have not got time to tell you now i have got to answer this quickly and she hurried out of the great hall the letter clutched in one hand and a piece of uneaten toast in the other are you coming harry asked ron but he shook his head looking glum i can not come into hogsmeade at all angelina want a full day training like it going to help were the worst team i have ever seen you should see sloper and kirke they are pathetic even worse than i am he heaved a great sigh i do not know why angelina will not just let me resign it because you are good when you are on form that is why said harry irritably he found it very hard to be sympathetic to ron plight when he himself would have given almost anything to be playing in the forthcoming match against hufflepuff ron seemed to notice harrys tone because he did not mention quidditch again during breakfast and there wa a slight frostiness in the way they said goodbye to each other shortly afterward ron departed for the quidditch pitch and harry after attempting to flatten his hair while staring at his reflection in the back of a teaspoon proceeded alone to the entrance hall to meet cho feeling very apprehensive and wondering what on earth they were going to talk about she wa waiting for him a little to the side of the oak front door looking very pretty with her hair tied back in a long ponytail harrys foot seemed to be too page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling big for his body a he walked toward her and he wa suddenly horribly aware of his arm and how stupid they looked swinging at his side hi said cho slightly breathlessly hi said harry they stared at each other for a moment then harry said well er shall we go then oh yes they joined the queue of people being signed out by filch occasionally catching each others eye and grinning shiftily but not talking to each other harry wa relieved when they reached the fresh air finding it easier to walk along in silence than just stand there looking awkward it wa a fresh breezy sort of day and a they passed the quidditch stadium harry glimpsed ron and ginny skimming over the stand and felt a horrible pang that he wa not up there with them you really miss it do not you said cho he looked around and saw her watching him yeah sighed harry i do remember the first time we played against each other in the third year she asked him yeah said harry grinning you kept blocking me and wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to said cho smiling reminiscently i heard he got taken on by pride of portree is that right page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling nah it wa puddlemere united i saw him at the world cup last year oh i saw you there too remember we were on the same campsite it wa really good wa not it the subject of the quidditch world cup carried them all the way down the drive and out through the gate harry could hardly believe how easy it wa to talk to her no more difficult in fact than talking to ron and hermione and he wa just starting to feel confident and cheerful when a large gang of slytherin girl passed them including pansy parkinson potter and chang screeched pansy to a chorus of snide giggle urgh chang i do not think much of your taste at least diggory wa goodlooking they sped up talking and shrieking in a pointed fashion with many exaggerated glance back at harry and cho leaving an embarrassed silence in their wake harry could think of nothing else to say about quidditch and cho slightly flushed wa watching her foot so where dyou want to go harry asked a they entered hogsmeade the high street wa full of student ambling up and down peering into the shop window and messing about together on the pavement oh i do not mind said cho shrugging um shall we just have a look in the shop or something they wandered toward dervish and banges a large poster had been stuck up in the window and a few hogsmeaders were looking at it they moved aside when harry and cho approached and harry found himself staring once more at the ten picture of the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling escaped death eater the poster by order of the ministry of magic offered a thousandgalleon reward to any witch or wizard with information relating to the recapture of any of the convict pictured it funny is not it said cho in a low voice also gazing up at the picture of the death eater remember when that sirius black escaped and there were dementors all over hogsmeade looking for him and now ten death eater are on the loose and there are not dementors anywhere yeah said harry tearing his eye away from bellatrix lestranges face to glance up and down the high street yeah it is weird he wa not sorry that there were no dementors nearby but now he came to think of it their absence wa highly significant they had not only let the death eater escape they were not bothering to look for them it looked a though they really were outside ministry control now the ten escaped death eater were staring out of every shop window he and cho passed it started to rain a they passed scrivenshafts cold heavy drop of water kept hitting harrys face and the back of his neck um dyou want to get a coffee said cho tentatively a the rain began to fall more heavily yeah all right said harry looking around where oh there is a really nice place just up here have not you ever been to madam puddifoots she said brightly and she led him up a side road and into a small tea shop that harry had never noticed before it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wa a cramped steamy little place where everything seemed to have been decorated with frill or bow harry wa reminded unpleasantly of umbridges office cute is not it said cho happily er yeah said harry untruthfully look she is decorated it for valentine day said cho indicating a number of golden cherub that were hovering over each of the small circular table occasionally throwing pink confetti over the occupant aaah they sat down at the last remaining table which wa situated in the steamy window roger davy the ravenclaw quidditch captain wa sitting about a foot and a half away with a pretty blonde girl they were holding hand the sight made harry feel uncomfortable particularly when looking around the tea shop he saw that it wa full of nothing but couple all of them holding hand perhaps cho would expect him to hold her hand what can i get you mdears said madam puddifoot a very stout woman with a shiny black bun squeezing between their table and roger davy with great difficulty two coffee please said cho in the time it took for their coffee to arrive roger davy and his girlfriend started kissing over their sugar bowl harry wished they would not he felt that davy wa setting a standard with which cho would soon expect him to compete he felt his face growing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hot and tried staring out of the window but it wa so steamed up he could not see the street outside to postpone the moment when he had to look at cho he stared up at the ceiling a though examining the paintwork and received a handful of confetti in the face from their hovering cherub after a few more painful minute cho mentioned umbridge harry seized on the subject with relief and they passed a few happy moment abusing her but the subject had already been so thoroughly canvassed during da meeting it did not last very long silence fell again harry wa very conscious of the slurping noise coming from the table next door and cast wildly around for something else to say er listen dyou want to come with me to the three broomstick at lunchtime i am meeting hermione granger there cho raised her eyebrow you are meeting hermione granger today yeah well she asked me to so i thought i would dyou want to come with me she said it would not matter if you did oh well that wa nice of her but cho did not sound a though she thought it wa nice at all on the contrary her tone wa cold and all of a sudden she looked rather forbidding a few more minute passed in total silence harry drinking his coffee so fast that he would soon need a fresh cup next door roger davy and his girlfriend seemed glued together by the lip page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling chos hand wa lying on the table beside her coffee and harry wa feeling a mounting pressure to take hold of it just do it he told himself a a fount of mingled panic and excitement surged up inside his chest just reach out and grab it amazing how much more difficult it wa to extend his arm twelve inch and touch her hand than to snatch a speeding snitch from midair but just a he moved his hand forward cho took hers off the table she wa now watching roger davy kissing his girlfriend with a mildly interested expression he asked me out you know she said in a quiet voice a couple of week ago roger i turned him down though harry who had grabbed the sugar bowl to excuse his sudden lunging movement across the table could not think why she wa telling him this if she wished she were sitting at the table next door being heartily kissed by roger davy why had she agreed to come out with him he said nothing their cherub threw another handful of confetti over them some of it landed in the last cold dreg of coffee harry had been about to drink i came in here with cedric last year said cho in the second or so it took for him to take in what she had said harrys inside had become glacial he could not believe she wanted to talk about cedric now while kissing couple surrounded them and a cherub floated over their head chos voice wa rather higher when she spoke again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i have been meaning to ask you for age did cedric did he mmmention me at all before he died this wa the very last subject on earth harry wanted to discus and least of all with cho well no he said quietly there there wa not time for him to say anything erm so dyou dyou get to see a lot of quidditch in the holiday you support the tornado right his voice sounded falsely bright and cheery to his horror he saw that her eye were swimming with tear again just a they had been after the last da meeting before christmas look he said desperately leaning in so that nobody else could overhear let u not talk about cedric right now let u talk about something else but this apparently wa quite the wrong thing to say i thought she said tear spattering down onto the table i thought you would uuunderstand i need to talk about it surely you nneed to talk about it ttoo i mean you saw it happen ddidnt you everything wa going nightmarishly wrong roger davy girlfriend had even unglued herself to look around at cho cry well i have talked about it harry said in a whisper to ron and hermione but oh you will talk to hermione granger she said shrilly her face now shining with tear and several more kissing couple broke apart to stare but you will not talk to me pperhaps it would be best if we just page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling just ppaid and you went and met up with hermione ggranger like you obviously want to harry stared at her utterly bewildered a she seized a frilly napkin and dabbed at her shining face with it cho he said weakly wishing roger would seize his girlfriend and start kissing her again to stop her goggling at him and cho go on leave she said now cry into the napkin i do not know why you asked me out in the first place if you are going to make arrangement to meet other girl right after me how many are you meeting after hermione it not like that said harry and he wa so relieved at finally understanding what she wa annoyed about that he laughed which he realized a split second too late wa a mistake cho sprang to her foot the whole tearoom wa quiet and everybody wa watching them now ill see you around harry she said dramatically and hiccuping slightly she dashed to the door wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain cho harry called after her but the door had already swung shut behind her with a tuneful tinkle there wa total silence within the tea shop every eye wa upon harry he threw a galleon down onto the table shook pink confetti out of his eye and followed cho out of the door it wa raining hard now and she wa nowhere to be seen he simply did not understand what had page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling happened half an hour ago they had been getting along fine woman he muttered angrily sloshing down the rainwashed street with his hand in his pocket what did she want to talk about cedric for anyway why doe she always want to drag up a subject that make her act like a human hosepipe he turned right and broke into a splashy run and within minute he wa turning into the doorway of the three broomstick he knew he wa too early to meet hermione but he thought it likely there would be someone in here with whom he could spend the intervening time he shook his wet hair out of his eye and looked around hagrid wa sitting alone in a corner looking morose hi hagrid he said when he had squeezed through the crammed table and pulled up a chair beside him hagrid jumped and looked down at harry a though he barely recognized him harry saw that he had two fresh cut on his face and several new bruise oh it you harry said hagrid you all righ yeah i am fine lied harry in fact next to this battered and mournfullooking hagrid he felt he did not have much to complain about er are you okay me said hagrid oh yeah i am grand harry grand he gazed into the depth of his pewter tankard which wa the size of a large bucket and sighed harry did not know what to say to him they sat side by side in page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling silence for a moment then hagrid said abruptly in the same boat you an me aren we harry er said harry yeah i have said it before both outsider like said hagrid nodding wisely an both orphan yeah both orphan he took a great swig from his tankard make a diffrence havin a decent family he said me dad wa decent an your mum an dad were decent if they would lived life would have bin diffrent eh yeah i spose said harry cautiously hagrid seemed to be in a very strange mood family said hagrid gloomily whatever yeh say blood important and he wiped a trickle of it out of his eye hagrid said harry unable to stop himself where are you getting all these injury eh said hagrid looking startled wha injury all those said harry pointing at hagrid s face oh thas jus normal bump an bruise harry said hagrid dismissively i got a rough job he drained his tankard set it back upon the table and got to his foot ill be seeinyeh harry take care now page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and he lumbered out of the pub looking wretched and then disappeared into the torrential rain harry watched him go feeling miserable hagrid wa unhappy and he wa hiding something but he seemed determined not to accept help what wa going on but before harry could think about the matter any further he heard a voice calling his name harry harry over here hermione wa waving at him from the other side of the room he got up and made his way toward her through the crowded pub he wa still a few table away when he realized that hermione wa not alone she wa sitting at a table with the unlikeliest pair of drinking mate he could ever have imagined luna lovegood and none other than rita skeeter ex journalist on the daily prophet and one of hermiones least favorite people in the world you are early said hermione moving along to give him room to sit down i thought you were with cho i wa not expecting you for another hour at least cho said rita at once twisting around in her seat to stare avidly at harry a girl she snatched up her crocodileskin handbag and groped within it it none of your business if harrys been with a hundred girl hermione told rita coolly so you can put that away right now rita had been on the point of withdrawing an acid green quill from her bag looking a though she had been forced to swallow stinksap she snapped her bag shut again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what are you up to harry asked sitting down and staring from rita to luna to hermione little miss perfect wa just about to tell me when you arrived said rita taking a large slurp of her drink i suppose i am allowed to talk to him am i she shot at hermione yes i suppose you are said hermione coldly unemployment did not suit rita the hair that had once been set in elaborate curl now hung lank and unkempt around her face the scarlet paint on her twoinch talon wa chipped and there were a couple of false jewel missing from her winged glass she took another great gulp of her drink and said out of the corner of her mouth pretty girl is she harry one more word about harrys love life and the deal off and that is a promise said hermione irritably what deal said rita wiping her mouth on the back of her hand you have not mentioned a deal yet miss prissy you just told me to turn up oh one of these day she took a deep shuddering breath yes yes one of these day you will write more horrible story about harry and me said hermione indifferently find someone who care why do not you they have run plenty of horrible story about harry this year without my help said rita shooting a sideways look at him over the top of her glass and adding in a rough whisper how ha that made you feel harry betrayed distraught misunderstood he feel angry of course said hermione in a hard clear voice because he told the minister of magic page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the truth and the minister too much of an idiot to believe him so you actually stick to it do you that hewho mustnotbenamed is back said rita lowering her glass and subjecting harry to a piercing stare while her finger strayed longingly to the clasp of the crocodile bag you stand by all this garbage dumbledores been telling everybody about you knowwho returning and you being the sole witness i wa not the sole witness snarled harry there were a dozenodd death eater there a well want their name id love them breathed rita now fumbling in her bag once more and gazing at him a though he wa the most beautiful thing she had ever seen a great bold headline potter accuses a subheading harry potter name death eater still among u and then beneath a nice big photograph of you disturbed teenage survivor of youknowwhos attack harry potter caused outrage yesterday by accusing respectable and prominent member of the wizarding community of being death eater the quickquotes quill wa actually in her hand and halfway to her mouth when the rapturous expression died out of her face but of course she said lowering the quill and looking dagger at hermione little miss perfect would not want that story out there would she a a matter of fact said hermione sweetly that is exactly what little miss perfect doe want page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling rita stared at her so did harry luna on the other hand sang weasley is our king dreamily under her breath and stirred her drink with a cocktail onion on a stick you want me to report what he say about hewho mustnotbenamed rita asked hermione in a hushed voice yes i do said hermione the true story all the fact exactly a harry report them hell give you all the detail hell tell you the name of the undiscovered death eater he saw there hell tell you what voldemort look like now oh get a grip on yourself she added contemptuously throwing a napkin across the table for at the sound of voldemorts name rita had jumped so badly that she had slopped half her glass of firewhisky down herself rita blotted the front of her grubby raincoat still staring at hermione then she said baldly the prophet would not print it in case you have not noticed nobody belief his cockandbull story everyone think he delusional now if you let me write the story from that angle we do not need another story about how harrys lost his marble said hermione angrily we have had plenty of those already thank you i want him given the opportunity to tell the truth there is no market for a story like that said rita coldly you mean the prophet will not print it because fudge will not let them said hermione irritably rita gave hermione a long hard look then leaning forward across the table toward her she said in a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling businesslike tone all right fudge is leaning on the prophet but it come to the same thing they will not print a story that show harry in a good light nobody want to read it it against the public mood this last azkaban breakout ha got people quite worried enough people just do not want to believe youknow who is back so the daily prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear doe it said hermione scathingly rita sat up straight again her eyebrow raised and drained her glass of firewhisky the prophet exists to sell itself you silly girl she said coldly my dad think it an awful paper said luna chipping into the conversation unexpectedly sucking on her cocktail onion she gazed at rita with her enormous protuberant slightly mad eye he publishes important story that he think the public need to know he doe not care about making money rita looked disparagingly at luna i am guessing your father run some stupid little village newsletter she said twentyfive way to mingle with muggles and the date of the next bring andfly sale no said luna dipping her onion back into her gillywater he the editor of the quibbler rita snorted so loudly that people at a nearby table looked around in alarm page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling important story he think the public need to know she said witheringly i could manure my garden with the content of that rag well this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit is not it said hermione pleasantly luna say her father quite happy to take harrys interview that is who will be publishing it rita stared at them both for a moment and then let out a great whoop of laughter the quibbleii she said cackling you think people will take him seriously if he published in the quibbler some people will not said hermione in a level voice but the daily prophet version of the azkaban breakout had some gaping hole in it i think a lot of people will be wondering whether there is not a better explanation of what happened and if there is an alternative story available even if it is published in a she glanced sideways at luna in a well an unusual magazine i think they might be rather keen to read it rita did not say anything for a while but eyed hermione shrewdly her head a little to one side all right let u say for a moment ill do it she said abruptly what kind of fee am i going to get i do not think daddy exactly pay people to write for the magazine said luna dreamily they do it because it an honor and of course to see their name in print page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling rita skeeter looked a though the taste of stinksap wa strong in her mouth again a she rounded on hermione i am supposed to do this for free well yes said hermione calmly taking a sip of her drink otherwise a you very well know i will inform the authority that you are an unregistered animagus of course the prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider account of life in azkaban rita looked a though she would have liked nothing better than to seize the paper umbrella sticking out of hermione s drink and thrust it up her nose i do not suppose i have got any choice have i said rita her voice shaking slightly she opened her crocodile bag once more withdrew a piece of parchment and raised her quickquotes quill daddy will be pleased said luna brightly a muscle twitched in ritas jaw okay harry said hermione turning to him ready to tell the public the truth i suppose said harry watching rita balancing the quickquotes quill at the ready on the parchment between them fire away then rita said hermione serenely fishing a cherry out of the bottom of her glass page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling seen and unforeseen luna said vaguely that she did not know how soon ritas interview with harry would appear in the quibbler that her father wa expecting a lovely long article on recent sighting of crumplehorned snorkacks and of course that will be a very important story so harrys might have to wait for the following issue said luna harry had not found it an easy experience to talk about the night when voldemort had returned rita had pressed him for every little detail and he had given her everything he could remember knowing that this wa his one big opportunity to tell the world the truth he wondered how people would react to the story he guessed that it would confirm a lot of people in the view that he wa completely insane not least because his story would be appearing alongside utter rubbish about crumplehorned snorkacks but the breakout of bellatrix lestrange and her fellow death eater had given harry a burning desire to do something whether it worked or not page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling can not wait to see what umbridge think of you going public said dean sounding awestruck at dinner on monday night seamus wa shoveling down large amount of chickenandham pie on dean other side but harry knew he wa listening it the right thing to do harry said neville who wa sitting opposite him he wa rather pale but went on in a low voice it must have been tough talking about it wa it yeah mumbled harry but people have got to know what voldemorts capable of have not they that is right said neville nodding and his death eater too people should know neville left his sentence hanging and returned to his baked potato seamus looked up but when he caught harrys eye he looked quickly back at his plate again after a while dean seamus and neville departed for the common room leaving harry and hermione at the table waiting for ron who had not yet had dinner because of quidditch practice cho chang walked into the hall with her friend marietta harrys stomach gave an unpleasant lurch but she did not look over at the gryffindor table and sat down with her back to him oh i forgot to ask you said hermione brightly glancing over at the ravenclaw table what happened on your date with cho how come you were back so early er well it wa said harry pulling a dish of rhubarb crumble toward him and helping himself to second a complete fiasco now that you mention it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and he told her what had happened in madam puddifoots tea shop so then he finished several minute later a the final bit of crumble disappeared she jump up right and say see you around harry and run out of the place he put down his spoon and looked at hermione i mean what wa all that about what wa going on hermione glanced over at the back of chos head and sighed oh harry she said sadly well i am sorry but you were a bit tactless me tactless said harry outraged one minute we were getting on fine next minute she wa telling me that roger davy asked her out and how she used to go and snog cedric in that stupid tea shop how wa i supposed to feel about that well you see said hermione with the patient air of one explaining that one plus one equal two to an overemotional toddler you should not have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date but but spluttered harry but you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along how wa i supposed to do that without telling her you should have told her differently said hermione still with that maddeningly patient air you should have said it wa really annoying but id made you promise to come along to the three broomstick and you really did not want to go you would much rather spend the whole day with her but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please please come along with you and hopefully you would be able to get away more quickly and it might page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think i am too hermione added a an afterthought but i do not think you are ugly said harry bemused hermione laughed harry you are worse than ron well no you are not she sighed a ron himself came stumping into the hall splattered with mud and looking grumpy look you upset cho when you said you were going to meet me so she tried to make you jealous it wa her way of trying to find out how much you liked her is that what she wa doing said harry a ron dropped onto the bench opposite them and pulled every dish within reach toward himself well would not it have been easier if she would just asked me whether i liked her better than you girl do not often ask question like that said hermione well they should said harry forcefully then i could have just told her i fancy her and she would not have had to get herself all worked up again about cedric dying i am not saying what she did wa sensible said hermione a ginny joined them just a muddy a ron and looking equally disgruntled i am just trying to make you see how she wa feeling at the time you should write a book ron told hermione a he cut up his potato translating mad thing girl do so boy can understand them yeah said harry fervently looking over at the ravenclaw table cho had just got up still not looking page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling at him she left the great hall feeling rather depressed he looked back at ron and ginny so how wa quidditch practice it wa a nightmare said ron in a surly voice oh come on said hermione looking at ginny i am sure it wa not that yes it wa said ginny it wa appalling angelina wa nearly in tear by the end of it ron and ginny went off for bath after dinner harry and hermione returned to the busy gryffindor common room and their usual pile of homework harry had been struggling with a new star chart for astronomy for half an hour when fred and george turned up ron and ginny not here asked fred looking around a he pulled up a chair and when harry shook his head he said good we were watching their practice they are going to be slaughtered they are complete rubbish without u come on ginnys not bad said george fairly sitting down next to fred actually i do not know how she got so good seeing how we never let her play with u she is been breaking into your broom she would in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your broom out in turn when you were not looking said hermione from behind her tottering pile of ancient rune book oh said george looking mildly impressed well that would explain it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ha ron saved a goal yet asked hermione peering over the top of magical hieroglyph and logogram well he can do it if he doe not think anyones watching him said fred rolling his eye so all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their back and talk among themselves every time the quaffle go up his end on saturday he got up again and moved restlessly to the window staring out across the dark ground you know quidditch wa about the only thing in this place worth staying for hermione cast him a stern look you have got exam coming told you already were not fussed about newt said fred the snackboxes are ready to roll we found out how to get rid of those boil just a couple of drop of murtlap essence sort them lee put u onto it george yawned widely and looked out disconsolately at the cloudy night sky i do not know if i even want to watch this match if zacharias smith beat u i might have to kill myself kill him more like said fred firmly that is the trouble with quidditch said hermione absentmindedly once again bent over her rune translation it creates all this bad feeling and tension between the house page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she looked up to find her copy of spellmans syllabary and caught fred george and harry looking at her with expression of mingled disgust and incredulity on their face well it doe she said impatiently it only a game is not it hermione said harry shaking his head you are good on feeling and stuff but you just do not understand about quidditch maybe not she said darkly returning to her translation again but at least my happiness doe not depend on ron goalkeeping ability and though harry would rather have jumped off the astronomy tower than admit it to her by the time he had watched the game the following saturday he would have given any number of galleon not to care about quidditch either the very best thing you could say about the match wa that it wa short the gryffindor spectator had to endure only twentytwo minute of agony it wa hard to say what the worst thing wa harry thought it wa a closerun contest between ron fourteenth failed save sloper missing the bludger but hitting angelina in the mouth with his bat and kirke shrieking and falling backward off his broom a zacharias smith zoomed at him carrying the quaffle the miracle wa that gryffindor only lost by ten point ginny managed to snatch the snitch from right under hufflepuff seeker summerbys nose so that the final score wa two hundred and forty versus two hundred and thirty page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling good catch harry told ginny back in the common room where the atmosphere closely resembled that of a particularly dismal funeral i wa lucky she shrugged it wa not a very fast snitch and summerbys got a cold he sneezed and closed his eye at exactly the wrong moment anyway once you are back on the team ginny i have got a lifelong ban you are banned a long a umbridge is in the school ginny corrected him there is a difference anyway once you are back i think ill try out for chaser angelina and alicia are both leaving next year and i prefer goalscoring to seeking anyway harry looked over at ron who wa hunched in a corner staring at his knee a bottle of butterbeer clutched in his hand angelina still will not let him resign ginny said a though reading harrys mind she say she know he got it in him harry liked angelina for the faith she wa showing in ron but at the same time thought it would really be kinder to let him leave the team ron had left the pitch to another booming chorus of weasley is our king sung with great gusto by the slytherins who were now favorite to win the quidditch cup fred and george wandered over i have not got the heart to take the mickey out of him even said fred looking over at ron crumpled figure mind you when he missed the fourteenth page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he made wild motion with his arm a though doing an upright doggypaddle well ill save it for party eh ron dragged himself up to bed shortly after this out of respect for his feeling harry waited a while before going up to the dormitory himself so that ron could pretend to be asleep if he wanted to sure enough when harry finally entered the room ron wa snoring a little too loudly to be entirely plausible harry got into bed thinking about the match it had been immensely frustrating watching from the sideline he wa quite impressed by ginnys performance but he felt that if he had been playing he could have caught the snitch sooner there had been a moment when it had been fluttering near kirkes ankle if she had not hesitated she might have been able to scrape a win for gryffindor umbridge had been sitting a few row below harry and hermione once or twice she had turned squatly in her seat to look at him her wide toad mouth stretched in what he thought had been a gloating smile the memory of it made him feel hot with anger a he lay there in the dark after a few minute however he remembered that he wa supposed to be emptying his mind of all emotion before he slept a snape kept instructing him at the end of every occlumency lesson he tried for a moment or two but the thought of snape on top of memory of umbridge merely increased his sense of grumbling resentment and he found himself focusing instead on how much he loathed the pair of them slowly ron snore died away replaced by the sound of deep slow breathing it took harry much longer to get to sleep his body page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wa tired but it took his brain a long time to close down he dreamed that neville and professor sprout were waltzing around the room of requirement while professor mcgonagall played the bagpipe he watched them happily for a while then decided to go and find the other member of the da but when he left the room he found himself facing not the tapestry of barnabas the barmy but a torch burning in it bracket on a stone wall he turned his head slowly to the left there at the far end of the windowless passage wa a plain black door he walked toward it with a sense of mounting excitement he had the strangest feeling that this time he wa going to get lucky at last and find the way to open it he wa foot from it and saw with a leap of excitement that there wa a glowing strip of faint blue light down the righthand side the door wa ajar he stretched out his hand to push it wide and ron gave a loud rasping genuine snore and harry awoke abruptly with his right hand stretched in front of him in the darkness to open a door that wa hundred of mile away he let it fall with a feeling of mingled disappointment and guilt he knew he should not have seen the door but at the same time felt so consumed with curiosity about what wa behind it that he could not help feeling annoyed with ron if he could have saved his snore for just another minute k k k page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they entered the great hall for breakfast at exactly the same moment a the post owl on monday morning hermione wa not the only person eagerly awaiting her daily prophet nearly everyone wa eager for more news about the escaped death eater who despite many reported sighting had still not been caught she gave the delivery owl a knut and unfolded the newspaper eagerly while harry helped himself to orange juice a he had only received one note during the entire year he wa sure when the first owl landed with a thud in front of him that it had made a mistake who re you after he asked it languidly removing his orange juice from underneath it beak and leaning forward to see the recipient name and address harry potter great hall hogwarts school frowning he made to take the letter from the owl but before he could do so three four five more owl had fluttered down beside it and were jockeying for position treading in the butter knocking over the salt and each attempting to give him their letter first what is going on ron asked in amazement a the whole of gryffindor table leaned forward to watch a another seven owl landed amongst the first one screeching hooting and flapping their wing harry said hermione breathlessly plunging her hand into the feathery mass and pulling out a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling screech owl bearing a long cylindrical package i think i know what this mean open this one first harry ripped off the brown packaging out rolled a tightly furled copy of march edition of the quibbler he unrolled it to see his own face grinning sheepishly at him from the front cover in large red letter across his picture were the word harry potter speaks out at last the truth about hewhomustnotbe named and the night i saw him return it good is not it said luna who had drifted over to the gryffindor table and now squeezed herself onto the bench between fred and ron it came out yesterday i asked dad to send you a free copy i expect all these she waved a hand at the assembled owl still scrabbling around on the table in front of harry are letter from reader that is what i thought said hermione eagerly harry dyou mind if we help yourself said harry feeling slightly bemused ron and hermione both started ripping open envelope this one from a bloke who think you are off your rocker said ron glancing down his letter ah well this woman recommends you try a good course of shock spell at st mungos said hermione looking disappointed and crumpling up a second page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling this one look okay though said harry slowly scanning a long letter from a witch in paisley hey she say she belief me this one in two mind said fred who had joined in the letteropening with enthusiasm say you do not come across a a mad person but he really doe not want to believe youknow who is back so he doe not know what to think now blimey what a waste of parchment here is another one you have convinced harry said hermione excitedly having read your side of the story i am forced to the conclusion that the daily prophet ha treated you very unfairly little though i want to think that hewhomustnotbenamed ha returned i am forced to accept that you are telling the truth oh this is wonderful another one who think you are barking said ron throwing a crumpled letter over his shoulder but this one say you have got her converted and she now think you are a real hero she is put in a photograph too wow what is going on here said a falsely sweet girlish voice harry looked up with his hand full of envelope professor umbridge wa standing behind fred and luna her bulging toad eye scanning the mess of owl and letter on the table in front of harry behind her he saw many of the student watching them avidly why have you got all these letter mr potter she asked slowly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling is that a crime now said fred loudly getting mail be careful mr weasley or i shall have to put you in detention said umbridge well mr potter harry hesitated but he did not see how he could keep what he had done quiet it wa surely only a matter of time before a copy of the quibbler came to umbridges attention people have written to me because i gave an interview said harry about what happened to me last june for some reason he glanced up at the staff table a he said this he had the strangest feeling that dumbledore had been watching him a second before but when he looked dumbledore seemed to be absorbed in conversation with professor flitwick an interview repeated umbridge her voice thinner and higher than ever what do you mean i mean a reporter asked me question and i answered them said harry here and he threw the copy of the quibbler at her she caught it and stared down at the cover her pale doughy face turned an ugly patchy violet when did you do this she asked her voice trembling slightly last hogsmeade weekend said harry she looked up at him incandescent with rage the magazine shaking in her stubby finger page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there will be no more hogsmeade trip for you mr potter she whispered how you dare how you could she took a deep breath i have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lie the message apparently ha still not sunk in fifty point from gryffindor and another week worth of detention she stalked away clutching the quibbler to her chest the eye of many student following her by midmorning enormous sign had been put up all over the school not just on house notice board but in the corridor and classroom too by order of the high inquisitor of hogwarts any student found in possession of the magazine the quibbler will be expelled the above is in accordance with educational decree number twentyseven signed dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor for some reason every time hermione caught sight of one of these sign she beamed with pleasure what exactly are you so happy about harry asked her page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh harry do not you see hermione breathed if she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview it wa banning it and it seemed that hermione wa quite right by the end of that day though harry had not seen so much a a corner of the quibbler anywhere in the school the whole place seemed to be quoting the interview at each other harry heard them whispering about it a they queued up outside class discussing it over lunch and in the back of lesson while hermione even reported that every occupant of the cubicle in the girl toilet had been talking about it when she nipped in there before ancient rune and then they spotted me and obviously they know i know you so they were bombarding me with question hermione told harry her eye shining and harry i think they believe you i really do i think you have finally got them convinced meanwhile professor umbridge wa stalking the school stopping student at random and demanding that they turn out their book and pocket harry knew she wa looking for copy of the quibbler but the student were several step ahead of her the page carrying harrys interview had been bewitched to resemble extract from textbook if anyone but themselves read it or else wiped magically blank until they wanted to peruse it again soon it seemed that every single person in the school had read it the teacher were of course forbidden from mentioning the interview by educational decree number twentysix but they found way to express their feeling about it all the same professor sprout awarded gryffindor twenty point when harry passed her a watering can a beaming professor flitwick page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling pressed a box of squeaking sugar mouse on him at the end of charm said shh and hurried away and professor trelawney broke into hysterical sob during divination and announced to the startled class and a very disapproving umbridge that harry wa not going to suffer an early death after all but would live to a ripe old age become minister of magic and have twelve child but what made harry happiest wa cho catching up with him a he wa hurrying along to transfiguration the next day before he knew what had happened her hand wa in his and she wa breathing in his ear i am really really sorry that interview wa so brave it made me cry he wa sorry to hear she had she would even more tear over it but very glad they were on speaking term again and even more pleased when she gave him a swift kiss on the cheek and hurried off again and unbelievably no sooner had he arrived outside transfiguration than something just a good happened seamus stepped out of the queue to face him i just wanted to say he mumbled squinting at harrys left knee i believe you and i have sent a copy of that magazine to me mam if anything more wa needed to complete harrys happiness it wa malfoy crabbe and goyles reaction he saw them with their head together later that afternoon in the library together with a weedylooking boy hermione whispered wa called theodore nott they looked around at harry a he browsed the shelf for the book he needed on partial vanishment and goyle cracked his knuckle threateningly and malfoy whispered something undoubtedly malevolent to crabbe harry knew page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling perfectly well why they were acting like this he had named all of their father a death eater and the best bit is whispered hermione gleefully a they left the library they can not contradict you because they can not admit they have read the article to cap it all luna told him over dinner that no copy of the quibbler had ever sold out faster dad reprinting she told harry her eye popping excitedly he can not believe it he say people seem even more interested in this than the crumple horned snorkacks harry wa a hero in the gryffindor common room that night daringly fred and george had put an enlargement charm on the front cover of the quibbler and hung it on the wall so that harrys giant head gazed down upon the proceeding occasionally saying thing like the ministry are moron and eat dung umbridge in a booming voice hermione did not find this very amusing she said it interfered with her concentration and ended up going to bed early out of irritation harry had to admit that the poster wa not quite a funny after an hour or two especially when the talking spell had started to wear off so that it merely shouted disconnected word like dung and umbridge at more and more frequent interval in a progressively higher voice in fact it started to make his head ache and his scar began prickling uncomfortably again to disappointed moan from the many people who were sitting around him asking him to relive his interview for the umpteenth time he announced that he too needed an early night the dormitory wa empty when he reached it he rested his forehead for a moment against the cool page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling glass of the window beside his bed it felt soothing against his scar then he undressed and got into bed wishing his headache would go away he also felt slightly sick he rolled over onto his side closed his eye and fell asleep almost at once he wa standing in a dark curtained room lit by a single branch of candle his hand were clenched on the back of a chair in front of him they were long fingered and white a though they had not seen sunlight for year and looked like large pale spider against the dark velvet of the chair beyond the chair in a pool of light cast upon the floor by the candle knelt a man in black robe i have been badly advised it seems said harry in a high cold voice that pulsed with anger master i crave your pardon croaked the man kneeling on the floor the back of his head glimmered in the candlelight he seemed to be trembling i do not blame you rookwood said harry in that cold cruel voice he relinquished his grip upon the chair and walked around it closer to the man cowering upon the floor until he stood directly over him in the darkness looking down from a far greater height than usual you are sure of your fact rookwood asked harry yes my lord yes i used to work in the department after after all avery told me bode would be able to remove it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling bode could never have taken it master bode would have known he could not undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard against malfoys imperius curse stand up rookwood whispered harry the kneeling man almost fell over in his haste to obey his face wa pockmarked the scar were thrown into relief by the candlelight he remained a little stooped when standing a though halfway through a bow and he darted terrified look up at harrys face you have done well to tell me this said harry very well i have wasted month on fruitless scheme it seems but no matter we begin again from now you have lord voldemorts gratitude rookwood my lord yes my lord gasped rookwood his voice hoarse with relief i shall need your help i shall need all the information you can give me of course my lord of course anything very well you may go send avery to me rookwood scurried backward bowing and disappeared through a door left alone in the dark room harry turned toward the wall a cracked agespotted mirror hung on the wall in the shadow harry moved toward it his reflection grew larger and clearer in the darkness a face whiter than a skull red eye with slit for pupil nooooooooo page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what yelled a voice nearby harry flailed around madly became entangled in the hanging and fell out of his bed for a few second he did not know where he wa he wa convinced that he wa about to see the white skulllike face looming at him out of the dark again then ron voice spoke very near to him will you stop acting like a maniac and i can get you out of here ron wrenched the hanging apart and harry stared up at him in the moonlight a he lay flat on his back his scar searing with pain ron looked a though he had just been getting ready for bed one arm wa out of his robe ha someone been attacked again asked ron pulling harry roughly to his foot is it dad is it that snake no everyone is fine gasped harry whose forehead felt a though it wa on fire again well avery is not he in trouble he gave him the wrong information he really angry harry groaned and sank shaking onto his bed rubbing his scar but rookwoods going to help him now he on the right track again what are you talking about said ron sounding scared dyou mean did you just see youknow who i wa youknowwho said harry and he stretched out his hand in the darkness and held them up to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling his face to check that they were no longer deathly white and longfingered he wa with rookwood he one of the death eater who escaped from azkaban remember rookwoods just told him bode could not have done it done what remove something he said bode would have known he could not have done it bode wa under the imperius curse i think he said malfoys dad put it on him bode wa bewitched to remove something ron said but harry that is got to be the weapon harry finished the sentence for him i know the dormitory door opened dean and seamus came in harry swung his leg back into bed he did not want to look a though anything odd had just happened seeing a seamus had only just stopped thinking harry wa a nutter did you say murmured ron putting his head close to harrys on the pretense of helping himself to water from the jug on his bedside table that you were you knowwho yeah said harry quietly ron took an unnecessarily large gulp of water harry saw it spill over his chin onto his chest harry he said a dean and seamus clattered around noisily pulling off their robe and talking you have got to tell page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i have not got to tell anyone said harry shortly i would not have seen it at all if i could do occlumency i am supposed to have learned to shut this stuff out that is what they want by they he meant dumbledore he got back into bed and rolled over onto his side with his back to ron and after a while he heard ron mattress creak a he lay back down too his scar began to burn he bit hard on his pillow to stop himself making a noise somewhere he knew avery wa being punished harry and ron waited until break next morning to tell hermione exactly what had happened they wanted to be absolutely sure they could not be overheard standing in their usual corner of the cool and breezy courtyard harry told her every detail of the dream he could remember when he had finished she said nothing at all for a few moment but stared with a kind of painful intensity at fred and george who were both headless and selling their magical hat from under their cloak on the other side of the yard so that is why they killed him she said quietly withdrawing her gaze from fred and george at last when bode tried to steal this weapon something funny happened to him i think there must be defensive spell on it or around it to stop people from touching it that is why he wa in st mungos his brain had gone all funny and he could not talk but remember what the healer told u he wa recovering and they could not risk him getting better could they i mean the shock of whatever happened when he touched that weapon probably made the imperius curse lift once he would got his voice back he would explain what he would been doing would not he they would have known he would been sent to steal the weapon of course it would have been easy for page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling lucius malfoy to put the curse on him never out of the ministry is he he wa even hanging around that day i had my hearing said harry in the hang on he said slowly he wa in the department of mystery corridor that day your dad said he wa probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing but what if sturgis gasped hermione looking thunderstruck sorry said ron looking bewildered sturgis podmore said hermione breathlessly arrested for trying to get through a door lucius malfoy got him too i bet he did it the day you saw him there harry sturgis had moody invisibility cloak right so what if he wa standing guard by the door invisible and malfoy heard him move or guessed he wa there or just did the imperius curse on the off chance that a guard wa there so when sturgis next had an opportunity probably when it wa his turn on guard duty again he tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for voldemort ron be quiet but he got caught and sent to azkaban she gazed at harry and now rookwoods told voldemort how to get the weapon i did not hear all the conversation but that is what it sounded like said harry rookwood used to work there maybe voldemortll send rookwood to do it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hermione nodded apparently still lost in thought then quite abruptly she said but you should not have seen this at all harry what he said taken aback you are supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing said hermione suddenly stern i know i am said harry but well i think we should just try and forget what you saw said hermione firmly and you ought to put in a bit more effort on your occlumency from now on harry wa so angry with her that he did not talk to her for the rest of the day which proved to be another bad one when people were not discussing the escaped death eater in the corridor today they were laughing at gryffindors abysmal performance in their match against hufflepuff the slytherins were singing weasley is our king so loudly and frequently that by sundown filch had banned it from the corridor out of sheer irritation the week did not improve a it progressed harry received two more d in potion wa still on tenterhook that hagrid might get the sack and could not stop himself from dwelling on the dream in which he had seen voldemort though he did not bring it up with ron and hermione again because he did not want another tellingoff from hermione he wished very much that he could have talked to sirius about it but that wa out of the question so he tried to push the matter to the back of his mind unfortunately the back of his mind wa no longer the secure place it had once been page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling get up potter a couple of week after his dream of rookwood harry wa to be found yet again kneeling on the floor of snapes office trying to clear his head he had just been forced yet again to relive a stream of very early memory he had not even realized he still had most of them concerning humiliation dudley and his gang had inflicted upon him in primary school that last memory said snape what wa it i do not know said harry getting wearily to his foot he wa finding it increasingly difficult to disentangle separate memory from the rush of image and sound that snape kept calling forth you mean the one where my cousin tried to make me stand in the toilet no said snape softly i mean the one concerning a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room it nothing said harry snapes dark eye bored into harrys remembering what snape had said about eye contact being crucial to legilimency harry blinked and looked away how do that man and that room come to be inside your head potter said snape it said harry looking everywhere but at snape it wa just a dream i had a dream repeated snape there wa a pause during which harry stared fixedly at a large dead frog suspended in a purple liquid in it jar page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you do know why we are here do not you potter said snape in a low dangerous voice you do know why i am giving up my evening to this tedious job yes said harry stiffly remind me why we are here potter so i can learn occlumency said harry now glaring at a dead eel correct potter and dim though you may be harry looked back at snape hating him i would have thought that after two month worth of lesson you might have made some progress how many other dream about the dark lord have you had just that one lied harry perhaps said snape his dark cold eye narrowing slightly perhaps you actually enjoy having these vision and dream potter maybe they make you feel special important no they do not said harry his jaw set and his finger clenched tightly around the handle of his wand that is just a well potter said snape coldly because you are neither special nor important and it is not up to you to find out what the dark lord is saying to his death eater no that is your job is not it harry shot at him he had not meant to say it it had burst out of him in temper for a long moment they stared at each other harry convinced he had gone too far but there wa a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling curious almost satisfied expression on snapes face when he answered yes potter he said his eye glinting that is my job now if you are ready we will start again he raised his wand one two three legilimensv a hundred dementors were swooping toward harry across the lake in the ground he screwed up his face in concentration they were coming closer he could see the dark hole beneath their hood yet he could also see snape standing in front of him his eye fixed upon harrys face muttering under his breath and somehow snape wa growing clearer and the dementors were growing fainter harry raised his own wand protegol snape staggered his wand flew upward away from harry and suddenly harrys mind wa teeming with memory that were not his a hooknosed man wa shouting at a cowering woman while a small darkhaired boy cried in a corner a greasyhaired teenager sat alone in a dark bedroom pointing his wand at the ceiling shooting down fly a girl wa laughing a a scrawny boy tried to mount a bucking broomstick enough harry felt a though he had been pushed hard in the chest he took several staggering step backward hit some of the shelf covering snapes wall and heard something crack snape wa shaking slightly very white in the face page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the back of harrys robe were damp one of the jar behind him had broken when he fell against it the pickled slimy thing within wa swirling in it draining potion reparo hissed snape and the jar sealed itself once more well potter that wa certainly an improvement panting slightly snape straightened the pensieve in which he had again stored some of his thought before starting the lesson almost a though checking that they were still there i do not remember telling you to use a shield charm but there is no doubt that it wa effective harry did not speak he felt that to say anything might be dangerous he wa sure he had just broken into snapes memory that he had just seen scene from snapes childhood and it wa unnerving to think that the cry little boy who had watched his parent shouting wa actually standing in front of him with such loathing in his eye let u try again shall we said snape harry felt a thrill of dread he wa about to pay for what had just happened he wa sure of it they moved back into position with the desk between them harry feeling he wa going to find it much harder to empty his mind this time on the count of three then said snape raising his wand once more one two harry did not have time to gather himself together and attempt to clear his mind for snape had already cried legilimens he wa hurtling along the corridor toward the department of mystery past the blank stone wall page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling past the torch the plain black door wa growing ever larger he wa moving so fast he wa going to collide with it he wa foot from it and he could see that chink of faint blue light again the door had flown open he wa through it at last inside a blackwalled blackfloored circular room lit with blueflamed candle and there were more door all around him he needed to go on but which door ought he to take potter harry opened his eye he wa flat on his back again with no memory of having gotten there he wa also panting a though he really had run the length of the department of mystery corridor really had sprinted through the black door and found the circular room explain yourself said snape who wa standing over him looking furious i do not know what happened said harry truthfully standing up there wa a lump on the back of his head from where he had hit the ground and he felt feverish i have never seen that before i mean i told you i have dreamed about the door but it never opened before you are not working hard enough for some reason snape seemed even angrier than he had done two minute before when harry had seen into his own memory you are lazy and sloppy potter it is small wonder that the dark lord page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling can you tell me something sir said harry firing up again why do you call voldemort the dark lord i have only ever heard death eater call him that snape opened his mouth in a snarl and a woman screamed from somewhere outside the room snapes head jerked upward he wa gazing at the ceiling what the he muttered harry could hear a muffled commotion coming from what he thought might be the entrance hall snape looked around at him frowning did you see anything unusual on your way down here potter harry shook his head somewhere above them the woman screamed again snape strode to his office door his wand still held at the ready and swept out of sight harry hesitated for a moment then followed the scream were indeed coming from the entrance hall they grew louder a harry ran toward the stone step leading up from the dungeon when he reached the top he found the entrance hall packed student had come flooding out of the great hall where dinner wa still in progress to see what wa going on others had crammed themselves onto the marble staircase harry pushed forward through a knot of tall slytherins and saw that the onlooker had formed a great ring some of them looking shocked others even frightened professor mcgonagall wa directly opposite harry on the other side of the hall she looked a though what she wa watching made her feel faintly sick page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor trelawney wa standing in the middle of the entrance hall with her wand in one hand and an empty sherry bottle in the other looking utterly mad her hair wa sticking up on end her glass were lopsided so that one eye wa magnified more than the other her innumerable shawl and scarf were trailing haphazardly from her shoulder giving the impression that she wa falling apart at the seam two large trunk lay on the floor beside her one of them upside down it looked very much a though it had been thrown down the stair after her professor trelawney wa staring apparently terrified at something harry could not see but that seemed to be standing at the foot of the stair no she shrieked no this can not be happening it can not i refuse to accept it you did not realize this wa coming said a high girlish voice sounding callously amused and harry moving slightly to his right saw that trelawneys terrifying vision wa nothing other than professor umbridge incapable though you are of predicting even tomorrow weather you must surely have realized that your pitiful performance during my inspection and lack of any improvement would make it inevitable you would be sacked you ccant howled professor trelawney tear streaming down her face from behind her enormous lens you ccant sack me i have bbeen here sixteen year hhogwarts is mmy hhome it wa your home said professor umbridge and harry wa revolted to see the enjoyment stretching her toadlike face a she watched professor trelawney sink sobbing uncontrollably onto one of her trunk until an hour ago when the minister of magic countersigned the order for your dismissal now page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling kindly remove yourself from this hall you are embarrassing u but she stood and watched with an expression of gloating enjoyment a professor trelawney shuddered and moaned rocking backward and forward on her trunk in paroxysm of grief harry heard a sob to his left and looked around lavender and parvati were both cry silently their arm around each other then he heard footstep professor mcgonagall had broken away from the spectator marched straight up to professor trelawney and wa patting her firmly on the back while withdrawing a large handkerchief from within her robe there there sibyll calm down blow your nose on this it not a bad a you think now you are not going to have to leave hogwarts oh really professor mcgonagall said umbridge in a deadly voice taking a few step forward and your authority for that statement is that would be mine said a deep voice the oak front door had swung open student beside them scuttled out of the way a dumbledore appeared in the entrance what he had been doing out in the ground harry could not imagine but there wa something impressive about the sight of him framed in the doorway against an oddly misty night leaving the door wide behind him he strode forward through the circle of onlooker toward the place where professor trelawney sat tearstained and trembling upon her trunk professor mcgonagall alongside her yours professor dumbledore said umbridge with a singularly unpleasant little laugh i am afraid you do page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling not understand the position i have here she pulled a parchment scroll from within her robe an order of dismissal signed by myself and the minister of magic under the term of educational decree number twentythree the high inquisitor of hogwarts ha the power to inspect place upon probation and sack any teacher she that is to say i feel is not performing up to the standard required by the ministry of magic i have decided that professor trelawney is not up to scratch i have dismissed her to harrys very great surprise dumbledore continued to smile he looked down at professor trelawney who wa still sobbing and choking on her trunk and said you are quite right of course professor umbridge a high inquisitor you have every right to dismiss my teacher you do not however have the authority to send them away from the castle i am afraid he went on with a courteous little bow that the power to do that still resides with the headmaster and it is my wish that professor trelawney continue to live at hogwarts at this professor trelawney gave a wild little laugh in which a hiccup wa barely hidden no no ill ggo dumbledore i shshall leave hogwarts and sseek my fortune elsewhere no said dumbledore sharply it is my wish that you remain sibyll he turned to professor mcgonagall might i ask you to escort sibyll back upstairs professor mcgonagall of course said mcgonagall up you get sibyll page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor sprout came hurrying forward out of the crowd and grabbed professor trelawneys other arm together they guided her past umbridge and up the marble stair professor flitwick went scurrying after them his wand held out before him he squeaked locomotor trunksl and professor trelawneys luggage rose into the air and proceeded up the staircase after her professor flitwick bringing up the rear professor umbridge wa standing stockstill staring at dumbledore who continued to smile benignly and what she said in a whisper that nevertheless carried all around the entrance hall are you going to do with her once i appoint a new divination teacher who need her lodging oh that will not be a problem said dumbledore pleasantly you see i have already found u a new divination teacher and he will prefer lodging on the ground floor you have found said umbridge shrilly you have found might i remind you dumbledore that under educational decree twentytwo the ministry ha the right to appoint a suitable candidate if and only if the headmaster is unable to find one said dumbledore and i am happy to say that on this occasion i have succeeded may i introduce you he turned to face the open front door through which night mist wa now drifting harry heard hoof there wa a shocked murmur around the hall and those nearest the door hastily moved even farther backward some of them tripping over in their haste to clear a path for the newcomer page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling through the mist came a face harry had seen once before on a dark dangerous night in the forbidden forest whiteblond hair and astonishingly blue eye the head and torso of a man joined to the palomino body of a horse this is firenze said dumbledore happily to a thunderstruck umbridge i think you find him suitable page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the centaur and the sneak ill bet you wish you had not given up divination now do not you hermione asked parvati smirking it wa breakfast time a few day after the sacking of professor trelawney and parvati wa curling her eyelash around her wand and examining the effect in the back of her spoon they were to have their first lesson with firenze that morning not really said hermione indifferently who wa reading the daily prophet i have never really liked horse she turned a page of the newspaper scanning it column he not a horse he a centaur said lavender sounding shocked a gorgeous centaur sighed parvati page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling either way he still got four leg said hermione coolly anyway i thought you two were all upset that trelawney had gone we are lavender assured her we went up to her office to see her we took her some daffodil not the honking one that sprout got nice one how is she asked harry not very good poor thing said lavender sympathetically she wa cry and saying she would rather leave the castle forever than stay here if umbridge is still here and i do not blame her umbridge wa horrible to her wa not she i have got a feeling umbridge ha only just started being horrible said hermione darkly impossible said ron who wa tucking into a large plate of egg and bacon she can not get any worse than she is been already you mark my word she is going to want revenge on dumbledore for appointing a new teacher without consulting her said hermione closing the newspaper especially another parthuman you saw the look on her face when she saw firenze after breakfast hermione departed for her arithmancy class and harry and ron followed parvati and lavender into the entrance hall heading for divination are not we going up to north tower asked ron looking puzzled a parvati bypassed the marble staircase parvati looked scornfully over her shoulder at him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling how dyou expect firenze to climb that ladder were in classroom eleven now it wa on the notice board yesterday classroom eleven wa situated in the groundfloor corridor leading off the entrance hall on the opposite side to the great hall harry knew it to be one of those classroom that were never used regularly and that it therefore had the slightly neglected feeling of a cupboard or storeroom when he entered it right behind ron and found himself right in the middle of a forest clearing he wa therefore momentarily stunned what the the classroom floor had become springily mossy and tree were growing out of it their leafy branch fanned across the ceiling and window so that the room wa full of slanting shaft of soft dappled green light the student who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their back resting against tree trunk or boulder arm wrapped around their knee or folded tightly across their chest looking rather nervous in the middle of the room where there were no tree stood firenze harry potter he said holding out a hand when harry entered er hi said harry shaking hand with the centaur who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eye but did not smile er good to see you and you said the centaur inclining his whiteblond head it wa foretold that we would meet again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry noticed that there wa the shadow of a hoof shaped bruise on firenze chest a he turned to join the rest of the class upon the floor he saw that they were all looking at him with awe apparently deeply impressed that he wa on speaking term with firenze whom they seemed to find intimidating when the door wa closed and the last student had sat down upon a tree stump beside the wastepaper basket firenze gestured around the room professor dumbledore ha kindly arranged this classroom for u said firenze when everyone had settled down in imitation of my natural habitat i would have preferred to teach you in the forbidden forest which wa until monday my home but this is not possible please er sir said parvati breathlessly raising her hand why not we have been in there with hagrid were not frightened it is not a question of your bravery said firenze but of my position i can no longer return to the forest my herd ha banished me herd said lavender in a confused voice and harry knew she wa thinking of cow what oh comprehension dawned on her face there are more of you she said stunned did hagrid breed you like the thestrals asked dean eagerly firenze turned his head very slowly to face dean who seemed to realize at once that he had said something very offensive page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i did not i meant sorry he finished in a hushed voice centaur are not the servant or plaything of human said firenze quietly there wa a pause then parvati raised her hand again please sir why have the other centaur banished you because i have agreed to work for professor dumbledore said firenze they see this a a betrayal of our kind harry remembered how nearly four year ago the centaur bane had shouted at firenze for allowing harry to ride to safety upon his back calling him a common mule he wondered whether it had been bane who had kicked firenze in the chest let u begin said firenze he swished his long palomino tail raised his hand toward the leafy canopy overhead then lowered it slowly and a he did so the light in the room dimmed so that they now seemed to be sitting in a forest clearing by twilight and star emerged upon the ceiling there were oohs and gasp and ron said audibly blimey lie back upon the floor said firenze in his calm voice and observe the heaven here is written for those who can see the fortune of our race harry stretched out on his back and gazed upward at the ceiling a twinkling red star winked at him from overhead i know that you have learned the name of the planet and their moon in astronomy said firenze calm voice and that you have mapped the star page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling progress through the heaven centaur have unraveled the mystery of these movement over century our finding teach u that the future may be glimpsed in the sky above u professor trelawney did astrology with u said parvati excitedly raising her hand in front of her so that it stuck up in the air a she lay on her back mar cause accident and burn and thing like that and when it make an angle to saturn like now she drew a right angle in the air above her that mean that people need to be extra careful when handling hot thing that said firenze calmly is human nonsense parvati hand fell limply to her side trivial hurt tiny human accident said firenze a his hoof thudded over the mossy floor these are of no more significance than the scurryings of ant to the wide universe and are unaffected by planetary movement professor trelawney began parvati in a hurt and indignant voice is a human said firenze simply and is therefore blinkered and fettered by the limitation of your kind harry turned his head very slightly to look at parvati she looked very offended a did several of the people surrounding her sibyll trelawney may have seen i do not know continued firenze and harry heard the swishing of his tail again a he walked up and down before them but she waste her time in the main on the self p a g e harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling flattering nonsense human call fortunetelling i however am here to explain the wisdom of centaur which is impersonal and impartial we watch the sky for the great tide of evil or change that are sometimes marked there it may take ten year to be sure of what we are seeing firenze pointed to the red star directly above harry in the past decade the indication have been that wizardkind is living through nothing more than a brief calm between two war mar bringer of battle shine brightly above u suggesting that the fight must break out again soon how soon centaur may attempt to divine by the burning of certain herb and leaf by the observation of fume and flame it wa the most unusual lesson harry had ever attended they did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor and firenze told them to look for certain shape and symbol in the pungent fume but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the sign he described telling them that human were hardly ever good at this that it took centaur year and year to become competent and finished by telling them that it wa foolish to put too much faith in such thing anyway because even centaur sometimes read them wrongly he wa nothing like any human teacher harry had ever had his priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew but rather to impress upon them that nothing not even centaur knowledge wa foolproof he not very definite on anything is he said ron in a low voice a they put out their mallowsweet fire i mean i could do with a few more detail about this war were about to have could not you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the bell rang right outside the classroom door and everyone jumped harry had completely forgotten that they were still inside the castle quite convinced that he wa really in the forest the class filed out looking slightly perplexed harry and ron were on the point of following them when firenze called harry potter a word please harry turned the centaur advanced a little toward him ron hesitated you may stay firenze told him but close the door please ron hastened to obey harry potter you are a friend of hagrids are you not said the centaur yes said harry then give him a warning from me his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon it his attempt is not working harry repeated blankly and he would do better to abandon it said firenze nodding i would warn hagrid myself but i am banished it would be unwise for me to go too near the forest now hagrid ha trouble enough without a centaur battle but what is hagrid attempting to do said harry nervously firenze looked at harry impassively hagrid ha recently rendered me a great service said firenze and he ha long since earned my page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling respect for the care he show all living creature i shall not betray his secret but he must be brought to his sens the attempt is not working tell him harry potter good day to you the happiness harry had felt in the aftermath of the quibbler interview had long since evaporated a a dull march blurred into a squally april his life seemed to have become one long series of worry and problem again umbridge had continued attending all care of magical creature lesson so it had been very difficult to deliver firenze warning to hagrid at last harry had managed it by pretending he had lost his copy of fantastic beast and where to find them and doubling back after class one day when he passed on firenze message hagrid gazed at him for a moment through his puffy blackened eye apparently taken aback then he seemed to pull himself together nice bloke firenze he said gruffly but he don know what he talkin abou on this the attemps cornin on fine hagrid what are you up to asked harry seriously because you have got to be careful umbridge ha already sacked trelawney and if you ask me she is on a roll if you are doing anything you should not be there is thing more importan than keepin a job said hagrid though his hand shook slightly a he said this and a basin full of knarl droppings crashed to the floor don worry abou me harry jus get along now there is a good lad page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry had no choice but to leave hagrid mopping up the dung all over his floor but he felt thoroughly dispirited a he trudged back up to the castle meanwhile a the teacher and hermione persisted in reminding them the owl were drawing ever nearer all the fifth year were suffering from stress to some degree but hannah abbott became the first to receive a calming draught from madam pomfrey after she burst into tear during herbology and sobbed that she wa too stupid to take exam and wanted to leave school now if it had not been for the da lesson harry thought he would have been extremely unhappy he sometimes felt that he wa living for the hour he spent in the room of requirement working hard but thoroughly enjoying himself at the same time swelling with pride a he looked around at his fellow da member and saw how far they had come indeed harry sometimes wondered how umbridge wa going to react when all the member of the da received outstanding in their defense against the dark art owl they had finally started work on patronuses which everybody had been very keen to practice though a harry kept reminding them producing a patronus in the middle of a brightly lit classroom when they were not under threat wa very different to producing it when confronted by something like a dementor oh do not be such a killjoy said cho brightly watching her silvery swanshaped patronus soar around the room of requirement during their last lesson before easter they are so pretty they are not supposed to be pretty they are supposed to protect you said harry patiently what we really page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling need is a boggart or something that is how i learned i had to conjure a patronus while the boggart wa pretending to be a dementor but that would be really scary said lavender who wa shooting puff of silver vapor out of the end of her wand and i still can not do it she added angrily neville wa having trouble too his face wa screwed up in concentration but only feeble wisp of silver smoke issued from his wand tip you have got to think of something happy harry reminded him i am trying said neville miserably who wa trying so hard his round face wa actually shining with sweat harry i think i am doing it yelled seamus who had been brought along to his first ever da meeting by dean look ah it gone but it wa definitely something hairy harry hermiones patronus a shining silver otter wa gamboling around her they are sort of nice are not they she said looking at it fondly the door of the room of requirement opened and then closed again harry looked around to see who had entered but there did not seem to be anybody there it wa a few moment before he realized that the people close to the door had fallen silent next thing he knew something wa tugging at his robe somewhere near the knee he looked down and saw to his very great astonishment dobby the houseelf peering up at him from beneath his usual eight hat page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hi dobby he said what are you what is wrong for the elf eye were wide with terror and he wa shaking the member of the da closest to harry had fallen silent now everybody in the room wa watching dobby the few patronuses people had managed to conjure faded away into silver mist leaving the room looking much darker than before harry potter sir squeaked the elf trembling from head to foot harry potter sir dobby ha come to warn you but the houseelves have been warned not to tell he ran headfirst at the wall harry who had some experience of dobbys habit of selfpunishment made to seize him but dobby merely bounced off the stone cushioned by his eight hat hermione and a few of the other girl let out squeak of fear and sympathy what is happened dobby harry asked grabbing the elf tiny arm and holding him away from anything with which he might seek to hurt himself harry potter she she dobby hit himself hard on the nose with his free fist harry seized that too who is she dobby but he thought he knew surely only one she could induce such fear in dobby the elf looked up at him slightly crosseyed and mouthed wordlessly umbridge asked harry horrified page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dobby nodded then tried to bang his head off harrys knee harry held him at bay what about her dobby she ha not found out about this about u about the da he read the answer in the elf stricken face his hand held fast by harry the elf tried to kick himself and fell to the floor is she coming harry asked quietly dobby let out a howl and began beating his bare foot hard on the floor yes harry potter yes harry straightened up and looked around at the motionless terrified people gazing at the thrashing elf what are you waiting for harry bellowed run they all pelted toward the exit at once forming a scrum at the door then people burst through harry could hear them sprinting along the corridor and hoped they had the sense not to try and make it all the way to their dormitory it wa only ten to nine if they just took refuge in the library or the owlery which were both nearer harry come on shrieked hermione from the center of the knot of people now fighting to get out he scooped up dobby who wa still attempting to do himself serious injury and ran with the elf in his arm to join the back of the queue dobby this is an order get back down to the kitchen with the other elf and if she asks you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling whether you warned me lie and say no said harry and i forbid you to hurt yourself he added dropping the elf a he made it over the threshold at last and slamming the door behind him thank you harry potter squeaked dobby and he streaked off harry glanced left and right the others were all moving so fast that he caught only glimpse of flying heel at either end of the corridor before they vanished he started to run right there wa a boy bathroom up ahead he could pretend he would been in there all the time if he could just reach it aaargh something caught him around the ankle and he fell spectacularly skidding along on his front for six foot before coming to a halt someone behind him wa laughing he rolled over onto his back and saw malfoy concealed in a niche beneath an ugly dragonshaped vase trip jinx potter he said hey professor professor i have got one umbridge came bustling around the far corner breathless but wearing a delighted smile it him she said jubilantly at the sight of harry on the floor excellent draco excellent oh very good fifty point to slytherin ill take him from here stand up potter harry got to his foot glaring at the pair of them he had never seen umbridge looking so happy she seized his arm in a vicelike grip and turned beaming broadly to malfoy you hop along and see if you can round up anymore of them draco she said tell the others to look in the library anybody out of breath page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling check the bathroom miss parkinson can do the girl one off you go and you she added in her softest most dangerous voice a malfoy walked away you can come with me to the headmaster office potter they were at the stone gargoyle within minute harry wondered how many of the others had been caught he thought of ron mr weasley would kill him and of how hermione would feel if she wa expelled before she could take her owl and it had been seamuss very first meeting and neville had been getting so good fizzing whizbee sang umbridge and the stone gargoyle jumped aside the wall behind split open and they ascended the moving stone staircase they reached the polished door with the griffin knocker but umbridge did not bother to knock she strode straight inside still holding tight to harry the office wa full of people dumbledore wa sitting behind his desk his expression serene the tip of his long finger together professor mcgonagall stood rigidly beside him her face extremely tense cornelius fudge minister of magic wa rocking backward and forward on his toe beside the fire apparently immensely pleased with the situation kingsley shacklebolt and a toughlooking wizard harry did not recognize with very short wiry hair were positioned on either side of the door like guard and the freckled bespectacled form of percy weasley hovered excitedly beside the wall a quill and a heavy scroll of parchment in his hand apparently poised to take note the portrait of old headmaster and mistress were not shamming sleep tonight all of them were watching what wa happening below alert and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling serious a harry entered a few flitted into neighboring frame and whispered urgently into their neighbor ear harry pulled himself free of umbridges grasp a the door swung shut behind them cornelius fudge wa glaring at him with a kind of vicious satisfaction upon his face well he said well well well harry replied with the dirtiest look he could muster his heart drummed madly inside him but his brain wa oddly cool and clear he wa heading back to gryffindor tower said umbridge there wa an indecent excitement in her voice the same callous pleasure harry had heard a she watched professor trelawney dissolving with misery in the entrance hall the malfoy boy cornered him did he did he said fudge appreciatively i must remember to tell lucius well potter i expect you know why you are here harry fully intended to respond with a defiant yes his mouth had opened and the word wa half formed when he caught sight of dumbledores face dumbledore wa not looking directly at harry his eye were fixed upon a point just over his shoulder but a harry stared at him he shook his head a fraction of an inch to each side harry changed direction mid word yeh no i beg your pardon said fudge page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no said harry firmly you do not know why you are here no i do not said harry fudge looked incredulously from harry to professor umbridge harry took advantage of his momentary inattention to steal another quick look at dumbledore who gave the carpet the tiniest of nod and the shadow of a wink so you have no idea said fudge in a voice positively sagging with sarcasm why professor umbridge ha brought you to this office you are not aware that you have broken any school rule school rule said harry no or ministry decree amended fudge angrily not that i am aware of said harry blandly his heart wa still hammering very fast it wa almost worth telling these lie to watch fudge blood pressure rising but he could not see how on earth he would get away with them if somebody had tipped off umbridge about the da then he the leader might a well be packing his trunk right now so it news to you is it said fudge his voice now thick with anger that an illegal student organization ha been discovered within this school yes it is said harry hoisting an unconvincing look of innocent surprise onto his face page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i think minister said umbridge silkily from beside him we might make better progress if i fetch our informant yes yes do said fudge nodding and he glanced maliciously at dumbledore a umbridge left the room there is nothing like a good witness is there dumbledore nothing at all cornelius said dumbledore gravely inclining his head there wa a wait of several minute in which nobody looked at each other then harry heard the door open behind him umbridge moved past him into the room gripping by the shoulder chos curlyhaired friend marietta who wa hiding her face in her hand do not be scared dear do not be frightened said professor umbridge softly patting her on the back it quite all right now you have done the right thing the minister is very pleased with you hell be telling your mother what a good girl you have been mariettas mother minister she added looking up at fudge is madam edgecombe from the department of magical transportation floo network office she is been helping u police the hogwarts fire you know jolly good jolly good said fudge heartily like mother like daughter eh well come on now dear look up do not be shy let u hear what you have got to galloping gargoyle a marietta raised her head fudge leapt backward in shock nearly landing himself in the fire he cursed and stamped on the hem of his cloak which had started to smoke and marietta gave a wail and pulled the neck of her robe right up to her eye but not before the whole room had seen that her face wa page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling horribly disfigured by a series of close set purple pustule that had spread across her nose and cheek to form the word sneak never mind the spot now dear said umbridge impatiently just take your robe away from your mouth and tell the minister but marietta gave another muffled wail and shook her head frantically oh very well you silly girl ill tell him snapped umbridge she hitched her sickly smile back onto her face and said well minister miss edgecombe here came to my office shortly after dinner this evening and told me she had something she wanted to tell me she said that if i proceeded to a secret room on the seventh floor sometimes known a the room of requirement i would find out something to my advantage i questioned her a little further and she admitted that there wa to be some kind of meeting there unfortunately at that point this hex she waved impatiently at mariettas concealed face came into operation and upon catching sight of her face in my mirror the girl became too distressed to tell me any more well now said fudge fixing marietta with what he evidently imagined wa a kind and fatherly look it is very brave of you my dear coming to tell professor umbridge you did exactly the right thing now will you tell me what happened at this meeting what wa it purpose who wa there but marietta would not speak she merely shook her head again her eye wide and fearful page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling have not we got a counterjinx for this fudge asked umbridge impatiently gesturing at mariettas face so she can speak freely i have not yet managed to find one umbridge admitted grudgingly and harry felt a surge of pride in hermiones jinxing ability but it doe not matter if she will not speak i can take up the story from here you will remember minister that i sent you a report back in october that potter had met a number of fellow student in the hog head in hogsmeade and what is your evidence for that cut in professor mcgonagall i have testimony from willy widdershins minerva who happened to be in the bar at the time he wa heavily bandaged it is true but his hearing wa quite unimpaired said umbridge smugly he heard every word potter said and hastened straight to the school to report to me oh so that is why he wa not prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilet said professor mcgonagall raising her eyebrow what an interesting insight into our justice system blatant corruption roared the portrait of the corpulent rednosed wizard on the wall behind dumbledores desk the ministry did not cut deal with petty criminal in my day no sir they did not thank you fortescue that will do said dumbledore softly the purpose of potter meeting with these student continued professor umbridge wa to persuade them to join an illegal society whose aim wa to learn page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling spell and curse the ministry ha decided are inappropriate for schoolage i think you find you are wrong there dolores said dumbledore quietly peering at her over the half moon spectacle perched halfway down his crooked nose harry stared at him he could not see how dumbledore wa going to talk him out of this one if willy widdershins had indeed heard every word he said in the hog head there wa simply no escaping it oho said fudge bouncing up and down on the ball of his foot again yes do let u hear the latest cockandbull story designed to pull potter out of trouble go on then dumbledore go on willy widdershins wa lying wa he or wa it potter identical twin in the hog head that day or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time a dead man coming back to life and a couple of invisible dementors percy weasley let out a hearty laugh oh very good minister very good harry could have kicked him then he saw to his astonishment that dumbledore wa smiling gently too cornelius i do not deny and nor i am sure doe harry that he wa in the hog head that day nor that he wa trying to recruit student to a defense against the dark art group i am merely pointing out that dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group wa at that time illegal if you remember the ministry decree banning all student society wa not page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling put into effect until two day after harrys hogsmeade meeting so he wa not breaking any rule in the hog head at all percy looked a though he had been struck in the face by something very heavy fudge remained motionless in midbounce his mouth hanging open umbridge recovered first that is all very fine headmaster she said smiling sweetly but we are now nearly six month on from the introduction of educational decree number twentyfour if the first meeting wa not illegal all those that have happened since most certainly are well said dumbledore surveying her with polite interest over the top of his interlocked finger they certainly would be if they had continued after the decree came into effect do you have any evidence that these meeting continued a dumbledore spoke harry heard a rustle behind him and rather thought kingsley whispered something he could have sworn too that he felt something brush against his side a gentle something like a draft or bird wing but looking down he saw nothing there evidence repeated umbridge with that horrible wide toadlike smile have you not been listening dumbledore why do you think miss edgecombe is here oh can she tell u about six month worth of meeting said dumbledore raising his eyebrow i wa under the impression that she wa merely reporting a meeting tonight page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling miss edgecombe said umbridge at once tell u how long these meeting have been going on dear you can simply nod or shake your head i am sure that will not make the spot worse have they been happening regularly over the last six month harry felt a horrible plummeting in his stomach this wa it they had hit a dead end of solid evidence that not even dumbledore would be able to shift aside just nod or shake your head dear umbridge said coaxingly to marietta come on now that will not activate the jinx further everyone in the room wa gazing at the top of mariettas face only her eye were visible between the pulled up robe and her curly fringe perhaps it wa a trick of the firelight but her eye looked oddly blank and then to harrys utter amazement marietta shook her head umbridge looked quickly at fudge and then back at marietta i do not think you understood the question did you dear i am asking whether you have been going to these meeting for the past six month you have have not you again marietta shook her head what do you mean by shaking your head dear said umbridge in a testy voice i would have thought her meaning wa quite clear said professor mcgonagall harshly there have been no secret meeting for the past six month is that correct miss edgecombe page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling marietta nodded but there wa a meeting tonight said umbridge furiously there wa a meeting miss edgecombe you told me about it in the room of requirement and potter wa the leader wa he not potter organized it potter why are you shaking your head girl well usually when a person shake their head said mcgonagall coldly they mean no so unless miss edgecombe is using a form of sign language a yet unknown to human professor umbridge seized marietta pulled her around to face her and began shaking her very hard a split second later dumbledore wa on his foot his wand raised kingsley started forward and umbridge leapt back from marietta waving her hand in the air a though they had been burned i can not allow you to manhandle my student dolores said dumbledore and for the first time he looked angry you want to calm yourself madam umbridge said kingsley in his deep slow voice you do not want to get yourself into trouble now no said umbridge breathlessly glancing up at the towering figure of kingsley i mean yes you are right shacklebolt i i forgot myself marietta wa standing exactly where umbridge had released her she seemed neither perturbed by umbridges sudden attack nor relieved by her release she wa still clutching her robe up to her oddly blank eye staring straight ahead of her a sudden suspicion connected to kingsleys whisper page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and the thing he had felt shoot past him sprang into harrys mind dolores said fudge with the air of trying to settle something once and for all the meeting tonight the one we know definitely happened yes said umbridge pulling herself together yes well miss edgecombe tipped me off and i proceeded at once to the seventh floor accompanied by certain trustworthy student so a to catch those in the meeting redhanded it appears that they were forewarned of my arrival however because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction it doe not matter however i have all their name here miss parkinson ran into the room of requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind we needed evidence and the room provided and to harrys horror she withdrew from her pocket the list of name that had been pinned upon the room of requirement wall and handed it to fudge the moment i saw potter name on the list i knew what we were dealing with she said softly excellent said fudge a smile spreading across his face excellent dolores and by thunder he looked up at dumbledore who wa still standing beside marietta his wand held loosely in his hand see what they have named themselves said fudge quietly dumbledoresarmy dumbledore reached out and took the piece of parchment from fudge he gazed at the heading scribbled by hermione month before and for a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling moment seemed unable to speak then he looked up smiling well the game is up he said simply would you like a written confession from me cornelius or will a statement before these witness suffice harry saw mcgonagall and kingsley look at each other there wa fear in both face he did not understand what wa going on and neither apparently did fudge statement said fudge slowly what i do not dumbledores army cornelius said dumbledore still smiling a he waved the list of name before fudge face not potter army dumbledores army but but understanding blazed suddenly in fudge face he took a horrified step backward yelped and jumped out of the fire again you he whispered stamping again on his smoldering cloak that is right said dumbledore pleasantly you organized this i did said dumbledore you recruited these student for for your army tonight wa supposed to be the first meeting said dumbledore nodding merely to see whether they would be interested in joining me i see now that it wa a mistake to invite miss edgecombe of course page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling marietta nodded fudge looked from her to dumbledore his chest swelling then you have been plotting against me he yelled that is right said dumbledore cheerfully no shouted harry kingsley flashed a look of warning at him mcgonagall widened her eye threateningly but it had suddenly dawned upon harry what dumbledore wa about to do and he could not let it happen no professor dumbledore be quiet harry or i am afraid you will have to leave my office said dumbledore calmly yes shut up potter barked fudge who wa still ogling dumbledore with a kind of horrified delight well well well i came here tonight expecting to expel potter and instead instead you get to arrest me said dumbledore smiling it like losing a knut and finding a galleon is not it weasley cried fudge now positively quivering with delight weasley have you written it all down everything he said his confession have you got it yes sir i think so sir said percy eagerly whose nose wa splattered with ink from the speed of his notetaking the bit about how he been trying to build up an army against the ministry how he been working to destabilize me page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes sir i have got it yes said percy scanning his note joyfully very well then said fudge now radiant with glee duplicate your note weasley and send a copy to the daily prophet at once if we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition percy dashed from the room slamming the door behind him and fudge turned back to dumbledore you will now be escorted back to the ministry where you will be formally charged and then sent to azkaban to await trial ah said dumbledore gently yes yes i thought we might hit that little snag snag said fudge his voice still vibrating with joy i see no snag dumbledore well said dumbledore apologetically i am afraid i do oh really well it just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that i am going to what is the phrase come quietly i am afraid i am not going to come quietly at all cornelius i have absolutely no intention of being sent to azkaban i could break out of course but what a waste of time and frankly i can think of a whole host of thing i would rather be doing umbridges face wa growing steadily redder she looked a though she wa being filled with boiling water fudge stared at dumbledore with a very silly expression on his face a though he had just been stunned by a sudden blow and could not quite believe it had happened he made a small choking noise and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling then looked around at kingsley and the man with short gray hair who alone of everyone in the room had remained entirely silent so far the latter gave fudge a reassuring nod and moved forward a little away from the wall harry saw his hand drift almost casually toward his pocket do not be silly dawlish said dumbledore kindly i am sure you are an excellent auror i seem to remember that you achieved outstanding in all your newt but if you attempt to er bring me in by force i will have to hurt you the man called dawlish blinked looking rather foolish he looked toward fudge again but this time seemed to be hoping for a clue a to what to do next so sneered fudge recovering himself you intend to take on dawlish shacklebolt dolores and myself singlehanded do you dumbledore merlin beard no said dumbledore smiling not unless you are foolish enough to force me to he will not be singlehanded said professor mcgonagall loudly plunging her hand inside her robe oh yes he will minerva said dumbledore sharply hogwarts need you enough of this rubbish said fudge pulling out his own wand dawlish shacklebolt take him a streak of silver light flashed around the room there wa a bang like a gunshot and the floor trembled a hand grabbed the scruff of harrys neck and forced him down on the floor a a second silver flash went off several of the portrait yelled fawkes page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling screeched and a cloud of dust filled the air coughing in the dust harry saw a dark figure fall to the ground with a crash in front of him there wa a shriek and a thud and somebody cried no then the sound of breaking glass frantically scuffling footstep a groan and silence harry struggled around to see who wa half strangling him and saw professor mcgonagall crouched beside him she had forced both him and marietta out of harm way dust wa still floating gently down through the air onto them panting slightly harry saw a very tall figure moving toward them are you all right said dumbledore yes said professor mcgonagall getting up and dragging harry and marietta with her the dust wa clearing the wreckage of the office loomed into view dumbledores desk had been overturned all of the spindly table had been knocked to the floor their silver instrument in piece fudge umbridge kingsley and dawlish lay motionless on the floor fawkes the phoenix soared in wide circle above them singing softly unfortunately i had to hex kingsley too or it would have looked very suspicious said dumbledore in a low voice he wa remarkably quick on the uptake modifying miss edgecombes memory like that while everyone wa looking the other way thank him for me will not you minerva now they will all awake very soon and it will be best if they do not know that we had time to communicate you must act a though no time ha passed a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling though they were merely knocked to the ground they will not remember where will you go dumbledore whispered professor mcgonagall grimmauld place oh no said dumbledore with a grim smile i am not leaving to go into hiding fudge will soon wish he would never dislodged me from hogwarts i promise you professor dumbledore harry began he did not know what to say first how sorry he wa that he had started the da in the first place and caused all this trouble or how terrible he felt that dumbledore wa leaving to save him from expulsion but dumbledore cut him off before he could say another word listen to me harry he said urgently you must study occlumency a hard a you can do you understand me do everything professor snape tell you and practice it particularly every night before sleeping so that you can close your mind to bad dream you will understand why soon enough but you must promise me the man called dawlish wa stirring dumbledore seized harrys wrist remember close your mind but a dumbledore s finger closed over harrys skin a pain shot through the scar on his forehead and he felt again that terrible snakelike longing to strike dumbledore to bite him to hurt him you will understand whispered dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fawkes circled the office and swooped low over him dumbledore released harry raised his hand and grasped the phoenix long golden tail there wa a flash of fire and the pair of them had gone where is he yelled fudge pushing himself up from the ground where is he i do not know shouted kingsley also leaping to his foot well he can not have disapparated cried umbridge you can not inside this school the stair cried dawlish and he flung himself upon the door wrenched it open and disappeared followed closely by kingsley and umbridge fudge hesitated then got to his foot slowly brushing dust from his front there wa a long and painful silence well minerva said fudge nastily straightening his torn shirtsleeve i am afraid this is the end of your friend dumbledore you think so do you said professor mcgonagall scornfully fudge seemed not to hear her he wa looking around at the wrecked office a few of the portrait hissed at him one or two even made rude hand gesture you would better get those two off to bed said fudge looking back at professor mcgonagall with a dismissive nod toward harry and marietta she said nothing but marched harry and marietta to the door a it swung closed behind them harry heard phineas nigelluss voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you know minister i disagree with dumbledore on many count but you can not deny he got style page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling snapes worst memory by order of the ministry of magic dolores jane umbridge high inquisitor ha replaced albus dumbledore a head of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the above is in accordance with educational decree number twentyeight signed cornelius oswald fudge minister of magic the notice had gone up all over the school overnight but they did not explain how every single person within the castle seemed to know that dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling had overcome two aurors the high inquisitor the minister of magic and his junior assistant to escape no matter where harry went within the castle next day the sole topic of conversation wa dumbledores flight and though some of the detail might have gone awry in the retelling harry overheard one secondyear girl assuring another that fudge wa now lying in st mungos with a pumpkin for a head it wa surprising how accurate the rest of their information wa everybody seemed aware for instance that harry and marietta were the only student to have witnessed the scene in dumbledores office and a marietta wa now in the hospital wing harry found himself besieged with request to give a firsthand account wherever he went dumbledore will be back before long said ernie macmillan confidently on the way back from herbology after listening intently to harrys story they could not keep him away in our second year and they will not be able to this time the fat friar told me he dropped his voice conspiratorially so that harry ron and hermione had to lean closer to him to hear that umbridge tried to get back into his office last night after they would searched the castle and ground for him could not get past the gargoyle the head office ha sealed itself against her ernie smirked apparently she had a right little tantrum oh i expect she really fancied herself sitting up there in the head office said hermione viciously a they walked up the stone step into the entrance hall lording it over all the other teacher the stupid puffedup powercrazy old now do you really want to finish that sentence granger page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling draco malfoy had slid out from behind the door followed by crabbe and goyle his pale pointed face wa alight with malice afraid i am going to have to dock a few point from gryffindor and hufflepuff he drawled it only teacher that can dock point from house malfoy said ernie at once yeah were prefect too remember snarled ron i know prefect can not dock point weasel king sneered malfoy crabbe and goyle sniggered but member of the inquisitorial squad the what said hermione sharply the inquisitorial squad granger said malfoy pointing toward a tiny silver i upon his robe just beneath his prefect badge a select group of student who are supportive of the ministry of magic handpicked by professor umbridge anyway member of the inquisitorial squad do have the power to dock point so granger ill have five from you for being rude about our new headmistress macmillan five for contradicting me five because i do not like you potter weasley your shirt untucked so ill have another five for that oh yeah i forgot you are a mudblood granger so ten for that ron pulled out his wand but hermione pushed it away whispering do not wise move granger breathed malfoy new head new time be good now potty weasel king page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he strode away laughing heartily with crabbe and goyle he wa bluffing said ernie looking appalled he can not be allowed to dock point that would be ridiculous it would completely undermine the prefect system but harry ron and hermione had turned automatically toward the giant hourglass set in niche along the wall behind them which recorded the house point gryffindor and ravenclaw had been neck and neck in the lead that morning even a they watched stone flew upward reducing the amount in the lower bulb in fact the only glass that seemed unchanged wa the emeraldfilled one of slytherin noticed have you said freds voice he and george had just come down the marble staircase and joined harry ron hermione and ernie in front of the hourglass malfoy just docked u all about fifty point said harry furiously a they watched several more stone fly upward from the gryffindor hourglass yeah montague tried to do u during break said george what do you mean tried said ron quickly he never managed to get all the word out said fred due to the fact that we forced him headfirst into that vanishing cabinet on the first floor hermione looked very shocked but you will get into terrible trouble page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling not until montague reappears and that could take week i do not know where we sent him said fred coolly anyway we have decided we do not care about getting into trouble anymore have you ever asked hermione course we have said george never been expelled have we we have always known where to draw the line said fred we might have put a toe across it occasionally said george but we have always stopped short of causing real mayhem said fred but now said ron tentatively well now said george what with dumbledore gone said fred we reckon a bit of mayhem said george is exactly what our dear new head deserves said fred you must not whispered hermione you really must not she would love a reason to expel you you do not get it hermione do you said fred smiling at her we do not care about staying anymore wed walk out right now if we were not determined to do our bit for dumbledore first so anyway he checked his watch phase one is about to begin id get in the great hall for lunch if i were you that way page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the teacher will see you can not have had anything to do with it anything to do with what said hermione anxiously you will see said george run along now fred and george turned away and disappeared in the swelling crowd descending the stair toward lunch looking highly disconcerted ernie muttered something about unfinished transfiguration homework and scurried away i think we should get out of here you know said hermione nervously just in case yeah all right said ron and the three of them moved toward the door to the great hall but harry had barely glimpsed today ceiling of scudding white cloud when somebody tapped him on the shoulder and turning he found himself almost nose to nose with filch the caretaker he took several hasty step backward filch wa best viewed at a distance the headmistress would like to see you potter he leered i did not do it said harry stupidly thinking of whatever fred and george were planning filchs jowl wobbled with silent laughter guilty conscience eh he wheezed follow me harry glanced back at ron and hermione who were both looking worried he shrugged and followed filch back into the entrance hall against the tide of hungry student page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling filch seemed to be in an extremely good mood he hummed creakily under his breath a they climbed the marble staircase a they reached the first landing he said thing are changing around here potter i have noticed said harry coldly yerse i have been telling dumbledore for year and year he too soft with you all said filch chuckling nastily you filthy little beast would never have dropped stinkpellets if you would known i had it in my power to whip you raw would you now nobody would have thought of throwing fanged frisbee down the corridor if i could have strung you up by the ankle in my office would they but when educational decree twentynine come in potter ill be allowed to do them thing and she is asked the minister to sign an order for the expulsion of peeve oh thing are going to be very different around here with her in charge umbridge had obviously gone to some length to get filch on her side harry thought and the worst of it wa that he would probably prove an important weapon his knowledge of the school secret passageway and hiding place wa probably second only to the weasley twin here we are he said leering down at harry a he rapped three time upon professor umbridges door and pushed it open the potter boy to see you madam umbridges office so very familiar to harry from his many detention wa the same a usual except for the large wooden block lying across the front of her desk on which golden letter spelled the word headmistress also his firebolt and freds and george cleansweeps which he saw with a pang page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling were now chained and padlocked to a stout iron peg in the wall behind the desk umbridge wa sitting behind the desk busily scribbling upon some of her pink parchment but looked up and smiled widely at their entrance thank you argus she said sweetly not at all madam not at all said filch bowing a low a his rheumatism would permit and exiting backward sit said umbridge curtly pointing toward a chair and harry sat she continued to scribble for a few moment he watched some of the foul kitten gamboling around the plate over her head wondering what fresh horror she had in store for him well now she said finally setting down her quill and looking like a toad about to swallow a particularly juicy fly what would you like to drink what said harry quite sure he had misheard her to drink mr potter she said smiling still more widely tea coffee pumpkin juice a she named each drink she gave her short wand a wave and a cup or glass of it appeared upon her desk nothing thank you said harry i wish you to have a drink with me she said her voice becoming more dangerously sweet choose one fine tea then said harry shrugging page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she got up and made quite a performance of adding milk with her back to him she then bustled around the desk with it smiling in sinisterly sweet fashion there she said handing it to him drink it before it get cold will not you well now mr potter i thought we ought to have a little chat after the distressing event of last night he said nothing she settled herself back into her seat and waited when several long moment had passed in silence she said gaily you are not drinking up he raised the cup to his lip and then just a suddenly lowered it one of the horrible painted kitten behind umbridge had great round blue eye just like madeye moody magical one and it had just occurred to harry what madeye would say if he ever heard that harry had drunk anything offered by a known enemy what is the matter said umbridge who wa still watching him do you want sugar no said harry he raised the cup to his lip again and pretended to take a sip though keeping his mouth tightly closed umbridges smile widened good she whispered very good now then she leaned forward a little where is albus dumbledore no idea said harry promptly drink up drink up she said still smiling now mr potter let u not play childish game i know that you know where he ha gone you and dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling have been in this together from the beginning consider your position mr potter i do not know where he is harry pretended to drink again very well said umbridge looking displeased in that case you will kindly tell me the whereabouts of sirius black harrys stomach turned over and his hand holding the teacup shook so that the cup rattled in it saucer he tilted the cup to his mouth with his lip pressed together so that some of the hot liquid trickled down onto his robe i do not know he said a little too quickly mr potter said umbridge let me remind you that it wa i who almost caught the criminal black in the gryffindor fire in october i know perfectly well it wa you he wa meeting and if i had had any proof neither of you would be at large today i promise you i repeat mr potter where is sirius black no idea said harry loudly have not got a clue they stared at each other so long that harry felt his eye watering then she stood up very well potter i will take your word for it this time but be warned the might of the ministry stand behind me all channel of communication in and out of this school are being monitored a floo network regulator is keeping watch over every fire in hogwarts except my own of course my inquisitorial squad is opening and reading all owl post entering and leaving the castle and mr filch is observing all page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling secret passage in and out of the castle if i find a shred of evidence boom the very floor of the office shook umbridge slipped sideways clutching her desk for support looking shocked what wa she wa gazing toward the door harry took the opportunity to empty his almost full cup of tea into the nearest vase of dried flower he could hear people running and screaming several floor below back to lunch with you potter cried umbridge raising her wand and dashing out of the office harry gave her a few second start then hurried after her to see what the source of all the uproar wa it wa not difficult to find one floor down pandemonium reigned somebody and harry had a very shrewd idea who had set off what seemed to be an enormous crate of enchanted firework dragon comprised entirely of greenandgold spark were soaring up and down the corridor emitting loud fiery blast and bang a they went shocking pink catherine wheel five foot in diameter were whizzing lethally through the air like so many flying saucer rocket with long tail of brilliant silver star were ricocheting off the wall sparkler were writing swearword in midair of their own accord firecracker were exploding like mine everywhere harry looked and instead of burning themselves out fading from sight or fizzling to a halt these pyrotechnical miracle seemed to be gaining in energy and momentum the longer he watched page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling filch and umbridge were standing apparently transfixed with horror halfway down the stair a harry watched one of the larger catherine wheel seemed to decide that what it needed wa more room to maneuver it whirled toward umbridge and filch with a sinister voheeeeeeeeee both adult yelled with fright and ducked and it soared straight out of the window behind them and off across the ground meanwhile several of the dragon and a large purple bat that wa smoking ominously took advantage of the open door at the end of the corridor to escape toward the second floor hurry filch hurry shrieked umbridge they will be all over the school unless we do something stupefy a jet of red light shot out of the end of her wand and hit one of the rocket instead of freezing in midair it exploded with such force that it blasted a hole in a painting of a soppylooking witch in the middle of a meadow she ran for it just in time reappearing second later squashed into the painting next door where a couple of wizard playing card stood up hastily to make room for her do not stun them filch shouted umbridge angrily for all the world a though it had been his suggestion right you are headmistress wheezed filch who wa a squib and could no more have stunned the firework than swallowed them he dashed to a nearby cupboard pulled out a broom and began swatting at the firework in midair within second the head of the broom wa ablaze harry had seen enough laughing he ducked down low ran to a door he knew wa concealed behind a tapestry a little way along the corridor and slipped page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling through it to find fred and george hiding just behind it listening to umbridges and filchs yell and quaking with suppressed mirth impressive harry said quietly grinning very impressive you will put dr filibuster out of business no problem cheer whispered george wiping tear of laughter from his face oh i hope she try vanishing them next they multiply by ten every time you try the firework continued to burn and to spread all over the school that afternoon though they caused plenty of disruption particularly the firecracker the other teacher did not seem to mind them very much dear dear said professor mcgonagall sardonically a one of the dragon soared around her classroom emitting loud bang and exhaling flame miss brown would you mind running along to the headmistress and informing her that we have an escaped firework in our classroom the upshot of it all wa that professor umbridge spent her first afternoon a headmistress running all over the school answering the summons of the other teacher none of whom seemed able to rid their room of the firework without her when the final bell rang and the student were heading back to gryffindor tower with their bag harry saw with immense satisfaction a disheveled and soot blackened umbridge tottering sweatyfaced from professor flitwicks classroom thank you so much professor said professor flitwick in his squeaky little voice i could have got rid of the sparkler myself of course but i wa not sure whether i had the authority page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling beaming he closed his classroom door in her snarling face fred and george were hero that night in the gryffindor common room even hermione fought her way through the excited crowd around them to congratulate them they were wonderful firework she said admiringly thanks said george looking both surprised and pleased weasleys wildfire whizbang only thing is we used our whole stock were going to have to start again from scratch now it wa worth it though said fred who wa taking order from clamoring gryffindors if you want to add your name to the waiting list hermione it five galleon for your basic blaze box and twenty for the deflagration deluxe hermione returned to the table where harry and ron were sitting staring at their schoolbag a though hoping their homework might spring out of it and start doing itself oh why do not we have a night off said hermione brightly a a silvertailed weasley rocket zoomed past the window after all the easter holiday start on friday well have plenty of time then are you feeling all right ron asked staring at her in disbelief now you mention it said hermione happily dyou know i think i am feeling a bit rebellious harry could still hear the distant bang of escaped firecracker when he and ron went up to bed an hour page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling later and a he got undressed a sparkler floated past the tower still resolutely spelling out the word poo he got into bed yawning with his glass off the occasional firework still passing the window became blurred looking like sparkling cloud beautiful and mysterious against the black sky he turned onto his side wondering how umbridge wa feeling about her first day in dumbledores job and how fudge would react when he heard that the school had spent most of the day in a state of advanced disruption smiling to himself he closed his eye the whizz and bang of escaped firework in the ground seemed to be growing more distant or perhaps he harry wa simply speeding away from them he had fallen right into the corridor leading to the department of mystery he wa speeding toward the plain black door let it open let it open it did he wa inside the circular room lined with door he crossed it placed his hand upon an identical door and it swung inward now he wa in a long rectangular room full of an odd mechanical clicking there were dancing fleck of light on the wall but he did not pause to investigate he had to go on there wa a door at the far end it too opened at his touch and now he wa in a dimly lit room a high and wide a a church full of nothing but row and row of towering shelf each laden with small dusty spun glass sphere now harrys heart wa beating fast with excitement he knew where to go he ran page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling forward but his footstep made no noise in the enormous deserted room there wa something in this room he wanted very very much something he wanted or somebody else wanted his scar wa hurting bang harry awoke instantly confused and angry the dark dormitory wa full of the sound of laughter cool said seamus who wa silhouetted against the window i think one of those catherine wheel hit a rocket and it like they mated come and see harry heard ron and dean scramble out of bed for a better look he lay quite still and silent while the pain in his scar subsided and disappointment washed over him he felt a though a wonderful treat had been snatched from him at the very last moment he had got so close that time glittering pinkandsilver winged piglet were now soaring past the window of gryffindor tower harry lay and listened to the appreciative whoop of gryffindors in the dormitory below them his stomach gave a sickening jolt a he remembered that he had occlumency the following evening harry spent the whole of the next day dreading what snape wa going to say if he found out how much farther into the department of mystery he had penetrated during his last dream with a surge of guilt he realized that he had not practiced occlumency once since their last lesson there had page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling been too much going on since dumbledore had left he wa sure he would not have been able to empty his mind even if he had tried he doubted however whether snape would accept that excuse he attempted a little lastminute practice during class that day but it wa no good hermione kept asking him what wa wrong whenever he fell silent trying to rid himself of all thought and emotion and after all the best moment to empty his brain wa not while teacher were firing review question at the class resigned to the worst he set off for snape s office after dinner halfway across the entrance hall however cho came hurrying up to him over here said harry glad of a reason to postpone his meeting with snape and beckoning her across to the corner of the entrance hall where the giant hourglass stood gryffindors wa now almost empty are you okay umbridge ha not been asking you about the da ha she oh no said cho hurriedly no it wa only well i just wanted to say harry i never dreamed marietta would tell yeah well said harry moodily he did feel cho might have chosen her friend a bit more carefully it wa small consolation that the last he had heard marietta wa still up in the hospital wing and madam pomfrey had not been able to make the slightest improvement to her pimple she is a lovely person really said cho she just made a mistake harry looked at her incredulously page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a lovely person who made a mistake she sold u all out including you well we all got away did not we said cho pleadingly you know her mum work for the ministry it really difficult for her ron dad work for the ministry too harry said furiously and in case you had not noticed he ha not got sneak written across his face that wa a really horrible trick of hermione granger said cho fiercely she should have told u she would jinxed that list i think it wa a brilliant idea said harry coldly cho flushed and her eye grew brighter oh yes i forgot of course if it wa darling hermiones idea do not start cry again said harry warningly i wa not going to she shouted yeah well good he said i have got enough to cope with at the moment go and cope with it then she said furiously turning on her heel and stalking off fuming harry descended the stair to snapes dungeon and though he knew from experience how much easier it would be for snape to penetrate his mind if he arrived angry and resentful he succeeded in nothing but thinking of a few more good thing he should have said to cho about marietta before reaching the dungeon door page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you are late potter said snape coldly a harry closed the door behind him snape wa standing with his back to harry removing a usual certain of his thought and placing them carefully in dumbledores pensieve he dropped the last silvery strand into the stone basin and turned to face harry so he said have you been practicing yes harry lied looking carefully at one of the leg of snapes desk well well soon find out will not we said snape smoothly wand out potter harry moved into his usual position facing snape with the desk between them his heart wa pumping fast with anger at cho and anxiety about how much snape wa about to extract from his mind on the count of three then said snape lazily one two snapes office door banged open and draco malfoy sped in professor snape sir oh sorry malfoy wa looking at snape and harry in some surprise it all right draco said snape lowering his wand potter is here for a little remedial potion harry had not seen malfoy look so gleeful since umbridge had turned up to inspect hagrid page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i did not know he said leering at harry who knew his face wa burning he would have given a great deal to be able to shout the truth at malfoy or even better to hit him with a good curse well draco what is it asked snape it professor umbridge sir she need your help said malfoy they have found montague sir he turned up jammed inside a toilet on the fourth floor how did he get in there demanded snape i do not know sir he a bit confused very well very well potter said snape we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening instead he turned and swept from his office malfoy mouthed remedial potion at harry behind snape s back before following him seething harry replaced his wand inside his robe and made to leave the room at least he had twenty four more hour in which to practice he knew he ought to feel grateful for the narrow escape though it wa hard that it came at the expense of malfoy telling the whole school that he needed remedial potion he wa at the office door when he saw it a patch of shivering light dancing on the door frame he stopped looking at it reminded of something then he remembered it wa a little like the light he had seen in his dream last night the light in the second room he had walked through on his journey through the department of mystery he turned around the light wa coming from the pensieve sitting on snape s desk the silver white page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling content were ebbing and swirling within snapes thought thing he did not want harry to see if he broke through snapes defense accidentally harry gazed at the pensieve curiosity welling inside him what wa it that snape wa so keen to hide from harry the silvery light shivered on the wall harry took two step toward the desk thinking hard could it possibly be information about the department of mystery that snape wa determined to keep from him harry looked over his shoulder his heart now pumping harder and faster than ever how long would it take snape to release montague from the toilet would he come straight back to his office afterward or accompany montague to the hospital wing surely the latter montague wa captain of the slytherin quidditch team snape would want to make sure he wa all right harry walked the remaining few foot to the pensieve and stood over it gazing into it depth he hesitated listening then pulled out his wand again the office and the corridor beyond were completely silent he gave the content of the pensieve a small prod with the end of his wand the silvery stuff within began to swirl very fast harry leaned forward over it and saw that it had become transparent he wa once again looking down into a room a though through a circular window in the ceiling in fact unless he wa much mistaken he wa looking down upon the great hall his breath wa actually fogging the surface of snapes thought his brain seemed to be in limbo it would page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling be insane to do the thing that he wa so strongly tempted to do he wa trembling snape could be back at any moment but harry thought of chos anger of malfoys jeering face and a reckless daring seized him he took a great gulp of breath and plunged his face into the surface of snapes thought at once the floor of the office lurched tipping harry headfirst into the pensieve he wa falling through cold blackness spinning furiously a he went and then he wa standing in the middle of the great hall but the four house table were gone instead there were more than a hundred smaller table all facing the same way at each of which sat a student head bent low scribbling on a roll of parchment the only sound wa the scratching of quill and the occasional rustle a somebody adjusted their parchment it wa clearly exam time sunshine wa streaming through the high window onto the bent head which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light harry looked around carefully snape had to be here somewhere this wa his memory and there he wa at a table right behind harry harry stared snapetheteenager had a stringy pallid look about him like a plant kept in the dark his hair wa lank and greasy and wa flopping onto the table his hooked nose barely half an inch from the surface of the parchment a he scribbled harry moved around behind snape and read the heading of the examination paper defense against the dark art page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ordinary wizarding level so snape had to be fifteen or sixteen around harrys own age his hand wa flying across the parchment he had written at least a foot more than his closest neighbor and yet his writing wa minuscule and cramped five more minute the voice made harry jump turning he saw the top of professor flitwicks head moving between the desk a short distance away professor flitwick wa walking past a boy with untidy black hair very untidy black hair harry moved so quickly that had he been solid he would have knocked desk flying instead he seemed to slide dreamlike across two aisle and up a third the back of the blackhaired boy head drew nearer and nearer he wa straightening up now putting down his quill pulling his roll of parchment toward him so a to reread what he had written harry stopped in front of the desk and gazed down at his fifteenyear old father excitement exploded in the pit of his stomach it wa a though he wa looking at himself but with deliberate mistake james eye were hazel his nose wa slightly longer than harrys and there wa no scar on his forehead but they had the same thin face same mouth same eyebrow james hair stuck up at the back exactly a harrys did his hand could have been harrys and harry could tell that when james stood up they would be within an inch of each others height page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling james yawned hugely and rumpled up his hair making it even messier than it had been then with a glance toward professor flitwick he turned in his seat and grinned at a boy sitting four seat behind him with another shock of excitement harry saw sirius give james the thumbsup sirius wa lounging in his chair at his ease tilting it back on two leg he wa very goodlooking his dark hair fell into his eye with a sort of casual elegance neither james nor harrys could ever have achieved and a girl sitting behind him wa eyeing him hopefully though he did not seem to have noticed and two seat along from this girl harrys stomach gave another pleasurable squirm wa remus lupin he looked rather pale and peaky wa the full moon approaching and wa absorbed in the exam a he reread his answer he scratched his chin with the end of his quill frowning slightly so that meant wormtail had to be around here somewhere too and sure enough harry spotted him within second a small mousyhaired boy with a pointed nose wormtail looked anxious he wa chewing his fingernail staring down at his paper scuffing the ground with his toe every now and then he glanced hopefully at his neighbor paper harry stared at wormtail for a moment then back at james who wa now doodling on a bit of scrap parchment he had drawn a snitch and wa now tracing the letter l e what did they stand for quill down please squeaked professor flitwick that mean you too stebbins please remain seated while i collect your parchment acciol more than a hundred roll of parchment zoomed into the air and into professor flitwicks outstretched arm knocking him backward off his foot several page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling people laughed a couple of student at the front desk got up took hold of professor flitwick beneath the elbow and lifted him onto his foot again thank you thank you panted professor flitwick very well everybody you are free to go harry looked down at his father who had hastily crossed out the l e he had been embellishing jumped to his foot stuffed his quill and the exam question paper into his bag which he slung over his back and stood waiting for sirius to join him harry looked around and glimpsed snape a short way away moving between the table toward the door into the entrance hall still absorbed in his own examination paper roundshouldered yet angular he walked in a twitchy manner that recalled a spider his oily hair swinging about his face a gang of chattering girl separated snape from james and sirius and by planting himself in the midst of this group harry managed to keep snape in sight while straining his ear to catch the voice of james and his friend did you like question ten moony asked sirius a they emerged into the entrance hall loved it said lupin briskly give five sign that identify the werewolf excellent question dyou think you managed to get all the sign said james in tone of mock concern think i did said lupin seriously a they joined the crowd thronging around the front door eager to get out into the sunlit ground one he sitting on my page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling chair two he wearing my clothes three his name remus lupin wormtail wa the only one who did not laugh i got the snout shape the pupil of the eye and the tufted tail he said anxiously but i could not think what else how thick are you wormtail said james impatiently you run round with a werewolf once a month keep your voice down implored lupin harry looked anxiously behind him again snape remained close by still buried in his examination question but this wa snapes memory and harry wa sure that if snape chose to wander off in a different direction once outside in the ground he harry would not be able to follow james any farther to his intense relief however when james and his three friend strode off down the lawn toward the lake snape followed still poring over the paper and apparently with no fixed idea of where he wa going by jogging a little ahead of him harry managed to maintain a close watch on james and the others well i thought that paper wa a piece of cake he heard sirius say ill be surprised if i do not get outstanding on it at least me too said james he put his hand in his pocket and took out a struggling golden snitch where d you get that nicked it said james casually he started playing with the snitch allowing it to fly a much a a foot page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling away and seizing it again his reflex were excellent wormtail watched him in awe they stopped in the shade of the very same beech tree on the edge of the lake where harry ron and hermione had spent a sunday finishing their homework and threw themselves down on the grass harry looked over his shoulder yet again and saw to his delight that snape had settled himself on the grass in the dense shadow of a clump of bush he wa a deeply immersed in the owl paper a ever which left harry free to sit down on the grass between the beech and the bush and watch the foursome under the tree the sunlight wa dazzling on the smooth surface of the lake on the bank of which the group of laughing girl who had just left the great hall were sitting with shoe and sock off cooling their foot in the water lupin had pulled out a book and wa reading sirius stared around at the student milling over the grass looking rather haughty and bored but very handsomely so james wa still playing with the snitch letting it zoom farther and farther away almost escaping but always grabbed at the last second wormtail wa watching him with his mouth open every time james made a particularly difficult catch wormtail gasped and applauded after five minute of this harry wondered why james did not tell wormtail to get a grip on himself but james seemed to be enjoying the attention harry noticed his father had a habit of rumpling up his hair a though to make sure it did not get too tidy and also that he kept looking over at the girl by the water edge put that away will you said sirius finally a james made a fine catch and wormtail let out a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling cheer before wormtail wet himself from excitement wormtail turned slightly pink but james grinned if it bother you he said stuffing the snitch back in his pocket harry had the distinct impression that sirius wa the only one for whom james would have stopped showing off i am bored said sirius wish it wa full moon you might said lupin darkly from behind his book we have still got transfiguration if you are bored you could test me here he held out his book sirius snorted i do not need to look at that rubbish i know it all this will liven you up padfoot said james quietly look who it is sirius head turned he had become very still like a dog that ha scented a rabbit excellent he said softly snivellus harry turned to see what sirius wa looking at snape wa on his foot again and wa stowing the owl paper in his bag a he emerged from the shadow of the bush and set off across the grass sirius and james stood up lupin and wormtail remained sitting lupin wa still staring down at his book though his eye were not moving and a faint frown line had appeared between his eyebrow wormtail wa looking from sirius and james to snape with a look of avid anticipation on his face page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling all right snivellus said james loudly snape reacted so fast it wa a though he had been expecting an attack dropping his bag he plunged his hand inside his robe and his wand wa halfway into the air when james shouted expelliarmusv snape s wand flew twelve foot into the air and fell with a little thud in the grass behind him sirius let out a bark of laughter impedimental he said pointing his wand at snape who wa knocked off his foot halfway through a dive toward his own fallen wand student all around had turned to watch some of them had gotten to their foot and were edging nearer to watch some looked apprehensive others entertained snape lay panting on the ground james and sirius advanced on him wand up james glancing over his shoulder at the girl at the water edge a he went wormtail wa on his foot now watching hungrily edging around lupin to get a clearer view how did the exam go snivelly said james i wa watching him his nose wa touching the parchment said sirius viciously there will be great grease mark all over it they will not be able to read a word several people watching laughed snape wa clearly unpopular wormtail sniggered shrilly snape wa trying to get up but the jinx wa still operating on him he wa struggling a though bound by invisible rope page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you wait he panted staring up at james with an expression of purest loathing you wait wait for what said sirius coolly what are you going to do snivelly wipe your nose on u snape let out a stream of mixed swearword and hex but his wand being ten foot away nothing happened wash out your mouth said james coldly scourgifyl pink soap bubble streamed from snapes mouth at once the froth wa covering his lip making him gag choking him leave him alone james and sirius looked around james free hand jumped to his hair again it wa one of the girl from the lake edge she had thick dark red hair that fell to her shoulder and startlingly green almondshaped eye harrys eye harrys mother all right evans said james and the tone of his voice wa suddenly pleasant deeper more mature leave him alone lily repeated she wa looking at james with every sign of great dislike what is he done to you well said james appearing to deliberate the point it more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling many of the surrounding watcher laughed sirius and wormtail included but lupin still apparently intent on his book did not and neither did lily you think you are funny she said coldly but you are just an arrogant bullying toerag potter leave him alone i will if you go out with me evans said james quickly go on go out with me and ill never lay a wand on old snivelly again behind him the impediment jinx wa wearing off snape wa beginning to inch toward his fallen wand spitting out soapsuds a he crawled i would not go out with you if it wa a choice between you and the giant squid said lily bad luck prong said sirius briskly turning back to snape oy but too late snape had directed his wand straight at james there wa a flash of light and a gash appeared on the side of james face spattering his robe with blood james whirled about a second flash of light later snape wa hanging upside down in the air his robe falling over his head to reveal skinny pallid leg and a pair of graying underpants many people in the small crowd watching cheered sirius james and wormtail roared with laughter lily whose furious expression had twitched for an instant a though she wa going to smile said let him down certainly said james and he jerked his wand upward snape fell into a crumpled heap on the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ground disentangling himself from his robe he got quickly to his foot wand up but sirius said petrificus totalusl and snape keeled over again at once rigid a a board leave him alone lily shouted she had her own wand out now james and sirius eyed it warily ah evans do not make me hex you said james earnestly take the curse off him then james sighed deeply then turned to snape and muttered the countercurse there you go he said a snape struggled to his foot again you are lucky evans wa here snivellus i do not need help from filthy little mudbloods like her lily blinked fine she said coolly i will not bother in future and id wash your pant if i were you snivellus apologize to evans james roared at snape his wand pointed threateningly at him i do not want you to make him apologize lily shouted rounding on james you are a bad a he is what yelped james id never call you a you knowwhat messing up your hair because you think it look cool to look like you have just got off your broomstick showing off with that stupid snitch walking down page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling corridor and hexing anyone who annoys you just because you can i am surprised your broomstick can get off the ground with that fat head on it you make me sick she turned on her heel and hurried away evans james shouted after her hey evans but she did not look back what is it with her said james trying and failing to look a though this wa a throwaway question of no real importance to him reading between the line id say she think you are a bit conceited mate said sirius right said james who looked furious now right there wa another flash of light and snape wa once again hanging upside down in the air who want to see me take off snivellys pant but whether james really did take off snapes pant harry never found out a hand had closed tight over his upper arm closed with a pincerlike grip wincing harry looked around to see who had hold of him and saw with a thrill of horror a fully grown adultsized snape standing right beside him white with rage having fun harry felt himself rising into the air the summer day evaporated around him he wa floating upward through icy blackness snapes hand still tight upon his upper arm then with a swooping feeling a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling though he had turned head over heel in midair his foot hit the stone floor of snapes dungeon and he wa standing again beside the pensieve on snapes desk in the shadowy presentday potion master study so said snape gripping harrys arm so tightly harrys hand wa starting to feel numb so been enjoying yourself potter nno said harry trying to free his arm it wa scary snapes lip were shaking his face wa white his teeth were bared amusing man your father wa not he said snape shaking harry so hard that his glass slipped down his nose i did not snape threw harry from him with all his might harry fell hard onto the dungeon floor you will not tell anybody what you saw snape bellowed no said harry getting to his foot a far from snape a he could no of course i w get out get out i do not want to see you in this office ever again and a harry hurtled toward the door ajar of dead cockroach exploded over his head he wrenched the door open and flew away up the corridor stopping only when he had put three floor between himself and snape there he leaned against the wall panting and rubbing his bruised arm page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he had no desire at all to return to gryffindor tower so early nor to tell ron and hermione what he had just seen what wa making harry feel so horrified and unhappy wa not being shouted at or having jar thrown at him it wa that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlooker knew exactly how snape had felt a his father had taunted him and that judging from what he had just seen his father had been every bit a arrogant a snape had always told him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling career advice but why have not you got occlumency lesson anymore said hermione frowning i have told you harry muttered snape reckons i can carry on by myself now i have got the basic so you have stopped having funny dream said hermione skeptically pretty much said harry not looking at her well i do not think snape should stop until you are absolutely sure you can control them said hermione indignantly harry i think you should go back to him and ask no said harry forcefully just drop it hermione okay it wa the first day of the easter holiday and hermione a wa her custom had spent a large part of the day drawing up study schedule for the three of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling them harry and ron had let her do it it wa easier than arguing with her and in any case they might come in useful ron had been startled to discover that there were only six week left until their exam how can that come a a shock hermione demanded a she tapped each little square on ron schedule with her wand so that it flashed a different color according to it subject i do not know said ron there is been a lot going on well there you are she said handing him his schedule if you follow that you should do fine ron looked down it gloomily but then brightened you have given me an evening off every week that is for quidditch practice said hermione the smile faded from ron face what is the point he said we have got about a much chance of winning the quidditch cup this year a dad got of becoming minister of magic hermione said nothing she wa looking at harry who wa staring blankly at the opposite wall of the common room while crookshanks pawed at his hand trying to get his ear scratched what is wrong harry what he said quickly nothing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he seized his copy of defensive magical theory and pretended to be looking something up in the index crookshanks gave him up a a bad job and slunk away under hermiones chair i saw cho earlier said hermione tentatively and she looked really miserable too have you two had a row again wha oh yeah we have said harry seizing gratefully on the excuse what about that sneak friend of hers marietta said harry yeah well i do not blame you said ron angrily setting down his study schedule if it had not been for her ron went into a rant about marietta edgecombe which harry found helpful all he had to do wa look angry nod and say yeah and that is right whenever ron drew breath leaving his mind free to dwell ever more miserably on what he had seen in the pensieve he felt a though the memory of it wa eating him from inside he had been so sure that his parent had been wonderful people that he never had the slightest difficulty in disbelieving snapes aspersion on his father character had not people like hagrid and sirius told harry how wonderful his father had been yeah well look what sirius wa like himself said a nagging voice inside harrys head he wa a bad wa not he yes he had once overheard professor mcgonagall saying that his father and sirius had been troublemaker at school but she had described them a forerunner of the weasley twin and harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling could not imagine fred and george dangling someone upside down for the fun of it not unless they really loathed them perhaps malfoy or somebody who really deserved it harry tried to make a case for snape having deserved what he had suffered at james hand but had not lily asked what is he done to you and had not james replied it more the fact that he exists if you know what i mean had not james started it all simply because sirius said he wa bored harry remembered lupin saying back in grimmauld place that dumbledore had made him prefect in the hope that he would be able to exercise some control over james and sirius but in the pensieve he had sat there and let it all happen harry reminded himself that lily had intervened his mother had been decent yet the memory of the look on her face a she had shouted at james disturbed him quite a much a anything else she had clearly loathed james and harry simply could not understand how they could have ended up married once or twice he even wondered whether james had forced her into it for nearly five year the thought of his father had been a source of comfort of inspiration whenever someone had told him he wa like james he had glowed with pride inside and now now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him the weather grew breezier brighter and warmer a the holiday passed but harry wa stuck with the rest of the fifth and seventh year who were all trapped inside traipsing back and forth to the library harry pretended that his bad mood had no other because but the approaching exam and a his fellow page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling gryffindors were sick of studying themselves his excuse went unchallenged harry i am talking to you can you hear me huh he looked around ginny weasley looking very windswept had joined him at the library table where he had been sitting alone it wa late on sunday evening hermione had gone back to gryffindor tower to review ancient rune ron had quidditch practice oh hi said harry pulling his book back toward him how come you are not at practice it over said ginny ron had to take jack sloper up to the hospital wing why well were not sure but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat she sighed heavily anyway a package just arrived it only just got through umbridges new screening process she hoisted a box wrapped in brown paper onto the table it had clearly been unwrapped and carelessly rewrapped and there wa a scribbled note across it in red ink reading inspected and passed by the hogwarts high inquisitor it easter egg from mum said ginny there is one for you there you go she handed him a handsome chocolate egg decorated with small iced snitch and according to the packaging containing a bag of fizzing whizbees page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry looked at it for a moment then to his horror felt a hard lump rise in his throat are you okay harry asked ginny quietly yeah i am fine said harry gruffly the lump in his throat wa painful he did not understand why an easter egg should have made him feel like this you seem really down lately ginny persisted you know i am sure if you just talked to cho it not cho i want to talk to said harry brusquely who is it then asked ginny he glanced around to make quite sure that nobody wa listening madam pince wa several shelf away stamping out a pile of book for a franticlooking hannah abbott i wish i could talk to sirius he muttered but i know i can not more to give himself something to do than because he really wanted any harry unwrapped his easter egg broke off a large bit and put it into his mouth well said ginny slowly helping herself to a bit of egg too if you really want to talk to sirius i expect we could think of a way to do it come on said harry hopelessly with umbridge policing the fire and reading all our mail the thing about growing up with fred and george said ginny thoughtfully is that you sort of start page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling thinking anythings possible if you have got enough nerve harry looked at her perhaps it wa the effect of the chocolate lupin had always advised eating some after encounter with dementors or simply because he had finally spoken aloud the wish that had been burning inside him for a week but he felt a bit more hopeful what do you think you are doing oh damn whispered ginny jumping to her foot i forgot madam pince wa swooping down upon them her shriveled face contorted with rage chocolate in the library she screamed out out out and whipping out her wand she caused harrys book bag and ink bottle to chase him and ginny from the library whacking them repeatedly over the head a they ran a though to underline the importance of their upcoming examination a batch of pamphlet leaflet and notice concerning various wizarding career appeared on the table in gryffindor tower shortly before the end of the holiday along with yet another notice on the board which read career advice all fifth year will be required to attend a short meeting with their head of house during the first week of the summer term in which they will be given page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the opportunity to discus their future career time of individual appointment are listed below harry looked down the list and found that he wa expected in professor mcgonagalls office at halfpast two on monday which would mean missing most of divination he and the other fifth year spent a considerable part of the final weekend of the easter break reading all the career information that had been left there for their perusal well i do not fancy healing said ron on the last evening of the holiday he wa immersed in a leaflet that carried the crossed boneandwand emblem of st mungos on it front it say here you need at least an e at newt level in potion herbology transfiguration charm and defense against the dark art i mean blimey do not want much do they well it a very responsible job is not it said hermione absently she wa poring over a bright pinkandorange leaflet that wa headed so you think you would like to work in muggle relation you do not seem to need many qualification to liaise with muggles all they want is an owl in muggle study much more important is your enthusiasm patience and a good sense offunv you would need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle said harry darkly good sense of when to duck more like he wa halfway through a pamphlet on wizard banking listen to this are you seeking a challenging career involving travel adventure and substantial dangerrelated treasure bonus then consider a position with gringotts wizarding bank who are currently recruiting curse p a g e harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling breaker for thrilling opportunity abroad they want arithmancy though you could do it hermione i do not much fancy banking said hermione vaguely now immersed in have you got what it take to train security troll hey said a voice in harrys ear he looked around fred and george had come to join them ginnys had a word with u about you said fred stretching out his leg on the table in front of them and causing several booklet on career with the ministry of magic to slide off onto the floor she say you need to talk to sirius what said hermione sharply freezing with her hand halfway toward picking up make a bang at the department of magical accident and catastrophe yeah said harry trying to sound casual yeah i thought id like do not be so ridiculous said hermione straightening up and looking at him a though she could not believe her eye with umbridge groping around in the fire and frisking all the owl well we think we can find a way around that said george stretching and smiling it a simple matter of causing a diversion now you might have noticed that we have been rather quiet on the mayhem front during the easter holiday what wa the point we asked ourselves of disrupting leisure time continued fred no point at all we answered ourselves and of course wed have page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling messed up people studying too which would be the very last thing wed want to do he gave hermione a sanctimonious little nod she looked rather taken aback by this thoughtfulness but it business a usual from tomorrow fred continued briskly and if were going to be causing a bit of uproar why not do it so that harry can have his chat with sirius yes but still said hermione with an air of explaining something very simple to somebody very obtuse even if you do because a diversion how is harry supposed to talk to him umbridges office said harry quietly he had been thinking about it for a fortnight and could think of no alternative umbridge herself had told him that the only fire that wa not being watched wa her own are you insane said hermione in a hushed voice ron had lowered his leaflet on job in the cultivated fungus trade and wa watching the conversation warily i do not think so said harry shrugging and how are you going to get in there in the first place harry wa ready for this question sirius knife he said page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling excuse me christmas before last sirius gave me a knife that will open any lock said harry so even if she is bewitched the door so alohomora will not work which i bet she ha what do you think about this hermione demanded of ron and harry wa reminded irresistibly of mr weasley appealing to her husband during harrys first dinner in grimmauld place i do not know said ron looking alarmed at being asked to give an opinion if harry want to do it it up to him is not it spoken like a true friend and weasley said fred clapping ron hard on the back right then were thinking of doing it tomorrow just after lesson because it should cause maximum impact if everybodys in the corridor harry well set it off in the east wing somewhere draw her right away from her own office i reckon we should be able to guarantee you what twenty minute he said looking at george easy said george what sort of diversion is it asked ron you will see little bro said fred a he and george got up again at least you will if you trot along to gregory the smarmys corridor round about five of the clock tomorrow harry awoke very early the next day feeling almost a anxious a he had done on the morning of his hearing at the ministry of magic it wa not only the prospect of breaking into umbridges office and using her fire page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling to speak to sirius that wa making him feel nervous though that wa certainly bad enough today also happened to be the first time he would be in close proximity with snape since snape had thrown him out of his office a they had potion that day after lying in bed for a while thinking about the day ahead harry got up very quietly and moved across to the window beside nevilles bed staring out on a truly glorious morning the sky wa a clear misty opalescent blue directly ahead of him harry could see the towering beech tree below which his father had once tormented snape he wa not sure what sirius could possibly say to him that would make up for what he had seen in the pensieve but he wa desperate to hear sirius own account of what had happened to know of any mitigating factor there might have been any excuse at all for his father behavior something caught harrys attention movement on the edge of the forbidden forest harry squinted into the sun and saw hagrid emerging from between the tree he seemed to be limping a harry watched hagrid staggered to the door of his cabin and disappeared inside it harry watched the cabin for several minute hagrid did not emerge again but smoke furled from the chimney so hagrid could not be so badly injured that he wa unequal to stoking the fire harry turned away from the window headed back to his trunk and started to dress with the prospect of forcing entry into umbridges office ahead harry had never expected the day to be a restful one but he had not reckoned on hermiones almost continual attempt to dissuade him from what he wa planning to do at five of the clock for the first time page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ever she wa at least a inattentive to professor binns in history of magic a harry and ron were keeping up a stream of whispered admonition that harry tried very hard to ignore and if she doe catch you there apart from being expelled she will be able to guess you have been talking to snuffle and this time i expect she will force you to drink veritaserum and answer her question hermione said ron in a low and indignant voice are you going to stop telling harry off and listen to binns or am i going to have to take note instead you take note for a change it will not kill you by the time they reached the dungeon neither harry nor ron wa speaking to hermione any longer undeterred she took advantage of their silence to maintain an uninterrupted flow of dire warning all uttered under her breath in a vehement hiss that caused seamus to waste five whole minute checking his cauldron for leak snape meanwhile seemed to have decided to act a though harry were invisible harry wa of course well used to this tactic a it wa one of uncle vernons favorite and on the whole wa grateful he had to suffer nothing worse in fact compared to what he usually had to endure from snape in the way of taunt and snide remark he found the new approach something of an improvement and wa pleased to find that when left well alone he wa able to concoct an invigoration draught quite easily at the end of the lesson he scooped some of the potion into a flask corked it and took it up to snapes desk for marking feeling that he might at last have scraped an e page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he had just turned away when he heard a smashing noise malfoy gave a gleeful yell of laughter harry whipped around again his potion sample lay in piece on the floor and snape wa watching him with a look of gloating pleasure whoop he said softly another zero then potter harry wa too incensed to speak he strode back to his cauldron intending to fill another flask and force snape to mark it but saw to his horror that the rest of the content had vanished i am sorry said hermione with her hand over her mouth i am really sorry harry i thought you would finished so i cleared up harry could not bring himself to answer when the bell rang he hurried out of the dungeon without a backward glance and made sure that he found himself a seat between neville and seamus for lunch so that hermione could not start nagging him about using umbridges office again he wa in such a bad mood by the time that he got to divination that he had quite forgotten his career appointment with professor mcgonagall remembering only when ron asked him why he wa not in her office he hurtled back upstairs and arrived out of breath only a few minute late sorry professor he panted a he closed the door i forgot no matter potter she said briskly but a she spoke somebody else sniffed from the corner harry looked around page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor umbridge wa sitting there a clipboard on her knee a fussy little piefrill around her neck and a small horribly smug smile on her face sit down potter said professor mcgonagall tersely her hand shook slightly a she shuffled the many pamphlet littering her desk harry sat down with his back to umbridge and did his best to pretend he could not hear the scratching of her quill on her clipboard well potter this meeting is to talk over any career idea you might have and to help you decide which subject you should continue into sixth and seventh year said professor mcgonagall have you had any thought about what you would like to do after you leave hogwarts er said harry he wa finding the scratching noise from behind him very distracting yes professor mcgonagall prompted harry well i thought of maybe being an auror harry mumbled you would need top grade for that said professor mcgonagall extracting a small dark leaflet from under the mass on her desk and opening it they ask for a minimum of five newt and nothing under exceeds expectation grade i see then you would be required to undergo a stringent series of character and aptitude test at the auror office it a difficult career path potter they only take the best in fact i do not think anybody ha been taken on in the last three year page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling at this moment professor umbridge gave a very tiny cough a though she wa trying to see how quietly she could do it professor mcgonagall ignored her you will want to know which subject you ought to take i suppose she went on talking a little more loudly than before yes said harry defense against the dark art i suppose naturally said professor mcgonagall crisply i would also advise professor umbridge gave another cough a little more audible this time professor mcgonagall closed her eye for a moment opened them again and continued a though nothing had happened i would also advise transfiguration because aurors frequently need to transfigure or untransfigure in their work and i ought to tell you now potter that i do not accept student into my newt class unless they have achieved exceeds expectation or higher at ordinary wizarding level id say you are averaging acceptable at the moment so you will need to put in some good hard work before the exam to stand a chance of continuing then you ought to do charm always useful and potion yes potter potion she added with the merest flicker of a smile poison and antidote are essential study for aurors and i must tell you that professor snape absolutely refuse to take student who get anything other than outstanding in their owl so professor umbridge gave her most pronounced cough yet page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling may i offer you a cough drop dolores professor mcgonagall asked curtly without looking at professor umbridge oh no thank you very much said umbridge with that simpering laugh harry hated so much i just wondered whether i could make the teensiest interruption minerva i daresay you find you can said professor mcgonagall through tightly gritted teeth i wa just wondering whether mr potter ha quite the temperament for an auror said professor umbridge sweetly were you said professor mcgonagall haughtily well potter she continued a though there had been no interruption if you are serious in this ambition i would advise you to concentrate hard on bringing your transfiguration and potion up to scratch i see professor flitwick ha graded you between acceptable and exceeds expectation for the last two year so your charm work seems satisfactory a for defense against the dark art your mark have been generally high professor lupin in particular thought you are you quite sure you would not like a cough drop dolores oh no need thank you minerva simpered professor umbridge who had just coughed her loudest yet i wa just concerned that you might not have harrys most recent defense against the dark art mark in front of you i am quite sure i slipped in a note what this thing said professor mcgonagall in a tone of revulsion a she pulled a sheet of pink parchment from between the leaf of harrys folder page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she glanced down it her eyebrow slightly raised then placed it back into the folder without comment yes a i wa saying potter professor lupin thought you showed a pronounced aptitude for the subject and obviously for an auror did you not understand my note minerva asked professor umbridge in honeyed tone quite forgetting to cough of course i understood it said professor mcgonagall her teeth clenched so tightly that the word came out a little muffled well then i am confused i am afraid i do not quite understand how you can give mr potter false hope that false hope repeated professor mcgonagall still refusing to look round at professor umbridge he ha achieved high mark in all his defense against the dark art test i am terribly sorry to have to contradict you minerva but a you will see from my note harry ha been achieving very poor result in his class with me i should have made my meaning plainer said professor mcgonagall turning at last to look umbridge directly in the eye he ha achieved high mark in all defense against the dark art test set by a competent teacher professor umbridges smile vanished a suddenly a a lightbulb blowing she sat back in her chair turned a sheet on her clipboard and began scribbling very fast indeed her bulging eye rolling from side to side page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor mcgonagall turned back to harry her thin nostril flared her eye burning any question potter yes said harry what sort of character and aptitude test do the ministry do on you if you get enough newt well you will need to demonstrate the ability to react well to pressure and so forth said professor mcgonagall perseverance and dedication because auror training take a further three year not to mention very high skill in practical defense it will mean a lot more study even after you have left school so unless you are prepared to i think you will also find said umbridge her voice very cold now that the ministry look into the record of those applying to be aurors their criminal record unless you are prepared to take even more exam after hogwarts you should really look at another which mean that this boy ha a much chance of becoming an auror a dumbledore ha of ever returning to this school a very good chance then said professor mcgonagall potter ha a criminal record said umbridge loudly potter ha been cleared of all charge said professor mcgonagall even more loudly professor umbridge stood up she wa so short that this did not make a great deal of difference but her page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fussy simpering demeanor had given place to a hard fury that made her broad flabby face look oddly sinister potter ha no chance whatsoever of becoming an auror professor mcgonagall got to her foot too and in her case this wa a much more impressive move she towered over professor umbridge potter she said in ringing tone i will assist you to become an auror if it is the last thing i do if i have to coach you nightly i will make sure you achieve the required result the minister of magic will never employ harry potter said umbridge her voice rising furiously there may well be a new minister of magic by the time potter is ready to join shouted professor mcgonagall aha shrieked professor umbridge pointing a stubby finger at mcgonagall yes yes yes yes of course that is what you want is not it minerva mcgonagall you want cornelius fudge replaced by albus dumbledore you think you will be where i am do not you senior undersecretary to the minister and headmistress to boot you are raving said professor mcgonagall superbly disdainful potter that concludes our career consultation harry swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried out of the room not daring to look at umbridge he could hear her and professor mcgonagall continuing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling to shout at each other all the way back along the corridor professor umbridge wa still breathing a though she had just run a race when she strode into their defense against the dark art lesson that afternoon i hope you have thought better of what you were planning to do harry hermione whispered the moment they had opened their book to chapter thirty four nonretaliation and negotiation umbridge look like she is in a really bad mood already every now and then umbridge shot glowering look at harry who kept his head down staring at defensive magical theory his eye unfocused thinking he could just imagine professor mcgonagalls reaction if he were caught trespassing in professor umbridges office mere hour after she had vouched for him there wa nothing to stop him simply going back to gryffindor tower and hoping that sometime during the next summer holiday he would have a chance to ask sirius about the scene he had witnessed in the pensieve nothing except that the thought of taking this sensible course of action made him feel a though a lead weight had dropped into his stomach and then there wa the matter of fred and george whose diversion wa already planned not to mention the knife sirius had given him which wa currently residing in his schoolbag along with his father old invisibility cloak but the fact remained that if he were caught dumbledore sacrificed himself to keep you in school harry whispered hermione raising her book to hide page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling her face from umbridge and if you get thrown out today it will all have been for nothing he could abandon the plan and simply learn to live with the memory of what his father had done on a summer day more than twenty year ago and then he remembered sirius in the fire upstairs in the gryffindor common room you re le like your father than i thought the risk would have been what made it fun for james but did he want to be like his father anymore harry do not do it please do not do it hermione said in anguished tone a the bell rang at the end of the class he did not answer he did not know what to do ron seemed determined to give neither his opinion nor his advice he would not look at harry though when hermione opened her mouth to try dissuading harry some more he said in a low voice give it a rest okay he can make up his own mind harrys heart beat very fast a he left the classroom he wa halfway along the corridor outside when he heard the unmistakable sound of a diversion going off in the distance there were scream and yell reverberating from somewhere above them people exiting the classroom all around harry were stopping in their track and looking up at the ceiling fearfully then umbridge came pelting out of her classroom a fast a her short leg would carry her pulling out her wand she hurried off in the opposite direction it wa now or never page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry please said hermione weakly but he had made up his mind hitching his bag more securely onto his shoulder he set off at a run weaving in and out of student now hurrying in the opposite direction off to see what all the fuss wa about in the east wing harry reached the corridor where umbridges office wa situated and found it deserted dashing behind a large suit of armor whose helmet creaked around to watch him he pulled open his bag seized sirius knife and donned the invisibility cloak he then crept slowly and carefully back out from behind the suit of armor and along the corridor until he reached umbridges door he inserted the blade of the magical knife into the crack around it and moved it gently up and down then withdrew it there wa a tiny click and the door swung open he ducked inside the office closed the door quickly behind him and looked around it wa empty nothing wa moving except the horrible kitten on the plate continuing to frolic on the wall above the confiscated broomstick harry pulled off his cloak and striding over to the fireplace found what he wa looking for within second a small box containing glittering floo powder he crouched down in front of the empty grate his hand shaking he had never done this before though he thought he knew how it must work sticking his head into the fireplace he took a large pinch of powder and dropped it onto the log stacked neatly beneath him they exploded at once into emeraldgreen flame page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling number twelve grimmauld place harry said loudly and clearly it wa one of the most curious sensation he had ever experienced he had traveled by floo powder before of course but then it had been his entire body that had spun around and around in the flame through the network of wizarding fireplace that stretched over the country this time his knee remained firm upon the cold floor of umbridges office and only his head hurtled through the emerald fire and then abruptly a it had begun the spinning stopped feeling rather sick and a though he wa wearing an exceptionally hot muffler around his head harry opened his eye to find that he wa looking up out of the kitchen fireplace at the long wooden table where a man sat poring over a piece of parchment sirius the man jumped and looked around it wa not sirius but lupin harry he said looking thoroughly shocked what are you what is happened is everything all right yeah said harry i just wondered i mean i just fancied a a chat with sirius ill call him said lupin getting to his foot still looking perplexed he went upstairs to look for kreacher he seems to be hiding in the attic again and harry saw lupin hurry out of the kitchen now he wa left with nothing to look at but the chair and table leg he wondered why sirius had never mentioned how very uncomfortable it wa to speak out of the fire his knee were already objecting page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling painfully to their prolonged contact with umbridges hard stone floor lupin returned with sirius at his heel moment later what is it said sirius urgently sweeping his long dark hair out of his eye and dropping to the ground in front of the fire so that he and harry were on a level lupin knelt down too looking very concerned are you all right do you need help no said harry it nothing like that i just wanted to talk about my dad they exchanged a look of great surprise but harry did not have time to feel awkward or embarrassed his knee were becoming sorer by the second and he guessed that five minute had already passed from the start of the diversion george had only guaranteed him twenty he therefore plunged immediately into the story of what he had seen in the pensieve when he had finished neither sirius nor lupin spoke for a moment then lupin said quietly i would not like you to judge your father on what you saw there harry he wa only fifteen i am fifteen said harry heatedly look harry said sirius placatingly james and snape hated each other from the moment they set eye on each other it wa just one of those thing you can understand that can not you i think james wa everything snape wanted to be he wa popular he wa good at quidditch good at pretty much everything and snape wa just this little oddball who wa up to his eye in the dark art and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling james whatever else he may have appeared to you harry always hated the dark art yeah said harry but he just attacked snape for no good reason just because well just because you said you were bored he finished with a slightly apologetic note in his voice i am not proud of it said sirius quickly lupin looked sideways at sirius and then said look harry what you have got to understand is that your father and sirius were the best in the school at whatever they did everyone thought they were the height of cool if they sometimes got a bit carried away if we were sometimes arrogant little berk you mean said sirius lupin smiled he kept messing up his hair said harry in a pained voice sirius and lupin laughed id forgotten he used to do that said sirius affectionately wa he playing with the snitch said lupin eagerly yeah said harry watching uncomprehendingly a sirius and lupin beamed reminiscently well i thought he wa a bit of an idiot of course he wa a bit of an idiot said sirius bracingly we were all idiot well not moony so page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling much he said fairly looking at lupin but lupin shook his head did i ever tell you to lay off snape he said did i ever have the gut to tell you i thought you were out of order yeah well said sirius you made u feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes that wa something and said harry doggedly determined to say everything that wa on his mind now he wa here he kept looking over at the girl by the lake hoping they were watching him oh well he always made a fool of himself whenever lily wa around said sirius shrugging he could not stop himself showing off whenever he got near her how come she married him harry asked miserably she hated him nah she did not said sirius she started going out with him in seventh year said lupin once james had deflated his head a bit said sirius and stopped hexing people just for the fun of it said lupin even snape said harry well said lupin slowly snape wa a special case i mean he never lost an opportunity to curse james so you could not really expect james to take that lying down could you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and my mum wa okay with that she did not know too much about it to tell you the truth said sirius i mean james did not take snape on date with her and jinx him in front of her did he sirius frowned at harry who wa still looking unconvinced look he said your father wa the best friend i ever had and he wa a good person a lot of people are idiot at the age of fifteen he grew out of it yeah okay said harry heavily i just never thought id feel sorry for snape now you mention it said lupin a faint crease between his eyebrow how did snape react when he found you would seen all this he told me he would never teach me occlumency again said harry indifferently like that is a big disappoint he what shouted sirius causing harry to jump and inhale a mouthful of ash are you serious harry said lupin quickly he stopped giving you lesson yeah said harry surprised at what he considered a great overreaction but it okay i do not care it a bit of a relief to tell you the i am coming up there to have a word with snape said sirius forcefully and he actually made to stand up but lupin wrenched him back down again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling if anyones going to tell snape it will be me he said firmly but harry first of all you are to go back to snape and tell him that on no account is he to stop giving you lesson when dumbledore hears i can not tell him that he would kill me said harry outraged you did not see him when we got out of the pensieve harry there is nothing so important a you learning occlumency said lupin sternly do you understand me nothing okay okay said harry thoroughly discomposed not to mention annoyed ill ill try and say something to him but it will not be he fell silent he could hear distant footstep is that kreacher coming downstairs no said sirius glancing behind him it must be somebody your end harrys heart skipped several beat id better go he said hastily and he pulled his head backward out of grimmauld place fire for a moment his head seemed to be revolving on his shoulder and then he found himself kneeling in front of umbridges fire with his head firmly back on watching the emerald flame flicker and die quickly quickly he heard a wheezy voice mutter right outside the office door ah she is left it open harry dived for the invisibility cloak and had just managed to pull it back over himself when filch burst into the office he looked absolutely delighted about page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling something and wa talking to himself feverishly a he crossed the room pulled open a drawer in umbridges desk and began rifling through the paper inside it approval for whipping approval for whipping i can do it at last they have had it coming to them for year he pulled out a piece of parchment kissed it then shuffled rapidly back out of the door clutching it to his chest harry leapt to his foot and making sure that he had his bag and the invisibility cloak wa completely covering him he wrenched open the door and hurried out of the office after filch who wa hobbling along faster than harry had ever seen him go one landing down from umbridges office and harry thought it wa safe to become visible again he pulled off the cloak shoved it in his bag and hurried onward there wa a great deal of shouting and movement coming from the entrance hall he ran down the marble staircase and found what looked like most of the school assembled there it wa just like the night when trelawney had been sacked student were standing all around the wall in a great ring some of them harry noticed covered in a substance that looked very like stinksap teacher and ghost were also in the crowd prominent among the onlooker were member of the inquisitorial squad who were all looking exceptionally pleased with themselves and peeve who wa bobbing overhead gazed down upon fred and george who stood in the middle of the floor with the unmistakable look of two people who had just been cornered page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling so said umbridge triumphantly whom harry realized wa standing just a few stair in front of him once more looking down upon her prey so you think it amusing to turn a school corridor into a swamp do you pretty amusing yeah said fred looking back up at her without the slightest sign of fear filch elbowed his way closer to umbridge almost cry with happiness i have got the form headmistress he said hoarsely waving the piece of parchment harry had just seen him take from her desk i have got the form and i have got the whip waiting oh let me do it now very good argus she said you two she went on gazing down at fred and george are about to learn what happens to wrongdoer in my school you know what said fred i do not think we are he turned to his twin george said fred i think we have outgrown fulltime education yeah i have been feeling that way myself said george lightly time to test our talent in the real world dyou reckon asked fred definitely said george and before umbridge could say a word they raised their wand and said together accio broomsv page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance looking to his left he ducked just in time fred and george broomstick one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which umbridge had fastened them to the wall were hurtling along the corridor toward their owner they turned left streaked down the stair and stopped sharply in front of the twin the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor we will not be seeing you fred told professor umbridge swinging his leg over his broomstick yeah do not bother to keep in touch said george mounting his own fred looked around at the assembled student and at the silent watchful crowd if anyone fancy buying a portable swamp a demonstrated upstairs come to number ninetythree diagon alley weasleys wizarding wheeze he said in a loud voice our new premise special discount to hogwarts student who swear they are going to use our product to get rid of this old bat added george pointing at professor umbridge stop them shrieked umbridge but it wa too late a the inquisitorial squad closed in fred and george kicked off from the floor shooting fifteen foot into the air the iron peg swinging dangerously below fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd give her hell from u peeve and peeve whom harry had never seen take an order from a student before swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute a fred and george page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the student below and sped out of the open front door into the glorious sunset page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling grawp the story of fred and george flight to freedom wa retold so often over the next few day that harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of hogwarts legend within a week even those who had been eyewitness were half convinced that they had seen the twin divebomb umbridge on their broom pelting her with dungbombs before zooming out of the door in the immediate aftermath of their departure there wa a great wave of talk about copying them so that harry frequently heard student saying thing like honestly some day i just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place or else one more lesson like that and i might just do a weasley fred and george had made sure that nobody wa likely to forget them very soon for one thing they had not left instruction on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing umbridge and filch had been observed trying different mean of removing it but without success eventually the area wa roped off and filch page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling gnashing his teeth furiously wa given the task of punting student across it to their classroom harry wa certain that teacher like mcgonagall or flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but just a in the case of fred and george wildfire whiz bang they seemed to prefer to watch umbridge struggle then there were the two large broomshaped hole in umbridge s office door through which fred and george cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their master filch fitted a new door and removed harrys firebolt to the dungeon where it wa rumored umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it however her trouble were far from over inspired by fred and george example a great number of student were now vying for the newly vacant position of troublemakersinchief in spite of the new door somebody managed to slip a hairy snouted niffler into umbridge s office which promptly tore the place apart in it search for shiny object leapt on umbridge on her reentrance and tried to gnaw the ring off her stubby finger dungbombs and stinkpellets were dropped so frequently in the corridor that it became the new fashion for student to perform bubblehead charm on themselves before leaving lesson which ensured them a supply of fresh clean air even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upsidedown goldfish bowl on their head filch prowled the corridor with a horsewhip ready in his hand desperate to catch miscreant but the problem wa that there were now so many of them that he did not know which way to turn the inquisitorial squad were attempting to help him but odd thing kept happening to it member warrington of the slytherin quidditch team reported page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look a though he had been coated in cornflakes pansy parkinson to hermiones delight missed all her lesson the following day a she had sprouted antler meanwhile it became clear just how many skiving snackboxes fred and george had managed to sell before leaving hogwarts umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the student assembled there to faint vomit develop dangerous fever or else spout blood from both nostril shrieking with rage and frustration she attempted to trace the mysterious symptom to their source but the student told her stubbornly they were suffering umbridgeitis after putting four successive class in detention and failing to discover their secret she wa forced to give up and allow the bleeding swooning sweating and vomiting student to leave her class in drove but not even the user of the snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos peeve who seemed to have taken freds parting word deeply to heart cackling madly he soared through the school upending table bursting out of blackboard and toppling statue and vas twice he shut mr norris inside suit of armor from which she wa rescued yowling loudly by the furious caretaker he smashed lantern and snuffed out candle juggled burning torch over the head of screaming student caused neatly stacked pile of parchment to topple into fire or out of window flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the tap in the bathroom dropped a bag of tarantula in the middle of the great hall during breakfast and whenever he fancied a break spent hour at a time floating along after umbridge and blowing loud raspberry every time she spoke page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling none of the staff but filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her indeed a week after fred and george departure harry witnessed professor mcgonagall walking right past peeve who wa determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth it unscrews the other way to cap matter montague had still not recovered from his sojourn in the toilet he remained confused and disorientated and his parent were to be observed one tuesday morning striding up the front drive looking extremely angry should we say something said hermione in a worried voice pressing her cheek against the charm window so that she could see mr and mr montague marching inside about what happened to him in case it help madam pomfrey cure him course not hell recover said ron indifferently anyway more trouble for umbridge is not it said harry in a satisfied voice he and ron both tapped the teacup they were supposed to be charming with their wand harrys spouted four very short leg that would not reach the desk and wriggled pointlessly in midair ron grew four very thin spindly leg that hoisted the cup off the desk with great difficulty trembled for a few second then folded causing the cup to crack into two reparo said hermione quickly mending ron cup with a wave of her wand that is all very well but what if montagues permanently injured page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling who care said ron irritably while his teacup stood drunkenly again trembling violently at the knee montague should not have tried to take all those point from gryffindor should he if you want to worry about anyone hermione worry about me you she said catching her teacup a it scampered happily away across the desk on four sturdy little willowpatterned leg and replacing it in front of her why should i be worried about you when mum next letter finally get through umbridges screening process said ron bitterly now holding his cup up while it frail leg tried feebly to support it weight i am going to be in deep trouble i would not be surprised if she is sent a howler again but it will be my fault fred and george left you wait said ron darkly she will say i should have stopped them leaving i should have grabbed the end of their broom and hung on or something yeah it will be all my fault well if she doe say that it will be very unfair you could not have done anything but i am sure she will not i mean if it really true they have got premise in diagon alley now they must have been planning this for age yeah but that is another thing how did they get premise said ron hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that it leg collapsed again and it lay twitching before him it a bit dodgy is not it they will need load of galleon to afford the rent on a place in diagon alley she will want to know what they have been up to to get their hand on that sort of gold page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well yes that occurred to me too said hermione allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circle around harrys whose stubby little leg were still unable to touch the desktop i have been wondering whether mundungus ha persuaded them to sell stolen good or something awful he ha not said harry curtly how do you know said ron and hermione together because harry hesitated but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come there wa no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that fred and george were criminal because they got the gold from me i gave them my triwizard winning last june there wa a shocked silence then hermiones teacup jogged right over the edge of the desk and smashed on the floor oh harry you did not she said yes i did said harry mutinously and i do not regret it either i did not need the gold and they will be great at a joke shop but this is excellent said ron looking thrilled it all your fault harry mum can not blame me at all can i tell her yeah i suppose you would better said harry dully specially if she think they are receiving stolen cauldron or something hermione said nothing at all for the rest of the lesson but harry had a shrewd suspicion that her self restraint wa bound to crack before long sure page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling enough once they had left the castle for break and were standing around in the weak may sunshine she fixed harry with a beady eye and opened her mouth with a determined air harry interrupted her before she had even started it no good nagging me it done he said firmly fred and george have got the gold spent a good bit of it too by the sound of it and i can not get it back from them and i do not want to so save your breath hermione i wa not going to say anything about fred and george she said in an injured voice ron snorted disbelievingly and hermione threw him a very dirty look no i wa not she said angrily a a matter of fact i wa going to ask harry when he going to go back to snape and ask for occlumency lesson again harrys heart sank once they had exhausted the subject of fred and george dramatic departure which admittedly had taken many hour ron and hermione had wanted to hear news of sirius a harry had not confided in them the reason he had wanted to talk to sirius in the first place it had been hard to think of thing to tell them he had ended up saying to them truthfully that sirius wanted harry to resume occlumency lesson he had been regretting this ever since hermione would not let the subject drop and kept reverting to it when harry least expected it you can not tell me you have stopped having funny dream hermione said now because ron told me last night you were muttering in your sleep again page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry threw ron a furious look ron had the grace to look ashamed of himself you were only muttering a bit he mumbled apologetically something about just a bit farther i dreamed i wa watching you lot play quidditch harry lied brutally i wa trying to get you to stretch out a bit farther to grab the quaffle ron ear went red harry felt a kind of vindictive pleasure he had not of course dreamed anything of the sort last night he had once again made the journey along the department of mystery corridor he had passed through the circular room then the room full of clicking and dancing light until he found himself again inside that cavernous room full of shelf on which were ranged dusty glass sphere he had hurried straight toward row number ninety seven turned left and ran along it it had probably been then that he had spoken aloud just a bit farther for he could feel his conscious self struggling to wake and before he had reached the end of the row he had found himself lying in bed again gazing up at the canopy of his fourposter you are trying to block your mind are not you said hermione looking beadily at harry you are keeping going with your occlumency of course i am said harry trying to sound a though this question wa insulting but not quite meeting her eye the truth wa that he wa so intensely curious about what wa hidden in that room full of dusty orb that he wa quite keen for the dream to continue page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the problem wa that with just under a month to go until the exam and every free moment devoted to studying his mind seemed saturated with information when he went to bed so that he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all when he did his overwrought brain presented him most night with stupid dream about the exam he also suspected that part of his mind the part that often spoke in hermiones voice now felt guilty on the occasion it strayed down that corridor ending in the black door and sought to wake him before he could reach journey end you know said ron whose ear were still flaming red if montague doe not recover before slytherin play hufflepuff we might be in with a chance of winning the cup yeah i spose so said harry glad of a change of subject i mean we have won one lost one if slytherin lose to hufflepuff next saturday yeah that is right said harry losing track of what he wa agreeing to cho chang had just walked across the courtyard determinedly not looking at him the final match of the quidditch season gryffindor versus ravenclaw wa to take place on the last weekend of may although slytherin had been narrowly defeated by hufflepuff in their last match gryffindor wa not daring to hope for victory due mainly though of course nobody said it to him to ron abysmal goalkeeping record he however seemed to have found a new optimism page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i mean i can not get any worse can i he told harry and hermione grimly over breakfast on the morning of the match nothing to lose now is there you know said hermione a she and harry walked down to the pitch a little later in the midst of a very excitable crowd i think ron might do better without fred and george around they never exactly gave him a lot of confidence luna lovegood overtook them with what appeared to be a live eagle perched on top of her head oh gosh i forgot said hermione watching the eagle flapping it wing a luna walked serenely past a group of cackling and pointing slytherins cho will be playing will not she harry who had not forgotten this merely grunted they found seat in the topmost row of the stand it wa a fine clear day ron could not wish for better and harry found himself hoping against hope that ron would not give the slytherins because for more rousing chorus of weasley is our king lee jordan who had been very dispirited since fred and george had left wa commentating a usual a the team zoomed out onto the pitch he named the player with something le than his usual gusto bradley davy chang he said and harry felt his stomach perform le of a back flip more a feeble lurch a cho walked out onto the pitch her shiny black hair rippling in the slight breeze he wa not sure what he wanted to happen anymore except that he could not stand any more row even the sight of her chatting animatedly to roger davy a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they prepared to mount their broom caused him only a slight twinge of jealousy and they are off said lee and davy take the quaffle immediately ravenclaw captain davy with the quaffle he dodge johnson he dodge bell he dodge spinnet a well he going straight for goal he going to shoot and and lee swore very loudly and he scored harry and hermione groaned with the rest of the gryffindors predictably horribly the slytherins on the other side of the stand began to sing weasley can not save a thing he can not block a single ring harry said a hoarse voice in harrys ear hermione harry looked around and saw hagrids enormous bearded face sticking between the seat apparently he had squeezed his way all along the row behind for the first and second year he had just passed had a ruffled flattened look about them for some reason hagrid wa bent double a though anxious not to be seen though he wa still at least four foot taller than everybody else listen he whispered can yeh come with me now while evryones watchin the match er can not it wait hagrid asked harry till the match is over no said hagrid no harry it got to be now while evryones lookin the other way please page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hagrids nose wa gently dripping blood his eye were both blackened harry had not seen him this close up since his return to the school he looked utterly woebegone course said harry at once course well come he and hermione edged back along their row of seat causing much grumbling among the student who had to stand up for them the people in hagrids row were not complaining merely attempting to make themselves a small a possible i ppreciate this you two i really do said hagrid a they reached the stair he kept looking around nervously a they descended toward the lawn below i jus hope she doesn notice u goin you mean umbridge said harry she will not she is got her whole inquisitorial squad sitting with her did not you see she must be expecting trouble at the match yeah well a bit o trouble wouldn hurt said hagrid pausing to peer around the edge of the stand to make sure the stretch of lawn between there and his cabin wa deserted give u more time what is it hagrid said hermione looking up at him with a concerned expression on her face a they hurried across the lawn toward the edge of the forest yeh yehll see in a mo said hagrid looking over his shoulder a a great roar rose from the stand behind them hey did someone jus score it will be ravenclaw said harry heavily page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling good good said hagrid distractedly thas good they had to jog to keep up with him a he strode across the lawn looking around with every other step when they reached his cabin hermione turned automatically left toward the front door hagrid however walked straight past it into the shade of the tree on the outermost edge of the forest where he picked up a crossbow that wa leaning against a tree when he realized they were no longer with him he turned were goin in here he said jerking his shaggy head behind him into the forest said hermione perplexed yeah said hagrid cmon now quick before were spotted harry and hermione looked at each other then ducked into the cover of the tree behind hagrid who wa already striding away from them into the green gloom his crossbow over his arm harry and hermione ran to catch up with him hagrid why are you armed said harry jus a precaution said hagrid shrugging his massive shoulder you did not bring your crossbow the day you showed u the thestrals said hermione timidly nah well we weren goin in so far then said hagrid an anyway tha wa before firenze left the forest wasn it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling why doe firenze leaving make a difference asked hermione curiously because the other centaur are good an riled at me thas why said hagrid quietly glancing around they used ter be well yeh couldn call them friendly but we got on all righ kept emselves to emselves bu always turned up if i wanted a word not anymore he sighed deeply firenze said that they are angry because he went to work for dumbledore harry asked tripping on a protruding root because he wa busy watching hagrid s profile yeah said hagrid heavily well angry doesn cover it ruddy livid if i hadn stepped in i reckon they would ve kicked firenze ter death they attacked him said hermione sounding shocked yep said hagrid gruffly forcing his way through several lowhanging branch he had half the herd onto him and you stopped it said harry amazed and impressed by yourself course i did could not stand by an watch them kill him could i said hagrid lucky i wa passin really an i would have thought firenze mighta remembered tha before he started sendin me stupid warnins he added hotly and unexpectedly harry and hermione looked at each other startled but hagrid scowling did not elaborate page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling anyway he said breathing a little more heavily than usual since then the other centaur ve bin livid with me an the trouble is they have got a lot of influence in the forest cleverest creature in here is that why were here hagrid asked hermione the centaur ah no said hagrid shaking his head dismissively no it not them well o course they could complicate the problem yeah but yehll see what i mean in a bit on this incomprehensible note he fell silent and forged a little ahead taking one stride for every three of theirs so that they had great trouble keeping up with him the path wa becoming increasingly overgrown and the tree grew so closely together a they walked farther and farther into the forest that it wa a dark a dusk they were soon a long way past the clearing where hagrid had shown them the thestrals but harry felt no sense of unease until hagrid stepped unexpectedly off the path and began wending his way in and out of tree toward the dark heart of the forest hagrid said harry fighting his way through thickly knotted bramble over which hagrid had stepped easily and remembering very vividly what had happened to him on the other occasion he had stepped off the forest path where are we going bit further said hagrid over his shoulder cmon harry we need ter keep together now it wa a great struggle to keep up with hagrid what with branch and thicket of thorn through which page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hagrid marched a easily a though they were cobweb but which snagged harry and hermiones robe frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minute at a time to free themselves harrys arm and leg were soon covered in small cut and scratch they were so deep in the forest now that sometimes all harry could see of hagrid in the gloom wa a massive dark shape ahead of him any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence the breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow caused harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit it occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the forest without meeting some kind of creature their absence struck him a rather ominous hagrid would it be all right if we lit our wand said hermione quietly er all righ hagrid whispered back in fact he stopped suddenly and turned around hermione walked right into him and wa knocked over backward harry caught her just before she hit the forest floor maybe we be jus stop fer a momen so i can fill yeh in said hagrid before we ge there like good said hermione a harry set her back on her foot they both murmured lumos and their wand tip ignited hagrid s face swam through the gloom by the light of the two wavering beam and harry saw that he looked nervous and sad again righ said hagrid well see the thing is he took a great breath page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well there is a good chance i am goin ter be gettin the sack any day now he said harry and hermione looked at each other then back at him but you have lasted this long hermione said tentatively what make you think umbridge reckons it wa me that put tha niffler in her office and wa it said harry before he could stop himself no it ruddy well wasn said hagrid indignantly ony anythin ter do with magical creature an she think it got somethin ter do with me yeh know she is bin lookin fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since i got back i don wan ter go o course but if it wasn fer well the special circumstance i am abou ter explain to yeh id leave righ now before she is go the chance ter do it in front o the whole school like she did with trelawney harry and hermione both made noise of protest but hagrid overrode them with a wave of one of his enormous hand it not the end o the world ill be able ter help dumbledore once i am outta here i can be useful ter the order an you lotll have grubblyplank yehll yehll get through yer exam fine his voice trembled and broke don worry abou me he said hastily a hermione made to pat his arm he pulled his enormous spotted handkerchief from the pocket of his waistcoat and mopped his eye with it look i wouldn be tellin yer page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling this at all if i didn have ter see if i go well i can leave withou withou fellin someone because ill ill need you two ter help me an ron if he willin of course well help you said harry at once what do you want u to do hagrid gave a great sniff and patted harry wordlessly on the shoulder with such force that harry wa knocked sideways into a tree i knew yehd say yes said hagrid into his handkerchief but i won never forget well cmon jus a little bit further through here watch yerselves now there is nettle they walked on in silence for another fifteen minute harry had opened his mouth to ask how much farther they had to go when hagrid threw out his right arm to signal that they should stop really easy he said softly very quiet now they crept forward and harry saw that they were facing a large smooth mound of earth nearly a tall a hagrid that he thought with a jolt of dread wa sure to be the lair of some enormous animal tree had been ripped up at the root all around the mound so that it stood on a bare patch of ground surrounded by heap of trunk and bough that formed a kind of fence or barricade behind which harry hermione and hagrid now stood sleepin breathed hagrid sure enough harry could hear a distant rhythmic rumbling that sounded like a pair of enormous lung at work he glanced sideways at hermione who wa page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling gazing at the mound with her mouth slightly open she looked utterly terrified hagrid she said in a whisper barely audible over the sound of the sleeping creature who is he harry found this an odd question what is it wa the one he had been planning on asking hagrid you told u said hermione her wand now shaking in her hand you told u none of them wanted to come harry looked from her to hagrid and then a realization hit him he looked back at the mound with a small gasp of horror the great mound of earth on which he hermione and hagrid could easily have stood wa moving slowly up and down in time with the deep grunting breathing it wa not a mound at all it wa the curved back of what wa clearly well no he didn want ter come said hagrid sounding desperate but i had ter bring him hermione i had ter but why asked hermione who sounded a though she wanted to cry why what oh hagrid i knew if i jus got him back said hagrid sounding close to tear himself an an taught him a few manner id be able ter take him outside an show evryone he harmless harmless said hermione shrilly and hagrid made frantic hushing noise with his hand a the enormous creature before them grunted loudly and shifted in it sleep he been hurting you all this page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling time ha not he that is why you have had all these injury he don know his own strength said hagrid earnestly an he gettin better he not fightin so much anymore so this is why it took you two month to get home said hermione distractedly oh hagrid why did you bring him back if he did not want to come would not he have been happier with his own people they were all bullyin him hermione because he so small said hagrid small said hermione small hermione i couldn leave him said hagrid tear now trickling down his bruised face into his beard see he my brother hermione simply stared at him her mouth open hagrid when you say brother said harry slowly do you mean well halfbrother amended hagrid turn out me mother took up with another giant when she left me dad an she went an had grawp here grawp said harry yeah well thas what it sound like when he say his name said hagrid anxiously he don speak a lot of english i have bin tryin ter teach him anyway she don seem ter have liked him much moren she liked me see with giantess what count is producin good big kid and he always been a bit on the runty side fer a giant ony sixteen foot page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh yes tiny said hermione with a kind of hysterical sarcasm absolutely minuscule he wa bein kicked around by all o them i jus couldn leave him did madame maxime want to bring him back asked harry she well she could see it wa right importan ter me said hagrid twisting his enormous hand bu bu she got a bit tired of him after a while i must admit so we split up on the journey home she promised not ter tell anyone though how on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing said harry well thas why it took so long see said hagrid could ony travel by nigh an through wild country an stuff course he cover the ground pretty well when he want ter but he kep wantin ter go back oh hagrid why on earth did not you let him said hermione flopping down onto a rippedup tree and burying her face in her hand what do you think you are going to do with a violent giant who doe not even want to be here well now violent thas a bit harsh said hagrid still twisting his hand agitatedly ill admit he mighta taken a couple o swing at me when he bin in a bad mood but he gettin better load better settlin down well what are those rope for then harry asked he had just noticed rope thick a sapling stretching from around the trunk of the largest nearby tree page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling toward the place where grawp lay curled on the ground with his back to them you have to keep him tied up said hermione faintly well yeah said hagrid looking anxious see it like i say he doesn really know his strength harry understood now why there had been such a suspicious lack of any other living creature in this part of the forest so what is it you want harry and ron and me to do hermione asked apprehensively look after him said hagrid croakily after i am gone harry and hermione exchanged miserable look harry uncomfortably aware that he had already promised hagrid that he would do whatever he asked what what doe that involve exactly hermione inquired not food or anythin said hagrid eagerly he can get his own food no problem bird an deer an stuff no it company he need if i jus knew someone wa carryin on tryin ter help him a bit teachin him yeh know harry said nothing but turned to look back at the gigantic form lying asleep on the ground in front of them grawp had his back to them unlike hagrid who simply looked like a very oversize human grawp looked strangely misshapen what harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognized a grawp s head page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa much larger in proportion to the body than a human head almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling closegrowing hair the color of bracken the rim of a single large fleshy ear wa visible on top of the head which seemed to sit rather like uncle vernons directly upon the shoulder with little or no neck in between the back under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skin sewn roughly together wa very broad and a grawp slept it seemed to strain a little at the rough seam of the skin the leg were curled up under the body harry could see the sol of enormous filthy bare foot large a sledge resting one on top of the other on the earthy forest floor you want u to teach him harry said in a hollow voice he now understood what firenze warning had meant his attempt is not working he would do better to abandon it of course the other creature who lived in the forest would have heard hagrids fruitless attempt to teach grawp english yeah even if yeh jus talk ter him a bit said hagrid hopefully because i reckon if he can talk ter people hell understand more that we all like him really an want him to stay harry looked at hermione who peered back at him from between the finger over her face kind of make you wish we had norbert back doe not it he said and she gave a very shaky laugh yehll do it then said hagrid who did not seem to have caught what harry had just said well said harry already bound by his promise well try hagrid page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i knew i could count on yeh harry hagrid said beaming in a very watery way and dabbing at his face with his handkerchief again an i don wan yeh ter put yerself out too much like i know yehve got exam if yeh could jus nip down here in yer invisibility cloak maybe once a week an have a little chat with him ill wake him up then introduce you wha no said hermione jumping up hagrid no do not wake him really we do not need but hagrid had already stepped over the great trunk in front of them and wa proceeding toward grawp when he wa around ten foot away he lifted a long broken bough from the ground smiled reassuringly over his shoulder at harry and hermione and then poked grawp hard in the middle of the back with the end of the bough the giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent forest bird in the treetop overhead rose twittering from their perch and soared away in front of harry and hermione meanwhile the gigantic grawp wa rising from the ground which shuddered a he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself onto his knee and turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him all righ grawpy said hagrid in a wouldbe cheery voice backing away with the long bough raised ready to poke grawp again had a nice sleep eh harry and hermione retreated a far a they could while still keeping the giant within their sight grawp knelt between two tree he had not yet uprooted they looked up into his startlingly huge face which resembled a gray full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing it wa a though the feature had been page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hewn onto a great stone ball the nose wa stubby and shapeless the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of halfbricks the small eye were a muddy greenishbrown and just now were half gummed together with sleep grawp raised dirty knuckle a big a cricket ball to his eye rubbed vigorously then without warning pushed himself to his foot with surprising speed and agility oh my harry heard hermione squeal terrified beside him the tree to which the other end of the rope around grawps wrist and ankle were attached creaked ominously he wa a hagrid had said at least sixteen foot tall gazing blearily around he reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella seized a bird nest from the upper branch of a towering pine and turned it upside down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there wa no bird in it egg fell like grenade toward the ground and hagrid threw his arm over his head to protect himself anyway grawpy shouted hagrid looking up apprehensively in case of further falling egg i have brought some friend ter meet yeh remember i told yeh i might remember when i said i might have ter go on a little trip an leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit remember that grawpy but grawp merely gave another low roar it wa hard to say whether he wa listening to hagrid or whether he even recognized the sound hagrid wa making a speech he had now seized the top of the pine tree and wa pulling it toward him evidently for the simple pleasure of seeing how far it would spring back when he let go page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling now grawpy don do that shouted hagrid thas how you ended up pullin up the others and sure enough harry could see the earth around the tree root beginning to crack i got company fer yeh hagrid shouted company see look down yeh big buffoon i brought yeh some friend oh hagrid do not moaned hermione but hagrid had already raised the bough again and gave grawps knee a sharp poke the giant let go of the top of the pine tree which swayed menacingly and deluged hagrid with a rain of needle and looked down this said hagrid hastening over to where harry and hermione stood is harry grawp harry potter he migh be cornin ter visit yeh if i have ter go away understand the giant had only just realized that harry and hermione were there they watched in great trepidation a he lowered his huge boulder of a head so that he could peer blearily at them an this is hermione see her hagrid hesitated turning to hermione he said would yeh mind if he called yeh hermy hermione ony it a difficult name fer him ter remember no not at all squeaked hermione this is hermy grawp an she is going to be cornin an all isn tha nice eh two friend fer yeh ter grawpy no page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling grawps hand had shot out of nowhere toward hermione harry seized her and pulled her backward behind the tree so that grawps fist scraped the trunk but closed on thin air bad boy grawpy harry heard hagrid yelling a hermione clung to harry behind the tree shaking and whimpering very bad boy yeh don grab ouch harry poked his head out from around the trunk and saw hagrid lying on his back his hand over his nose grawp apparently losing interest had straightened up again and wa again engaged in pulling back the pine a far a it would go righ said hagrid thickly getting up with one hand pinching his bleeding nose and the other grasping his crossbow well there yeh are yehve met him an an now hell know yeh when yeh come back yeah well he looked up at grawp who wa now pulling back the pine with an expression of detached pleasure on his boulderish face the root were creaking a he ripped them away from the ground well i reckon thas enough fer one day said hagrid well er well go back now shall we harry and hermione nodded hagrid shouldered his crossbow again and still pinching his nose led the way back into the tree nobody spoke for a while not even when they heard the distant crash that meant grawp had pulled over the pine tree at last hermiones face wa pale and set harry could not think of a single thing to say what on earth wa going to happen when somebody page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling found out that hagrid had hidden grawp in the forest and he had promised that he ron and hermione would continue hagrids totally pointless attempt to civilize the giant how could hagrid even with his immense capacity to delude himself that fanged monster were lovably harmless fool himself that grawp would ever be fit to mix with human hold it said hagrid abruptly just a harry and hermione were struggling through a patch of thick knotgrass behind him he pulled an arrow out of the quiver over his shoulder and fitted it into the crossbow harry and hermione raised their wand now that they had stopped walking they too could hear movement close by oh blimey said hagrid quietly i thought that we told you hagrid said a deep male voice that you are no longer welcome here a man naked torso seemed for an instant to be floating toward them through the dappled green half light then they saw that his waist joined smoothly with a horse chestnut body this centaur had a proud highcheekboned face and long black hair like hagrid he wa armed a quiverful of arrow and a long bow were slung over his shoulder how are yeh magorian said hagrid warily the tree behind the centaur rustled and four or five more emerged behind him harry recognized the blackbodied and bearded bane whom he had met nearly four year ago on the same night he had met firenze bane gave no sign that he had ever seen harry before page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling so he said with a nasty inflection in his voice before turning immediately to magorian we agreed i think what we would do if this human showed his face in the forest again this human now am i said hagrid testily jus fer stoppin all of yeh committin murder you ought not to have meddled hagrid said magorian our way are not yours nor are our law firenze ha betrayed and dishonored u i do not know how yeh work that out said hagrid impatiently he done nothin except help albus dumbledore firenze ha entered into servitude to human said a gray centaur with a hard deeply lined face servitude said hagrid scathingly he doin dumbledore a favor is all he is peddling our knowledge and secret among human said magorian quietly there can be no return from such disgrace if yeh say so said hagrid shrugging but personally i think yeh re makin a big mistake a are you human said bane coming back into our forest when we warned you now you listen ter me said hagrid angrily ill have le of the our forest if it all the same ter you it not up ter you who come an go in here no more is it up to you hagrid said magorian smoothly i shall let you pas today because you are accompanied by your young page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they are not his interrupted bane contemptuously student magorian from up at the school they have probably already profited from the traitor f irenze s teaching nevertheless said magorian calmly the slaughter of foal is a terrible crime we do not touch the innocent today hagrid you pas henceforth stay away from this place you forfeited the friendship of the centaur when you helped the traitor firenze escape u i won be kept outta the fore by a bunch of mule like you said hagrid loudly hagrid said hermione in a highpitched and terrified voice a both bane and the gray centaur pawed at the ground let u go please let u go hagrid moved forward but his crossbow wa still raised and his eye were still fixed threateningly upon magorian we know what you are keeping in the forest hagrid magorian called after them a the centaur slipped out of sight and our tolerance is waning hagrid turned and gave every appearance of wanting to walk straight back to magorian again you will tolerate him a long a he here it a much his forest a yours he yelled while harry and hermione both pushed with all their might against hagrid s moleskin waistcoat in an effort to keep him moving forward still scowling he looked down his expression changed to mild surprise at the sight of them both pushing him he seemed not to have felt it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling calm down you two he said turning to walk on while they panted along behind him ruddy old nag though eh hagrid said hermione breathlessly skirting the patch of nettle they had passed on their way there if the centaur do not want human in the forest it doe not really look a though harry and i will be able ah you heard what they said said hagrid dismissively they would not hurt foal i mean kid anyway we can let ourselves be pushed around by that lot nice try harry murmured to hermione who looked crestfallen at last they rejoined the path and after another ten minute the tree began to thin they were able to see patch of clear blue sky again and hear in the distance the definite sound of cheering and shouting wa that another goal asked hagrid pausing in the shelter of the tree a the quidditch stadium came into view or dyou reckon the match is over i do not know said hermione miserably harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear her hair wa full of bit of twig and leaf her robe were ripped in several place and there were numerous scratch on her face and arm he knew he could look little better i reckon it over yeh know said hagrid still squinting toward the stadium look there is people cornin out already if you two hurry yeh ll be able page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ter blend in with the crowd an no onell know you were not there good idea said harry well see you later then hagrid i do not believe him said hermione in a very unsteady voice the moment they were out of earshot of hagrid i do not believe him i really do not believe him calm down said harry calm down she said feverishly a giant a giant in the forest and were supposed to give him english lesson always assuming of course we can get past the herd of murderous centaur on the way in and out i do not believe him we have not got to do anything yet harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice a they joined a stream of jabbering hufflepuffs heading back toward the castle he not asking u to do anything unless he get chucked out and that might not even happen oh come off it harry said hermione angrily stopping dead in her track so that the people behind her had to swerve to avoid her of course he going to be chucked out and to be perfectly honest after what we have just seen who can blame umbridge there wa a pause in which harry glared at her and her eye filled slowly with tear you did not mean that said harry quietly no well all right i did not she said wiping her eye angrily but why doe he have to make life so difficult for himself for u page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i do not know weasley is our king weasley is our king he did not let the quaffle in weasley is our king and i wish they would stop singing that stupid song said hermione miserably have not they gloated enough a great tide of student wa moving up the sloping lawn from the pitch oh let u get in before we have to meet the slytherins said hermione weasley can save anything he never leaf a single ring that is why gryffindors all sing weasley is our king hermione said harry slowly the song wa growing louder but it wa issuing not from a crowd of greenandsilverclad slytherins but from a mass of red and gold moving slowly toward the castle which wa bearing a solitary figure upon it many shoulder weasley is our king weasley is our king he did not let the quaffle in weasley is our king no said hermione in a hushed voice yes said harry loudly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry hermione yelled ron waving the silver quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself we did it we won they beamed up at him a he passed there wa a scrum at the door of the castle and ron head got rather badly bumped on the lintel but nobody seemed to want to put him down still singing the crowd squeezed itself into the entrance hall and out of sight harry and hermione watched them go beaming until the last echoing strain of weasley is our king died away then they turned to each other their smile fading well save our news till tomorrow shall we said harry yes all right said hermione wearily i am not in any hurry they climbed the step together at the front door both instinctively looked back at the forbidden forest harry wa not sure whether it wa his imagination or not but he rather thought he saw a small cloud of bird erupting into the air over the treetop in the distance almost a though the tree in which they had been nesting had just been pulled up by the root page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling owl ron euphoria at helping gryffindor scrape the quidditch cup wa such that he could not settle to anything next day all he wanted to do wa talk over the match and harry and hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention grawp not that either of them tried very hard neither wa keen to be the one to bring ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion a it wa another fine warm day they persuaded him to join them in studying under the beech tree on the edge of the lake where they stood le chance of being overheard than in the common room ron wa not particularly keen on this idea at first he wa thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by gryffindors walking past his chair not to mention the occasional outburst of weasley is our king but agreed after a while that some fresh air might do him good they spread their book out in the shade of the beech tree and sat down while ron talked them through his page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling first save of the match for what felt like the dozenth time well i mean id already let in that one of davy so i wa not feeling that confident but i do not know when bradley came toward me just out of nowhere i thought you can do this and i had about a second to decide which way to fly you know because he looked like he wa aiming for the right goal hoop my right obviously his left but i had a funny feeling that he wa feinting and so i took the chance and flew left his right i mean and well you saw what happened he concluded modestly sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them a bunch of gossiping thirdyear hufflepuffs had heard him and then when chamber came at me about five minute later what ron said stopping mid sentence at the look on harrys face why are you grinning i am not said harry quickly looking down at his transfiguration note and attempting to straighten his face the truth wa that ron had just reminded harry forcibly of another gryffindor quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree i am just glad we won that is all yeah said ron slowly savoring the word we won did you see the look on chang face when ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose i suppose she cried did she said harry bitterly well yeah more out of temper than anything though ron frowned slightly but you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground did not you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling er said harry well actually no ron said hermione with a heavy sigh putting down her book and looking at him apologetically a a matter of fact the only bit of the match harry and i saw wa davy first goal ron carefully ruffled hair seemed to wilt with disappointment you did not watch he said faintly looking from one to the other you did not see me make any of those save well no said hermione stretching out a placatory hand toward him but ron we did not want to leave we had to yeah said ron whose face wa growing rather red how come it wa hagrid said harry he decided to tell u why he been covered in injury ever since he got back from the giant he wanted u to go into the forest with him we had no choice you know how he get anyway the story wa told in five minute by the end of which ron indignation had been replaced by a look of total incredulity he brought one back and hid it in the forest yep said harry grimly no said ron a though by saying this he could make it untrue no he can not have page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well he ha said hermione firmly grawps about sixteen foot tall enjoys ripping up twentyfoot pine tree and know me she snorted a hermy ron gave a nervous laugh and hagrid want u to teach him english yeah said harry he lost his mind said ron in an almost awed voice yes said hermione irritably turning a page of intermediate transfiguration and glaring at a series of diagram showing an owl turning into a pair of opera glass yes i am starting to think he ha but unfortunately he made harry and me promise well you are just going to have to break your promise that is all said ron firmly i mean come on we have got exam and were about that far he held up his hand to show thumb and forefinger a millimeter apart from being chucked out a it is and anyway remember norbert remember aragog have we ever come off better for mixing with any of hagrid s monster mate i know it just that we promised said hermione in a small voice ron smoothed his hair flat again looking preoccupied well he sighed hagrid ha not been sacked yet ha he he hung on this long maybe hell hang on till the end of term and we will not have to go near grawp at all page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the castle ground were gleaming in the sunlight a though freshly painted the cloudless sky smiled at itself in the smoothly sparkling lake the satingreen lawn rippled occasionally in a gentle breeze june had arrived but to the fifth year this meant only one thing their owl were upon them at last their teacher were no longer setting them homework lesson were devoted to reviewing those topic their teacher thought most likely to come up in the exam the purposeful feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the owl from harrys mind though he did wonder occasionally during potion lesson whether lupin had ever told snape that he must continue giving harry occlumency tuition if he had then snape had ignored lupin a thoroughly a he wa now ignoring harry this suited harry very well he wa quite busy and tense enough without extra class with snape and to his relief hermione wa much too preoccupied these day to badger him about occlumency she wa spending a lot of time muttering to herself and had not laid out any elf clothes for day she wa not the only person acting oddly a the owl drew steadily nearer ernie macmillan had developed an irritating habit of interrogating people about their study habit how many hour dyou think you are doing a day he demanded of harry and ron a they queued outside herbology a manic gleam in his eye i do not know said ron a few more or le than eight le i spose said ron looking slightly alarmed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tm doing eight said ernie puffing out his chest eight or nine i am getting an hour in before breakfast every day eight my average i can do ten on a good weekend day i did nine and a half on monday not so good on tuesday only seven and a quarter then on wednesday harry wa deeply thankful that professor sprout ushered them into greenhouse three at that point forcing ernie to abandon his recital meanwhile draco malfoy had found a different way to induce panic of course it not what you know he wa heard to tell crabbe and goyle loudly outside potion a few day before the exam were to start it who you know now father been friendly with the head of the wizarding examination authority for year old griselda marchbanks we have had her round for dinner and everything do you think that is true hermione whispered to harry and ron looking frightened nothing we can do about it if it is said ron gloomily i do not think it true said neville quietly from behind them because griselda marchbanks is a friend of my gran and she is never mentioned the malfoys what is she like neville asked hermione at once is she strict bit like gran really said neville in a subdued voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling knowing her will not hurt your chance though will it ron told him encouragingly oh i do not think it will make any difference said neville still more miserably gran always telling professor marchbanks i am not a good a my dad well you saw what she is like at st mungos neville looked fixedly at the floor harry ron and hermione glanced at one another but did not know what to say it wa the first time that neville had acknowledged that they had met at the wizarding hospital meanwhile a flourishing blackmarket trade in aid to concentration mental agility and wakefulness had sprung up among the fifth and seventh year harry and ron were much tempted by the bottle of baruffios brain elixir offered to them by ravenclaw sixth year eddie carmichael who swore it wa solely responsible for the nine outstanding owl he had gained the previous summer and wa offering the whole pint for a mere twelve galleon ron assured harry he would reimburse him for his half the moment he left hogwarts and got a job but before they could close the deal hermione had confiscated the bottle from carmichael and poured the content down a toilet hermione we wanted to buy that shouted ron do not be stupid she snarled you might a well take harold dingle powdered dragon claw and have done with it dingle got powdered dragon claw said ron eagerly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling not anymore said hermione i confiscated that too none of these thing actually work you know dragon claw doe work said ron it supposed to be incredible really give your brain a boost you come over all cunning for a few hour hermione let me have a pinch go on it can not hurt this stuff can said hermione grimly i have had a look at it and it actually dried doxy droppings this information took the edge off harry and ron desire for brain stimulant they received their examination schedule and detail of the procedure for owl during their next transfiguration lesson a you can see professor mcgonagall told the class while they copied down the date and time of their exam from the blackboard your owl are spread over two successive week you will sit the theory exam in the morning and the practice in the afternoon your practical astronomy examination will of course take place at night now i must warn you that the most stringent anti cheating charm have been applied to your examination paper autoanswer quill are banned from the examination hall a are remembralls detachable cribbing cuff and self correcting ink every year i am afraid to say seems to harbor at least one student who think that he or she can get around the wizarding examination authority rule i can only hope that it is nobody in gryffindor our new headmistress professor mcgonagall pronounced the word with the same look on her face that aunt petunia had whenever she wa contemplating a particularly stubborn bit of dirt page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ha asked the head of house to tell their student that cheating will be punished most severely because of course your examination result will reflect upon the headmistress new regime at the school professor mcgonagall gave a tiny sigh harry saw the nostril of her sharp nose flare however that is no reason not to do your very best you have your own future to think about please professor said hermione her hand in the air when will we find out our result an owl will be sent to you some time in july said professor mcgonagall excellent said dean thomas in an audible whisper so we do not have to worry about it till the holiday harry imagined sitting in his bedroom in privet drive in six week time waiting for his owl result well he thought at least he would be sure of one bit of post next summer their first exam theory of charm wa scheduled for monday morning harry agreed to test hermione after lunch on sunday but regretted it almost at once she wa very agitated and kept snatching the book back from him to check that she had gotten the answer completely right finally hitting him hard on the nose with the sharp edge of achievement in charming why do not you just do it yourself he said firmly handing the book back to her his eye watering meanwhile ron wa reading two year of charm note with his finger in his ear his lip moving page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling soundlessly seamus wa lying flat on his back on the floor reciting the definition of a substantive charm while dean checked it against the standard book of spell grade and parvati and lavender who were practicing basic locomotion charm were making their pencil case race each other around the edge of the table dinner wa a subdued affair that night harry and ron did not talk much but ate with gusto having studied hard all day hermione on the other hand kept putting down her knife and fork and diving under the table for her bag from which she would seize a book to check some fact or figure ron wa just telling her that she ought to eat a decent meal or she would not sleep that night when her fork slid from her limp finger and landed with a loud tinkle on her plate oh my goodness she said faintly staring into the entrance hall is that them is that the examiner harry and ron whipped around on their bench through the door to the great hall they could see umbridge standing with a small group of ancient looking witch and wizard umbridge harry wa pleased to see looked rather nervous shall we go and have a closer look said ron harry and hermione nodded and they hastened toward the double door into the entrance hall slowing down a they stepped over the threshold to walk sedately past the examiner harry thought professor marchbanks must be the tiny stooped witch with a face so lined it looked a though it had been draped in cobweb umbridge wa speaking to her very deferentially professor marchbanks seemed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling to be a little deaf she wa answering umbridge very loudly considering that they were only a foot apart journey wa fine journey wa fine we have made it plenty of time before she said impatiently now i have not heard from dumbledore lately she added peering around the hall a though hopeful he might suddenly emerge from a broom cupboard no idea where he is i suppose none at all said umbridge shooting a malevolent look at harry ron and hermione who were now dawdling around the foot of the stair a ron pretended to do up his shoelace but i daresay the ministry of magic will track him down soon enough i doubt it shouted tiny professor marchbanks not if dumbledore doe not want to be found i should know examined him personally in transfiguration and charm when he did newt did thing with a wand id never seen before yes well said professor umbridge a harry ron and hermione dragged their foot up the marble staircase a slowly a they dared let me show you to the staffroom i daresay you would like a cup of tea after your journey it wa an uncomfortable sort of an evening everyone wa trying to do some lastminute studying but nobody seemed to be getting very far harry went to bed early but then lay awake for what felt like hour he remembered his career consultation and mcgonagalls furious declaration that she would help him become an auror if it wa the last thing she did he wished he had expressed a more achievable ambition now that exam time wa here he knew that he wa not the only one lying awake but none of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the others in the dormitory spoke and finally one by one they fell asleep none of the fifth year talked very much at breakfast next day either parvati wa practicing incantation under her breath while the salt cellar in front of her twitched hermione wa rereading achievement in charming so fast that her eye appeared blurred and neville kept dropping his knife and fork and knocking over the marmalade once breakfast wa over the fifth and seventh year milled around in the entrance hall while the other student went off to lesson then at halfpast nine they were called forward class by class to reenter the great hall which wa now arranged exactly a harry had seen it in the pensieve when his father sirius and snape had been taking their owl the four house table had been removed and replaced instead with many table for one all facing the stafftable end of the hall where professor mcgonagall stood facing them when they were all seated and quiet she said you may begin and turned over an enormous hourglass on the desk beside her on which were also spare quill ink bottle and roll of parchment harry turned over his paper his heart thumping hard three row to his right and four seat ahead hermione wa already scribbling he lowered his eye to the first question a give the incantation and b describe the wand movement required to make object fly harry had a fleeting memory of a club soaring high into the air and landing loudly on the thick skull of a troll smiling slightly he bent over the paper and began to write page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well it wa not too bad wa it asked hermione anxiously in the entrance hall two hour later still clutching the exam paper i am not sure i did myself justice on cheering charm i just ran out of time did you put in the countercharm for hiccup i wa not sure whether i ought to it felt like too much and on question twentythree hermione said ron sternly we have been through this before were not going through every exam afterward it bad enough doing them once the fifth year ate lunch with the rest of the school the four house table reappeared over the lunch hour and then trooped off into the small chamber beside the great hall where they were to wait until called for their practical examination a small group of student were called forward in alphabetical order those left behind muttered incantation and practiced wand movement occasionally poking one another in the back or eye by mistake hermiones name wa called trembling she left the chamber with anthony goldstein gregory goyle and daphne greengrass student who had already been tested did not return afterward so harry and ron had no idea how hermione had done she will be fine remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our charm test said ron ten minute later professor flitwick called parkinson pansy patil padma patil parvati potter harry good luck said ron quietly harry walked into the great hall clutching his wand so tightly his hand shook page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling professor tofty is free potter squeaked professor flitwick who wa standing just inside the door he pointed harry toward what looked like the very oldest and baldest examiner who wa sitting behind a small table in a far corner a short distance from professor marchbanks who wa halfway through testing draco malfoy potter is it said professor tofty consulting his note and peering over his pincenez at harry a he approached the famous potter out of the corner of his eye harry distinctly saw malfoy throw a scathing look over at him the wine glass malfoy had been levitating fell to the floor and smashed harry could not suppress a grin professor tofty smiled back at him encouragingly that is it he said in his quavery old voice no need to be nervous now if i could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some cartwheel for me on the whole harry thought it went rather well his levitation charm wa certainly much better than malfoys had been though he wished he had not mixed up the incantation for color change and growth charm so that the rat he wa supposed to be turning orange swelled shockingly and wa the size of a badger before harry could rectify his mistake he wa glad hermione had not been in the hall at the time and neglected to mention it to her afterward he could tell ron though ron had caused a dinner plate to mutate into a large mushroom and had no idea how it had happened there wa no time to relax that night they went straight to the common room after dinner and submerged themselves in studying for transfiguration page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling next day harry went to bed his head buzzing with complex spell model and theory he forgot the definition of a switching spell during his written exam next morning but thought his practical could have been a lot worse at least he managed to vanish the whole of his iguana whereas poor hannah abbott lost her head completely at the next table and somehow managed to multiply her ferret into a flock of flamingo causing the examination to be halted for ten minute while the bird were captured and carried out of the hall they had their herbology exam on wednesday other than a small bite from a fanged geranium harry felt he had done reasonably well and then on thursday defense against the dark art here for the first time harry felt sure he had passed he had no problem with any of the written question and took particular pleasure during the practical examination in performing all the counterjinxes and defensive spell right in front of umbridge who wa watching coolly from near the door into the entrance hall oh bravo cried professor tofty who wa examining harry again when harry demonstrated a perfect boggart banishing spell very good indeed well i think that is all potter unless he leaned forward a little i heard from my dear friend tiberius ogden that you can produce a patronus for a bonus point harry raised his wand looked directly at umbridge and imagined her being sacked expecto patronum page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the silver stag erupted from the end of his wand and cantered the length of the hall all of the examiner looked around to watch it progress and when it dissolved into silver mist professor tofty clapped his veined and knotted hand enthusiastically excellent he said very well potter you may go a harry passed umbridge beside the door their eye met there wa a nasty smile playing around her wide slack mouth but he did not care unless he wa very much mistaken and he wa not planning on saying it to anybody in case he wa he had just achieved an outstanding owl on friday harry and ron had a day off while hermione sat her ancient rune exam and a they had the whole weekend in front of them they permitted themselves a break from studying they stretched and yawned beside the open window through which warm summer air wafted over them a they played a desultory game of wizard chess harry could see hagrid in the distance teaching a class on the edge of the forest he wa trying to guess what creature they were examining he thought it must be unicorn because the boy seemed to be standing back a little when the portrait hole opened and hermione clambered in looking thoroughly bad tempered how were the rune said ron yawning and stretching i mistranslated ehwaz said hermione furiously it mean partnership not defense i mixed it up with eihwaz ah well said ron lazily that is only one mistake is not it you will still get page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh shut up said hermione angrily it could be the one mistake that make the difference between a pas and a fail and what is more someone is put another niffler in umbridges office i do not know how they got it through that new door but i just walked past there and umbridge is shrieking her head off by the sound of it it tried to take a chunk out of her leg good said harry and ron together it is not good said hermione hotly she think it hagrid doing it remember and we do not want hagrid chucked out he teaching at the moment she can not blame him said harry gesturing out of the window oh you are so naive sometimes harry you really think umbridge will wait for proof said hermione who seemed determined to be in a towering temper and she swept off toward the girl dormitory banging the door behind her such a lovely sweettempered girl said ron very quietly prodding his queen forward so that she could begin beating up one of harrys knight hermione s bad mood persisted for most of the weekend though harry and ron found it quite easy to ignore a they spent most of saturday and sunday studying for potion on monday the exam to which harry wa looking forward least and which he wa sure would be the one that would be the downfall of his ambition to become an auror sure enough he found the written exam difficult though he thought he might have got full mark on the question about polyjuice potion he could describe it effect extremely accurately having taken it illegally in his second year page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the afternoon practical wa not a dreadful a he had expected it to be with snape absent from the proceeding he found that he wa much more relaxed than he usually wa while making potion neville who wa sitting very near harry also looked happier than harry had ever seen him during a potion class when professor marchbanks said step away from your cauldron please the examination is over harry corked his sample flask feeling that he might not have achieved a good grade but that he had with luck avoided a fail only four exam left said parvati patil wearily a they headed back to gryffindor common room only said hermione snappishly i have got arithmancy and it probably the toughest subject there is nobody wa foolish enough to snap back so she wa unable to vent her spleen on any of them and wa reduced to telling off some first year for giggling too loudly in the common room harry wa determined to perform well in tuesday care of magical creature exam so a not to let hagrid down the practical examination took place in the afternoon on the lawn on the edge of the forbidden forest where student were required to correctly identify the knarl hidden among a dozen hedgehog the trick wa to offer them all milk in turn knarls highly suspicious creature whose quill had many magical property generally went berserk at what they saw a an attempt to poison them then demonstrate correct handling of a bowtruckle feed and clean a firecrab without sustaining serious burn and choose from a wide selection of food the diet they would give a sick unicorn page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry could see hagrid watching anxiously out of his cabin window when harrys examiner a plump little witch this time smiled at him and told him he could leave harry gave hagrid a fleeting thumbsup before heading back up to the castle the astronomy theory exam on wednesday morning went well enough harry wa not convinced he had got the name of all of jupiter moon right but wa at least confident that none of them wa inhabited by mouse they had to wait until evening for their practical astronomy the afternoon wa devoted instead to divination even by harrys low standard in divination the exam went very badly he might a well have tried to see moving picture in the desktop a in the stubbornly blank crystal ball he lost his head completely during tealeaf reading saying it looked to him a though professor marchbanks would shortly be meeting a round dark soggy stranger and rounded off the whole fiasco by mixing up the life and head line on her palm and informing her that she ought to have died the previous tuesday well we were always going to fail that one said ron gloomily a they ascended the marble staircase he had just made harry feel rather better by telling him how he told the examiner in detail about the ugly man with a wart on his nose in his crystal ball only to look up and realize he had been describing his examiner reflection we should not have taken the stupid subject in the first place said harry still at least we can give it up now page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah said harry no more pretending we care what happens when jupiter and uranus get too friendly and from now on i do not care if my tea leaf spell die ron die i am just chucking them in the bin where they belong harry laughed just a hermione came running up behind them he stopped laughing at once in case it annoyed her well i think i have done all right in arithmancy she said and harry and ron both sighed with relief just time for a quick look over our star chart before dinner then when they reached the top of the astronomy tower at eleven of the clock they found a perfect night for stargazing cloudless and still the ground were bathed in silvery moonlight and there wa a slight chill in the air each of them set up his or her telescope and when professor marchbanks gave the word proceeded to fill in the blank star chart he or she had been given professor marchbanks and tofty strolled among them watching a they entered the precise position of the star and planet they were observing all wa quiet except for the rustle of parchment the occasional creak of a telescope a it wa adjusted on it stand and the scribbling of many quill half an hour passed then an hour the little square of reflected gold light flickering on the ground below started to vanish a light in the castle window were extinguished a harry completed the constellation orion on his chart however the front door of the castle opened directly below the parapet where he wa standing so page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling that light spilled down the stone step a little way across the lawn harry glanced down a he made a slight adjustment to the position of his telescope and saw five or six elongated shadow moving over the brightly lit grass before the door swung shut and the lawn became a sea of darkness once more harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it now examining venus he looked down at his chart to enter the planet there but something distracted him pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment he squinted down into the shadowy ground and saw half a dozen figure walking over the lawn if they had not been moving and the moonlight had not been gilding the top of their head they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they stood even at this distance harry had a funny feeling that he recognized the walk of the squattest among them who seemed to be leading the group he could not think why umbridge would be taking a stroll outside past midnight much le accompanied by five others then somebody coughed behind him and he remembered that he wa halfway through an exam he had quite forgotten venus position jamming his eye to his telescope he found it again and wa again on the point of entering it on his chart when alert for any odd sound he heard a distant knock that echoed through the deserted ground followed immediately by the muffled barking of a large dog he looked up his heart hammering there were light on in hagrids window and the people he had observed crossing the lawn were now silhouetted against them the door opened and he distinctly saw six tiny but sharply defined figure walk over the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling threshold the door closed again and there wa silence harry felt very uneasy he glanced around to see whether ron or hermione had noticed what he had but professor marchbanks came walking behind him at that moment and not wanting to appear a though he wa sneaking look at anyone el work he hastily bent over his star chart and pretended to be adding note to it while really peering over the top of the parapet toward hagrids cabin figure were now moving across the cabin window temporarily blocking the light he could feel professor marchbankss eye on the back of his neck and pressed his eye again to his telescope staring up at the moon though he had marked it position an hour ago but a professor marchbanks moved on he heard a roar from the distant cabin that echoed through the darkness right to the top of the astronomy tower several of the people around harry ducked out from behind their telescope and peered instead in the direction of hagrids cabin professor tofty gave another dry little cough try and concentrate now boy and girl he said softly most people returned to their telescope harry looked to his left hermione wa gazing transfixed at hagrids ahem twenty minute to go said professor tofty hermione jumped and returned at once to her star chart harry looked down at his own and noticed that page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he had mislabelled venus a mar he bent to correct it there wa a loud bang from the ground several people said ouch a they poked themselves in the face with the end of their telescope hastening to see what wa going on below hagrids door had burst open and by the light flooding out of the cabin they saw him quite clearly a massive figure roaring and brandishing his fist surrounded by six people all of whom judging by the tiny thread of red light they were casting in his direction seemed to be attempting to stun him no cried hermione my dear said professor tofty in a scandalized voice this is an examination but nobody wa paying the slightest attention to their star chart anymore jet of red light were still flying beside hagrids cabin yet somehow they seemed to be bouncing off him he wa still upright and still a far a harry could see fighting cry and yell echoed across the ground a man yelled be reasonable hagrid and hagrid roared reasonable be damned yeh won take me like this dawlish harry could see the tiny outline of fang attempting to defend hagrid leaping at the wizard surrounding him until a stunning spell caught him and he fell to the ground hagrid gave a howl of fury lifted the culprit bodily from the ground and threw him the man flew what looked like ten foot and did not get up again hermione gasped both hand over her mouth harry looked around at ron and saw that he too wa looking scared none of them had ever seen hagrid in a real temper before page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling look squealed parvati who wa leaning over the parapet and pointing to the foot of the castle where the front door seemed to have opened again more light had spilled out onto the dark lawn and a single long black shadow wa now rippling across the lawn now really said professor tofty anxiously only sixteen minute left you know but nobody paid him the slightest attention they were watching the person now sprinting toward the battle beside hagrids cabin how dare you the figure shouted a she ran how dare you it mcgonagall whispered hermione leave him alone alone i say said professor mcgonagalls voice through the darkness on what ground are you attacking him he ha done nothing nothing to warrant such hermione parvati and lavender all screamed no fewer than four stunner had shot from the figure around the cabin toward professor mcgonagall halfway between cabin and castle the red beam collided with her for a moment she looked luminous illuminated by an eerie red glow then wa lifted right off her foot landed hard on her back and moved no more galloping gargoyle shouted professor tofty who seemed to have forgotten the exam completely not so much a a warning outrageous behavior coward bellowed hagrid his voice carrying clearly to the top of the tower and several light page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling flickered back on inside the castle ruddy coward have some o that an that oh my gasped hermione hagrid took two massive swipe at his closest attacker judging by their immediate collapse they had been knocked cold harry saw him double over and thought for a moment that he had finally been overcome by a spell but on the contrary next moment hagrid wa standing again with what appeared to be a sack on his back then harry realized that fang limp body wa draped around his shoulder get him get him screamed umbridge but her remaining helper seemed highly reluctant to go within reach of hagrid s fist indeed he wa backing away so fast he tripped over one of his unconscious colleague and fell over hagrid had turned and begun to run with fang still hung around his neck umbridge sent one last stunning spell after him but it missed and hagrid running fullpelt toward the distant gate disappeared into the darkness there wa a long minute quivering silence everybody gazing openmouthed into the ground then professor toftys voice said feebly um five minute to go everybody though he had only filled in twothirds of his chart harry wa desperate for the end of the exam when it came at last he ron and hermione forced their telescope haphazardly back into their holder and dashed back down the spiral staircase none of the student were going to bed they were all talking loudly and excitedly at the foot of the stair about what they had witnessed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling that evil woman gasped hermione who seemed to be having difficulty talking due to rage trying to sneak up on hagrid in the dead of night she clearly wanted to avoid another scene like trelawneys said ernie macmillan sagely squeezing over to join them hagrid did well did not he said ron who looked more alarmed than impressed how come all the spell bounced off him it will be his giant blood said hermione shakily it very hard to stun a giant they are like troll really tough but poor professor mcgonagall four stunner straight in the chest and she is not exactly young is she dreadful dreadful said ernie shaking his head pompously well i am off to bed night all people around them were drifting away still talking excitedly about what they had just seen at least they did not get to take hagrid off to azkaban said ron i spect he gone to join dumbledore ha not he i suppose so said hermione who looked tearful oh this is awful i really thought dumbledore would be back before long but now we have lost hagrid too they traipsed back to the gryffindor common room to find it full the commotion out in the ground had woken several people who had hastened to rouse their friend seamus and dean who had arrived ahead of harry ron and hermione were now telling everyone what they had heard from the top of the astronomy tower page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but why sack hagrid now asked angelina johnson shaking her head it not like trelawney he been teaching much better than usual this year umbridge hate parthumans said hermione bitterly flopping down into an armchair she wa always going to try and get hagrid out and she thought hagrid wa putting nifflers in her office piped up katie bell oh blimey said lee jordan covering his mouth it me been putting the nifflers in her office fred and george left me a couple i have been levitating them in through her window she would have sacked him anyway said dean he wa too close to dumbledore that is true said harry sinking into an armchair beside hermione s i just hope professor mcgonagalls all right said lavender tearfully they carried her back up to the castle we watched through the dormitory window said colin creevey she did not look very well madam pomfrey will sort her out said alicia spinnet firmly she is never failed yet it wa nearly four in the morning before the common room cleared harry felt wide awake the image of hagrid sprinting away into the dark wa haunting him he wa so angry with umbridge he could not think of a punishment bad enough for her though ron suggestion of having her fed to a box of starving blastended skrewts had it merit he fell asleep page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling contemplating hideous revenge and arose from bed three hour later feeling distinctly unrested their final exam history of magic wa not to take place until that afternoon harry would very much have liked to go back to bed after breakfast but he had been counting on the morning for a spot of last minute studying so instead he sat with his head in his hand by the common room window trying hard not to doze off a he read through some of the note stacked threeandahalf foot high that hermione had lent him the fifth year entered the great hall at two of the clock and took their place in front of their overturned examination paper harry felt exhausted he just wanted this to be over so that he could go and sleep then tomorrow he and ron were going to go down to the quidditch pitch he wa going to have a fly on ron broom and savor their freedom from studying turn over your paper said professor marchbanks from the front of the hall flicking over the giant hourglass you may begin harry stared fixedly at the first question it wa several second before it occurred to him that he had not taken in a word of it there wa a wasp buzzing distractingly against one of the high window slowly tortuously he began to write an answer he wa finding it very difficult to remember name and kept confusing date he simply skipped question four in your opinion did wand legislation contribute to or lead to better control of goblin riot of the eighteenth century thinking that he would go back to it if he had time at the end he had a stab at question five how wa the statute of secrecy breached in and what measure were introduced to prevent a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling recurrence but had a nagging suspicion that he had missed several important point he had a feeling vampire had come into the story somewhere he looked ahead for a question he could definitely answer and his eye alighted upon number ten describe the circumstance that led to the formation of the international confederation of wizard and explain why the warlock of liechtenstein refused to join i know this harry thought though his brain felt torpid and slack he could visualize a heading in hermiones handwriting the formation of the international confederation of wizard he had read these note only this morning he began to write looking up now and again to check the large hourglass on the desk beside professor marchbanks he wa sitting right behind parvati patil whose long dark hair fell below the back of her chair once or twice he found himself staring at the tiny golden light that glistened in it when she moved her head very slightly and had to give his own head a little shake to clear it the first supreme mugwump of the international confederation of wizard wa pierre bonaccord but his appointment wa contested by the wizarding community of liechtenstein because all around harry quill were scratching on parchment like scurrying burrowing rat the sun wa very hot on the back of his head what wa it that bonaccord had done to offend the wizard of liechtenstein harry had a feeling it had something to do with troll he gazed blankly at the back of parvati s head again if he could only perform legilimency and open page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a window in the back of her head and see what it wa about troll that had caused the breach between pierre bonaccord and liechtenstein harry closed his eye and buried his face in his hand so that the glowing red of his eyelid grew dark and cool bonaccord had wanted to stop troll hunting and give the troll right but liechtenstein wa having problem with a tribe of particularly vicious mountain troll that wa it he opened his eye they stung and watered at the sight of the blazing white parchment slowly he wrote two line about the troll then read through what he had done so far it did not seem very informative or detailed yet he wa sure hermiones note on the confederation had gone on for page and page he closed his eye again trying to see them trying to remember the confederation had met for the first time in france yes he had written that already goblin had tried to attend and been ousted he had written that too and nobody from liechtenstein had wanted to come think he told himself his face in his hand while all around him quill scratched out neverending answer and the sand trickled through the hourglass at the front he wa walking along the cool dark corridor to the department of mystery again walking with a firm and purposeful tread breaking occasionally into a run determined to reach his destination at last the black door swung open for him a usual and here he wa in the circular room with it many door page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling straight across the stone floor and through the second door patch of dancing light on the wall and floor and that odd mechanical clicking but no time to explore he must hurry he jogged the last few foot to the third door which swung open just like the others once again he wa in the cathedralsized room full of shelf and glass sphere his heart wa beating very fast now he wa going to get there this time when he reached number ninetyseven he turned left and hurried along the aisle between two row but there wa a shape on the floor at the very end a black shape moving upon the floor like a wounded animal harrys stomach contracted with fear with excitement a voice issued from his own mouth a high cold voice empty of any human kindness take it for me lift it down now i can not touch it but you can the black shape upon the floor shifted a little harry saw a longfingered white hand clutching a wand rise on the end of his own arm heard the high cold voice say cruciol the man on the floor let out a scream of pain attempted to stand but fell back writhing harry wa laughing he raised his wand the curse lifted and the figure groaned and became motionless lord voldemort is waiting very slowly his arm trembling the man on the ground raised his shoulder a few inch and lifted his head his face wa bloodstained and gaunt twisted in pain yet rigid with defiance page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you will have to kill me whispered sirius undoubtedly i shall in the end said the cold voice but you will fetch it for me first black you think you have felt pain thus far think again we have hour ahead of u and nobody to hear you scream but somebody screamed a voldemort lowered his wand again somebody yelled and fell sideways off a hot desk onto the cold stone floor harry hit the ground and awoke still yelling his scar on fire a the great hall erupted all around him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling out of the fire i am not going i do not need the hospital wing i do not want he wa gibbering trying to pull away from professor tofty who wa looking at him with much concern and who had just helped harry out into the entrance hall while the student all around them stared i am i am fine sir harry stammered wiping the sweat from his face really i just fell asleep had a nightmare pressure of examination said the old wizard sympathetically patting harry shakily on the shoulder it happens young man it happens now a cooling drink of water and perhaps you will be ready to return to the great hall the examination is nearly over but you may be able to round off your last answer nicely yes said harry wildly i mean no i have done done a much a i can i think page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling very well very well said the old wizard gently i shall go and collect your examination paper and i suggest that you go and have a nice lie down ill do that said harry nodding vigorously thanks very much he waited for the second when the old man heel disappeared over the threshold into the great hall then ran up the marble staircase and then more staircase toward the hospital wing hurtling along the corridor so fast that the portrait he passed muttered reproach and burst through the double door like a hurricane causing madam pomfrey who had been spooning some bright blue liquid into montagues open mouth to shriek in alarm potter what do you think you are doing i need to see professor mcgonagall gasped harry the breath tearing his lung now it urgent she is not here potter said madam pomfrey sadly she wa transferred to st mungos this morning four stunning spell straight to the chest at her age it a wonder they did not kill her she is gone said harry stunned the bell rang just outside the dormitory and he heard the usual distant rumbling of student starting to flood out into the corridor above and below him he remained quite still looking at madam pomfrey terror wa rising inside him there wa nobody left to tell dumbledore had gone hagrid had gone but he had always expected professor mcgonagall to be there irascible and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling inflexible perhaps but always dependably solidly present i do not wonder you are shocked potter said madam pomfrey with a kind of fierce approval in her face a if one of them could have stunned minerva mcgonagall face on by daylight cowardice that is what it wa despicable cowardice if i wa not worried what would happen to you student without me id resign in protest yes said harry blankly he strode blindly from the hospital wing into the teeming corridor where he stood buffeted by the crowd the panic expanding inside him like poison gas so that his head swam and he could not think what to do ron and hermione said a voice in his head he wa running again pushing student out of the way oblivious to their angry protest and shout he sprinted back down two floor and wa at the top of the marble staircase when he saw them hurrying toward him harry said hermione at once looking very frightened what happened are you all right are you ill where have you been demanded ron come with me harry said quickly come on i have got to tell you something he led them along the firstfloor corridor peering through doorway and at last found an empty classroom into which he dived closing the door page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling behind ron and hermione the moment they were inside and leaning against it facing them voldemorts got sirius what how dyou saw it just now when i fell asleep in the exam but but where how said hermione whose face wa white i do not know how said harry but i know exactly where there is a room in the department of mystery full of shelf covered in these little glass ball and they are at the end of row ninetyseven he trying to use sirius to get whatever it is he want from in there he torturing him say hell end by killing him harry found his voice wa shaking a were his knee he moved over to a desk and sat down on it trying to master himself how are we going to get there he asked them there wa a moment silence then ron said gget there get to the department of mystery so we can rescue sirius harry said loudly but harry said ron weakly what what said harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he could not understand why they were both gaping at him a though he wa asking them something unreasonable harry said hermione in a rather frightened voice er how how did voldemort get into the ministry of magic without anybody realizing he wa there how do i know bellowed harry the question is how were going to get in there but harry think about this said hermione taking a step toward him it five of the clock in the afternoon the ministry of magic must be full of worker how would voldemort and sirius have got in without being seen harry they are probably the two most wanted wizard in the world you think they could get into a building full of aurors undetected i do not know voldemort used an invisibility cloak or something harry shouted anyway the department of mystery ha always been completely empty whenever i have been you have never been there harry said hermione quietly you have dreamed about the place that is all they are not normal dream harry shouted in her face standing up and taking a step closer to her in turn he wanted to shake her how dyou explain ron dad then what wa all that about how come i knew what had happened to him he got a point said ron quietly looking at hermione but this is just just so unlikely said hermione desperately harry how on earth could voldemort page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling have got hold of sirius when he been in grimmauld place all the time sirius might have cracked and just wanted some fresh air said ron sounding worried he been desperate to get out of that house for age but why hermione persisted why on earth would voldemort want to use sirius to get the weapon or whatever the thing is i do not know there could be load of reason harry yelled at her maybe sirius is just someone voldemort doe not care about seeing hurt you know what i have just thought of something said ron in a hushed voice sirius brother wa a death eater wa not he maybe he told sirius the secret of how to get the weapon yeah and that is why dumbledores been so keen to keep sirius locked up all the time said harry look i am sorry cried hermione but neither of you are making sense and we have got no proof for any of this no proof voldemort and sirius are even there hermione harrys seen them said ron rounding on her okay she said looking frightened yet determined i have just got to say this what you this is not a criticism harry but you do sort of i mean do not you think you have got a bit of a a savingpeoplething she said page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he glared at her and what is that supposed to mean a savingpeoplething well you she looked more apprehensive than ever i mean last year for instance in the lake during the tournament you should not have i mean you did not need to save that little delacour girl you got a bit carried away a wave of hot prickly anger swept harrys body how could she remind him of that blunder now i mean it wa really great of you and everything said hermione quickly looking positively petrified at the look on harrys face everyone thought it wa a wonderful thing to do that is funny said harry in a trembling voice because i definitely remember ron saying id wasted time acting the hero is that what you think this is you reckon i want to act the hero again no no no said hermione looking aghast that is not what i mean at all well spit out what you have got to say because were wasting time here harry shouted i am trying to say voldemort know you harry he took ginny down into the chamber of secret to lure you there it the kind of thing he doe he know you are the the sort of person who would go to sirius aid what if he just trying to get you into the department of myst hermione it doe not matter if he done it to get me there or not they have taken mcgonagall to st mungos there is not anyone left from the order at page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hogwarts who we can tell and if we do not go sirius is dead but harry what if your dream wa wa just that a dream harry let out a roar of frustration hermione actually stepped back from him looking alarmed you do not get it harry shouted at her i am not having nightmare i am not just dreaming what dyou think all the occlumency wa for why dyou think dumbledore wanted me prevented from seeing these thing because they are real hermione sirius is trapped i have seen him voldemorts got him and no one else know and that mean were the only one who can save him and if you do not want to do it fine but i am going understand and if i remember rightly you did not have a problem with my saving peoplething when it wa you i wa saving from the dementors or he rounded on ron when it wa your sister i wa saving from the basilisk i never said i had a problem said ron heatedly but harry you have just said it said hermione fiercely dumbledore wanted you to learn to shut these thing out of your mind if you would done occlumency properly you would never have seen this if you think i am just going to act like i haven t seen sirius told you there wa nothing more important than you learning to close your mind well i expect he would say something different if he knew what id just page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the classroom door opened harry ron and hermione whipped around ginny walked in looking curious followed by luna who a usual looked a though she had drifted in accidentally hi said ginny uncertainly we recognized harrys voice what are you yelling about never you mind said harry roughly ginny raised her eyebrow there is no need to take that tone with me she said coolly i wa only wondering whether i could help well you can not said harry shortly you are being rather rude you know said luna serenely harry swore and turned away the very last thing he wanted now wa a conversation with luna lovegood wait said hermione suddenly wait harry they can help harry and ron looked at her listen she said urgently harry we need to establish whether sirius really ha left headquarters i have told you i saw harry i am begging you please said hermione desperately please let u just check that sirius is not at home before we go charging off to london if we find out he not there then i swear i will not try and stop page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you ill come ill ddo whatever it take to try and save him sirius is being tortured now shouted harry we have not got time to waste but if this is a trick of vvoldemorts harry we have got to check we have got to how harry demanded how are we going to check well have to use umbridges fire and see if we can contact him said hermione who looked positively terrified at the thought well draw umbridge away again but well need lookout and that is where we can use ginny and luna though clearly struggling to understand what wa going on ginny said immediately yeah well do it and luna said when you say sirius are you talking about stubby boardman nobody answered her okay harry said aggressively to hermione okay if you can think of a way of doing this quickly i am with you otherwise i am going to the department of mystery right now the department of mystery said luna looking mildly surprised but how are you going to get there again harry ignored her right said hermione twisting her hand together and pacing up and down between the desk right well one of u ha to go and find umbridge and and send her off in the wrong direction keep her page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling away from her office they could tell her i do not know that peeve is up to something awful a usual ill do it said ron at once ill tell her peeve is smashing up the transfiguration department or something it mile away from her office come to think of it i could probably persuade peeve to do it if i met him on the way it wa a mark of the seriousness of the situation that hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the transfiguration department okay she said her brow furrowed a she continued to pace now we need to keep student away from her office while we force entry or some slytherins bound to go and tip her off luna and i can stand at either end of the corridor said ginny promptly and warn people not to go down there because someone is let off a load of garroting gas hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which ginny had come up with this lie ginny shrugged and said fred and george were planning to do it before they left okay said hermione well then harry you and i will be under the invisibility cloak and well sneak into the office and you can talk to sirius he not there hermione i mean you can can check whether sirius is at home or not while i keep watch i do not think you should be in there alone lee already proved the window a weak spot sending those nifflers through it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling even through his anger and impatience harry recognized hermione s offer to accompany him into umbridges office a a sign of solidarity and loyalty i okay thanks he muttered right well even if we do all of that i do not think were going to be able to bank on more than five minute said hermione looking relieved that harry seemed to have accepted the plan not with filch and the wretched inquisitorial squad floating around five minutesll be enough said harry cmon let u go now said hermione looking shocked of course now said harry angrily what did you think were going to wait until after dinner or something hermione sirius is being tortured right now i oh all right she said desperately you go and get the invisibility cloak and well meet you at the end of umbridges corridor okay harry did not answer but flung himself out of the room and began to fight his way through the milling crowd outside two floor up he met seamus and dean who hailed him jovially and told him they were planning a dusktilldawn endofexams celebration in the common room harry barely heard them he scrambled through the portrait hole while they were still arguing about how many blackmarket butterbeers they would need and wa climbing back out of it the invisibility cloak and sirius knife secure in his bag before they noticed he had left them page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry dyou want to chip in a couple of galleon harold dingle reckons he could sell u some firewhisky but harry wa already tearing away back along the corridor and a couple of minute later wa jumping the last few stair to join ron hermione ginny and luna who were huddled together at the end of umbridges corridor got it he panted ready to go then all right whispered hermione a a gang of loud sixth year passed them so ron you go and head umbridge off ginny luna if you can start moving people out of the corridor harry and i will get the cloak on and wait until the coast is clear ron strode away his bright red hair visible right to the end of the passage meanwhile ginnys equally vivid head bobbed between the jostling student surrounding them in the other direction trailed by luna blonde one get over here muttered hermione tugging at harrys wrist and pulling him back into a recess where the ugly stone head of a medieval wizard stood muttering to itself on a column are are you sure you are okay harry you are still very pale i am fine he said shortly tugging the invisibility cloak from out of his bag in truth his scar wa aching but not so badly that he thought voldemort had yet dealt sirius a fatal blow it had hurt much worse than this when voldemort had been punishing avery page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling here he said he threw the invisibility cloak over both of them and they stood listening carefully over the latin mumbling of the bust in front of them you can not come down here ginny wa calling to the crowd no sorry you are going to have to go round by the swiveling staircase someone is let off garroting gas just along here they could hear people complaining one surly voice said i can not see no gas that is because it colorless said ginny in a convincingly exasperated voice but if you want to walk through it carry on then well have your body a proof for the next idiot who did not believe u slowly the crowd thinned the news about the garroting gas seemed to have spread people were not coming this way anymore when at last the surrounding area wa quite clear hermione said quietly i think that is a good a were going to get harry come on let u do it together they moved forward covered by the cloak luna wa standing with her back to them at the far end of the corridor a they passed ginny hermione whispered good one do not forget the signal what is the signal muttered harry a they approached umbridges door a loud chorus of weasley is our king if they see umbridge coming replied hermione a harry inserted the blade of sirius knife in the crack between door and wall the lock clicked open and they entered the office page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the garish kitten were basking in the late afternoon sunshine warming their plate but otherwise the office wa a still and empty a last time hermione breathed a sigh of relief i thought she might have added extra security after the second niffler they pulled off the cloak hermione hurried over to the window and stood out of sight peering down into the ground with her wand out harry dashed over to the fireplace seized the pot of floo powder and threw a pinch into the grate causing emerald flame to burst into life there he knelt down quickly thrust his head into the dancing fire and cried number twelve grimmauld place his head began to spin a though he had just got off a fairground ride though his knee remained firmly planted upon the cold office floor he kept his eye screwed up against the whirling ash and when the spinning stopped he opened them to find himself looking out upon the long cold kitchen of grimmauld place there wa nobody there he had expected this yet wa not prepared for the molten wave of dread and panic that seemed to burst through his stomach floor at the sight of the deserted room sirius he shouted sirius are you there his voice echoed around the room but there wa no answer except a tiny scuffing sound to the right of the fire who is there he called wondering whether it wa just a mouse page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling kreacher the houseelf came creeping into view he looked highly delighted about something though he seemed to have recently sustained a nasty injury to both hand which were heavily bandaged it the potter boy head in the fire kreacher informed the empty kitchen stealing furtive oddly triumphant glance at harry what ha he come for kreacher wonder where is sirius kreacher harry demanded the houseelf gave a wheezy chuckle master ha gone out harry potter where is he gone where is he gone kreacher kreacher merely cackled i am warning you said harry fully aware that his scope for inflicting punishment upon kreacher wa almost nonexistent in this position what about lupin madeye any of them are any of them here nobody here but kreacher said the elf gleefully and turning away from harry he began to walk slowly toward the door at the end of the kitchen kreacher think he will have a little chat with his mistress now yes he ha not had a chance in a long time kreachers master ha been keeping him away from her where ha sirius gone harry yelled after the elf kreacher ha he gone to the department of mystery kreacher stopped in his track harry could just make out the back of his bald head through the forest of chair leg before him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling master doe not tell poor kreacher where he is going said the elf quietly but you know shouted harry do not you you know where he is there wa a moment silence then the elf let out his loudest cackle yet master will not come back from the department of mystery he said gleefully kreacher and his mistress are alone again and he scurried forward and disappeared through the door to the hall you but before he could utter a single curse or insult harry felt a great pain at the top of his head he inhaled a lot of ash and choking found himself being dragged backward through the flame until with a horrible abruptness he wa staring up into the wide pallid face of professor umbridge who had dragged him backward out of the fire by the hair and wa now bending his neck back a far a it would go a though she wa going to slit his throat you think she whispered bending harrys neck back even farther so that he wa looking up at the ceiling above him that after two nifflers i wa going to let one more foul scavenging little creature enter my office without my knowledge i had stealth sensoring spell placed all around my doorway after the last one got in you foolish boy take his wand she barked at someone he could not see and he felt a hand grope inside the chest pocket of his robe and remove the wand hers too page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry heard a scuffle over by the door and knew that hermione had just had her wand wrested from her a well i want to know why you are in my office said umbridge shaking the fist clutching his hair so that he staggered i wa trying to get my firebolt harry croaked liar she shook his head again your firebolt is under strict guard in the dungeon a you very well know potter you had your head in my fire with whom have you been communicating no one said harry trying to pull away from her he felt several hair part company with his scalp liaa shouted umbridge she threw him from her and he slammed into the desk now he could see hermione pinioned against the wall by millicent bulstrode malfoy wa leaning on the windowsill smirking a he threw harrys wand into the air one handed and then caught it again there wa a commotion outside and several large slytherins entered each gripping ron ginny luna and to harrys bewilderment neville who wa trapped in a stranglehold by crabbe and looked in imminent danger of suffocation all four of them had been gagged got them all said warrington shoving ron roughly forward into the room that one he poked a thick finger at neville tried to stop me taking her he pointed at ginny who wa trying to kick the shin of the large slytherin girl holding her so i brought him along too page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling good good said umbridge watching ginnys struggle well it look a though hogwarts will shortly be a weasleyfree zone doe not it malfoy laughed loudly and sycophantically umbridge gave her wide complacent smile and settled herself into a chintzcovered armchair blinking up at her captive like a toad in a flowerbed so potter she said you stationed lookout around my office and you sent this buffoon she nodded at ron and malfoy laughed even louder to tell me the poltergeist wa wreaking havoc in the transfiguration department when i knew perfectly well that he wa busy smearing ink on the eyepiece of all the school telescope mr filch having just informed me so clearly it wa very important for you to talk to somebody wa it albus dumbledore or the half breed hagrid i doubt it wa minerva mcgonagall i hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone malfoy and a few of the other member of the inquisitorial squad laughed some more at that harry found he wa so full of rage and hatred he wa shaking it none of your business who i talk to he snarled umbridges slack face seemed to tighten very well she said in her most dangerous and falsely sweet voice very well mr potter i offered you the chance to tell me freely you refused i have no alternative but to force you draco fetch professor snape malfoy stowed harrys wand inside his robe and left the room smirking but harry hardly noticed he had page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling just realized something he could not believe he had been so stupid a to forget it he had thought that all the member of the order all those who could help him save sirius were gone but he had been wrong there wa still a member of the order of the phoenix at hogwarts snape there wa silence in the office except for the fidgetings and scufflings resultant from the slytherins effort to keep ron and the others under control ron lip wa bleeding onto umbridges carpet a he struggled against warringtons half nelson ginny wa still trying to stamp on the foot of the sixthyear girl who had both her upper arm in a tight grip neville wa turning steadily more purple in the face while tugging at crabbes arm and hermione wa attempting vainly to throw millicent bulstrode off her luna however stood limply by the side of her captor gazing vaguely out of the window a though rather bored by the proceeding harry looked back at umbridge who wa watching him closely he kept his face deliberately smooth and blank a footstep were heard in the corridor outside and draco malfoy came back into the room holding open the door for snape you wanted to see me headmistress said snape looking around at all the pair of struggling student with an expression of complete indifference ah professor snape said umbridge smiling widely and standing up again yes i would like another bottle of veritaserum a quick a you can please you took my last bottle to interrogate potter he said observing her coolly through his greasy curtain of black hair surely you did not use it all i told you that three drop would be sufficient page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling umbridge flushed you can make some more can not you she said her voice becoming more sweetly girlish a it always did when she wa furious certainly said snape his lip curling it take a full moon cycle to mature so i should have it ready for you in around a month a month squawked umbridge swelling toadishly a month but i need it this evening snape i have just found potter using my fire to communicate with a person or person unknown really said snape showing his first faint sign of interest a he looked around at harry well it doe not surprise me potter ha never shown much inclination to follow school rule his cold dark eye were boring into harrys who met his gaze unflinchingly concentrating hard on what he had seen in his dream willing snape to read it in his mind to understand i wish to interrogate him shouted umbridge angrily and snape looked away from harry back into her furiously quivering face i wish you to provide me with a potion that will force him to tell me the truth i have already told you said snape smoothly that i have no further stock of veritaserum unless you wish to poison potter and i assure you i would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did i can not help you the only trouble is that most venom act too fast to give the victim much time for truthtelling page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling snape looked back at harry who stared at him frantic to communicate without word voldemorts got sirius in the department of mystery he thought desperately voldemorts got sirius you are on probation shrieked professor umbridge and snape looked back at her his eyebrow slightly raised you are being deliberately unhelpful i expected better lucius malfoy always speaks most highly of you now get out of my office snape gave her an ironic bow and turned to leave harry knew his last chance of letting the order know what wa going on wa walking out of the door he got padfoot he shouted he got padfoot at the place where it hidden snape had stopped with his hand on umbridges door handle padfoot cried professor umbridge looking eagerly from harry to snape what is padfoot where what is hidden what doe he mean snape snape looked around at harry his face wa inscrutable harry could not tell whether he had understood or not but he did not dare speak more plainly in front of umbridge i have no idea said snape coldly potter when i want nonsense shouted at me i shall give you a babbling beverage and crabbe loosen your hold a little if longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork and i am afraid i shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he closed the door behind him with a snap leaving harry in a state of worse turmoil than before snape had been his very last hope he looked at umbridge who seemed to be feeling the same way her chest wa heaving with rage and frustration very well she said and she pulled out her wand very well i am left with no alternative this is more than a matter of school discipline this is an issue of ministry security yes yes she seemed to be talking herself into something she wa shifting her weight nervously from foot to foot staring at harry beating her wand against her empty palm and breathing heavily harry felt horribly powerless without his own wand a he watched her you are forcing me potter i do not want to said umbridge still moving restlessly on the spot but sometimes circumstance justify the use i am sure the minister will understand that i had no choice malfoy wa watching her with a hungry expression on his face the cruciatus curse ought to loosen your tongue said umbridge quietly no shrieked hermione professor umbridge it illegal but umbridge took no notice there wa a nasty eager excited look on her face that harry had never seen before she raised her wand the minister would not want you to break the law professor umbridge cried hermione what cornelius doe not know will not hurt him said umbridge who wa now panting slightly a she pointed her wand at different part of harrys body in page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling turn apparently trying to decide what would hurt the most he never knew i ordered dementors after potter last summer but he wa delighted to be given the chance to expel him all the same it wa you gasped harry you sent the dementors after me somebody had to act breathed umbridge a her wand came to rest pointing directly at harrys forehead they were all bleating about silencing you somehow discrediting you but i wa the one who actually did something about it only you wriggled out of that one did not you potter not today though not now and taking a deep breath she cried cruc no shouted hermione in a cracked voice from behind millicent bulstrode no harry harry well have to tell her no way yelled harry staring at the little of hermione he could see well have to harry she will force it out of you anyway what is what is the point and hermione began to cry weakly into the back of millicent bulstrode s robe millicent stopped trying to squash her against the wall immediately and dodged out of her way looking disgusted well well well said umbridge looking triumphant little miss questionall is going to give u some answer come on then girl come on er my nee no shouted ron through his gag page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ginny wa staring at hermione a though she had never seen her before neville still choking for breath wa gazing at her too but harry had just noticed something though hermione wa sobbing desperately into her hand there wa no trace of a tear i am i am sorry everyone said hermione but i can not stand it that is right that is right girl said umbridge seizing hermione by the shoulder thrusting her into the abandoned chintz chair and leaning over her now then with whom wa potter communicating just now well gulped hermione into her hand well he wa trying to speak to professor dumbledore ron froze his eye wide ginny stopped trying to stamp on her slytherin captor toe even luna looked mildly surprised fortunately the attention of umbridge and her minion wa focused too exclusively upon hermione to notice these suspicious sign dumbledore said umbridge eagerly you know where dumbledore is then well no sobbed hermione we have tried the leaky cauldron in diagon alley and the three broomstick and even the hog head idiot girl dumbledore will not be sitting in a pub when the whole ministry looking for him shouted umbridge disappointment etched in every sagging line of her face page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but but we needed to tell him something important wailed hermione holding her hand more tightly over her face not harry knew out of anguish but to disguise the continued absence of tear yes said umbridge with a sudden resurgence of excitement what wa it you wanted to tell him we we wanted to tell him it rready choked hermione what is ready demanded umbridge and now she grabbed hermione s shoulder again and shook her slightly what is ready girl the the weapon said hermione weapon weapon said umbridge and her eye seemed to pop with excitement you have been developing some method of resistance a weapon you could use against the ministry on professor dumbledores order of course yyyes gasped hermione but he had to leave before it wa finished and nnnow we have finished it for him and we cccant find him ttto tell him what kind of weapon is it said umbridge harshly her stubby hand still tight on hermione s shoulder we do not rrreally understand it said hermione sniffing loudly we jjjust did what ppprofessor dumbledore told u ttto do umbridge straightened up looking exultant lead me to the weapon she said page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tm not showing them said hermione shrilly looking around at the slytherins through her finger it is not for you to set condition said professor umbridge harshly fine said hermione now sobbing into her hand again fine let them see it i hope they use it on you in fact i wish you would invite load and load of people to come and see ththat would serve you right oh id love it if the whwhole school knew where it wa and how to uuse it and then if you annoy any of them they will be able to ssort you out these word had a powerful impact on umbridge she glanced swiftly and suspiciously around at her inquisitorial squad her bulging eye resting for a moment on malfoy who wa too slow to disguise the look of eagerness and greed that had appeared on his face umbridge contemplated hermione for another long moment and then spoke in what she clearly thought wa a motherly voice all right dear let u make it just you and me and well take potter too shall we get up now professor said malfoy eagerly professor umbridge i think some of the squad should come with you to look after i am a fully qualified ministry official malfoy do you really think i can not manage two wandless teenager alone asked umbridge sharply in any case it doe not sound a though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see you will remain here until i return and make sure none of these she gestured around at ron ginny neville and luna escape page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling all right said malfoy looking sulky and disappointed and you two can go ahead of me and show me the way said umbridge pointing at harry and hermione with her wand lead on page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fight and flight harry had no idea what hermione wa planning or even whether she had a plan he walked half a pace behind her a they headed down the corridor outside umb ridge office knowing it would look very suspicious if he appeared not to know where they were going he did not dare attempt to talk to her umbridge wa walking so closely behind them that he could hear her ragged breathing hermione led the way down the stair into the entrance hall the din of loud voice and the clatter of cutlery on plate echoed from out of the double door to the great hall it seemed incredible to harry that twenty foot away were people who were enjoying dinner celebrating the end of exam not a care in the world hermione walked straight out of the oak front door and down the stone step into the balmy evening air the sun wa falling toward the top of the tree in the forbidden forest now a hermione marched purposefully across the grass umbridge jogging to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling keep up their long dark shadow rippled over the grass behind them like cloak it hidden in hagrids hut is it said umbridge eagerly in harrys ear of course not said hermione scathingly hagrid might have set it off accidentally yes said umbridge whose excitement seemed to be mounting yes he would have done of course the great halfbreed oaf she laughed harry felt a strong urge to swing around and seize her by the throat but resisted his scar wa throbbing in the soft evening air but it had not yet burned whitehot a he knew it would if voldemort had moved in for the kill then where is it asked umbridge with a hint of uncertainty in her voice a hermione continued to stride toward the forest in there of course said hermione pointing into the dark tree it had to be somewhere that student were not going to find it accidentally did not it of course said umbridge though she sounded a little apprehensive now of course very well then you two stay ahead of me can we have your wand then if were going first harry asked her no i do not think so mr potter said umbridge sweetly poking him in the back with it the ministry place a rather higher value on my life than yours i am afraid page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a they reached the cool shade of the first tree harry tried to catch hermione s eye walking into the forest without wand seemed to him to be more foolhardy than anything they had done so far this evening she however merely gave umbridge a contemptuous glance and plunged straight into the tree moving at such a pace that umbridge with her shorter leg had difficulty in keeping up is it very far in umbridge asked a her robe ripped on a bramble oh yes said hermione yes it well hidden harrys misgiving increased hermione wa not taking the path they had followed to visit grawp but the one he had followed three year ago to the lair of the monster aragog hermione had not been with him on that occasion he doubted she had any idea what danger lay at the end of it er are you sure this is the right way he asked her pointedly oh yes she said in a steely voice crashing through the undergrowth with what he thought wa a wholly unnecessary amount of noise behind them umbridge tripped over a fallen sapling neither of them paused to help her up again hermione merely strode on calling loudly over her shoulder it a bit further in hermione keep your voice down harry muttered hurrying to catch up with her anything could be listening in here i want u heard she answered quietly a umbridge jogged noisily after them you will see page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they walked on for what seemed a long time until they were once again so deep into the forest that the dense tree canopy blocked out all light harry had the feeling he had had before in the forest one of being watched by unseen eye how much further demanded umbridge angrily from behind him not far now shouted hermione a they emerged into a dim dank clearing just a little bit an arrow flew through the air and landed with a menacing thud in the tree just over her head the air wa suddenly full of the sound of hoof harry could feel the forest floor trembling umbridge gave a little scream and pushed him in front of her like a shield he wrenched himself free of her and turned around fifty centaur were emerging on every side their bow raised and loaded pointing at harry hermione and umbridge who backed slowly into the center of the clearing umbridge uttering odd little whimper of terror harry looked sideways at hermione she wa wearing a triumphant smile who are you said a voice harry looked left the chestnutbodied centaur called magorian wa walking toward them out of the circle his bow like the others wa raised on harrys right umbridge wa still whimpering her wand trembling violently a she pointed it at the advancing centaur i asked you who are you human said magorian roughly i am dolores umbridge said umbridge in a high pitched terrified voice senior undersecretary to the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling minister of magic and headmistress and high inquisitor of hogwarts you are from the ministry of magic said magorian a many of the centaur in the surrounding circle shifted restlessly that is right said umbridge in an even higher voice so be very careful by the law laid down by the department for the regulation and control of magical creature any attack by halfbreeds such a yourselves on a human what did you call u shouted a wildlooking black centaur whom harry recognized a bane there wa a great deal of angry muttering and tightening of bowstring around them do not call them that hermione said furiously but umbridge did not appear to have heard her still pointing her shaking wand at magorian she continued law fifteen b state clearly that any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have nearhuman intelligence and therefore considered responsible for it action nearhuman intelligence repeated magorian a bane and several others roared with rage and pawed the ground we consider that a great insult human our intelligence thankfully far outstrips your own what are you doing in our forest bellowed the hardfaced gray centaur whom harry and hermione had seen on their last trip into the forest why are you here your forest said umbridge shaking now not only with fright but also it seemed with indignation i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling would remind you that you live here only because the ministry of magic permit you certain area of land an arrow flew so close to her head that it caught at her mousy hair in passing she let out an earsplitting scream and threw her hand over her head while some of the centaur bellowed their approval and others laughed raucously the sound of their wild neighing laughter echoing around the dimly lit clearing and the sight of their pawing hoof wa extremely unnerving whose forest is it now human bellowed bane filthy halfbreeds she screamed her hand still tight over her head beast uncontrolled animal be quiet shouted hermione but it wa too late umbridge pointed her wand at magorian and screamed incarcerousl rope flew out of midair like thick snake wrapping themselves tightly around the centaur torso and trapping his arm he gave a cry of rage and reared onto his hind leg attempting to free himself while the other centaur charged harry grabbed hermione and pulled her to the ground facedown on the forest floor he knew a moment of terror a hoof thundered around him but the centaur leapt over and around them bellowing and screaming with rage nooooo he heard umbridge shriek noooooo i am senior undersecretary you can not unhand me you animal nooooo page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he saw a flash of red light and knew that she had attempted to stun one of them then she screamed very loudly lifting his head a few inch harry saw that umbridge had been seized from behind by bane and lifted high into the air wriggling and yelling with fright her wand fell from her hand to the ground and harrys heart leapt if he could just reach it but a he stretched out a hand toward it a centaur hoof descended upon the wand and it broke cleanly in half now roared a voice in harrys ear and a thick hairy arm descended from thin air and dragged him upright hermione too had been pulled to her foot over the plunging manycolored back and head of the centaur harry saw umbridge being borne away through the tree by bane still screaming nonstop her voice grew fainter and fainter until they could no longer hear it over the trampling of hoof surrounding them and these said the hardfaced gray centaur holding hermione they are young said a slow doleful voice from behind harry we do not attack foal they brought her here ronan replied the centaur who had such a firm grip on harry and they are not so young he is nearing manhood this one he shook harry by the neck of his robe please said hermione breathlessly please do not attack u we do not think like her we are not ministry of magic employee we only came in here because we hoped you would drive her off for u page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry knew at once from the look on the face of the gray centaur holding hermione that she had made a terrible mistake in saying this the gray centaur threw back his head his back leg stamping furiously and bellowed you see ronan they already have the arrogance of their kind so we were to do your dirty work were we human girl we were to act a your servant drive away your enemy like obedient hound no said hermione in a horrorstruck squeak please i did not mean that i just hoped you would be able to to help u but she seemed to be going from bad to worse we do not help human snarled the centaur holding harry tightening his grip and rearing a little at the same time so that harrys foot left the ground momentarily we are a race apart and proud to be so we will not permit you to walk from here boasting that we did your bidding were not going to say anything like that harry shouted we know you did not do anything because we wanted you to but nobody seemed to be listening to him a bearded centaur toward the back of the crowd shouted they came here unasked they must pay the consequence a roar of approval met these word and a duncolored centaur shouted they can join the woman you said you did not hurt the innocent shouted hermione real tear sliding down her face now we have not done anything to hurt you we have not used page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wand or threat we just want to go back to school please let u go back we are not all like the traitor firenze human girl shouted the gray centaur to more neighing roar of approval from his fellow perhaps you thought u pretty talking horse we are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasion and insult we do not recognize your law we do not acknowledge your superiority we are but they did not hear what else centaur were for at that moment there came a crashing noise on the edge of the clearing so loud that all of them harry hermione and the fifty or so centaur filling the clearing looked around harrys centaur let him fall to the ground again a his hand flew to his bow and quiver of arrow hermione had been dropped too and harry hurried toward her a two thick tree trunk parted ominously and the monstrous form of grawp the giant appeared in the gap the centaur nearest him backed into those behind the clearing wa now a forest of bow and arrow waiting to be fired all pointing upward at the enormous grayish face now looming over them from just beneath the thick canopy of branch grawp s lopsided mouth wa gaping stupidly they could see his bricklike yellow teeth glimmering in the halflight his dull sludgecolored eye narrowed a he squinted down at the creature at his foot broken rope trailed from both ankle he opened his mouth even wider hagger harry did not know what hagger meant or what language it wa from nor did he much care he wa page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling watching grawp s foot which were almost a long a harrys whole body hermione gripped his arm tightly the centaur were quite silent staring up at the giant whose huge round head moved from side to side a he continued to peer amongst them a though looking for something he had dropped haggeii he said again more insistently get away from here giant called magorian you are not welcome among u these word seemed to make no impression whatsoever on grawp he stooped a little the centaur arm tensed on their bow and then bellowed hagger a few of the centaur looked worried now hermione however gave a gasp harry she whispered i think he trying to say hagrid at this precise moment grawp caught sight of them the only two human in a sea of centaur he lowered his head another foot or so staring intently at them harry could feel hermione shaking a grawp opened his mouth wide again and said in a deep rumbling voice hermy goodness said hermione gripping harrys arm so tightly it wa growing numb and looking a though she wa about to faint he he remembered hermy roared grawp where hagger i do not know squealed hermione terrified i am sorry grawp i do not know page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling grawp want hagger one of the giant massive hand swooped down upon them hermione let out a real scream ran a few step backward and fell over wandless harry braced himself to punch kick bite or whatever else it took a the hand flew toward him and knocked a snow white centaur off his leg it wa what the centaur had been waiting for grawps outstretched finger were a foot from harry when fifty arrow went soaring through the air at the giant peppering his enormous face causing him to howl with pain and rage and straighten up again rubbing his face with his enormous hand breaking off the arrow shaft but forcing the head in still deeper he yelled and stamped his enormous foot and the centaur scattered out of the way pebblesized droplet of grawps blood showered harry a he pulled hermione to her foot and the pair of them ran a fast a they could for the shelter of the tree once there they looked back grawp wa snatching blindly at the centaur a blood ran all down his face they were retreating in disorder galloping away through the tree on the other side of the clearing a harry and hermione watched grawp gave another roar of fury and plunged after them smashing more tree aside a he went oh no said hermione quaking so badly that her knee gave way oh that wa horrible and he might kill them all i am not that fussed to be honest said harry bitterly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the sound of the galloping centaur and the blundering giant were growing fainter and fainter a harry listened to them his scar gave another great throb and a wave of terror swept over him they had wasted so much time they were even further from rescuing sirius than they had been when he had had the vision not only had harry managed to lose his wand but they were stuck in the middle of the forbidden forest with no mean of transport whatsoever smart plan he spat at hermione keen to release some of his fury really smart plan where do we go from here we need to get back up to the castle said hermione faintly by the time we have done that sirius probably be dead said harry kicking a nearby tree in temper there wa a highpitched chattering overhead and he looked up to see an angry bowtruckle flexing it long twiglike finger at him well we can not do anything without wand said hermione hopelessly dragging herself up again anyway harry how exactly were you planning to get all the way to london yeah we were just wondering that said a familiar voice from behind her harry and hermione moved instinctively together peering through the tree a ron came into sight with ginny neville and luna hurrying along behind him all of them looked a little the worse for wear there were several long scratch running the length of ginnys cheek a large purple lump wa swelling page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling above nevilles right eye ron lip wa bleeding worse than ever but all were looking rather pleased with themselves so said ron pushing aside a lowhanging branch and holding out harrys wand had any idea how did you get away asked harry in amazement taking his wand from ron couple of stunner a disarming charm neville brought off a really nice little impediment jinx said ron airily now handing back hermiones wand too but ginny wa best she got malfoy batbogey hex it wa superb his whole face wa covered in the great flapping thing anyway we saw you heading into the forest out of the window and followed what have you done with umbridge she got carried away said harry by a herd of centaur and they left you behind asked ginny looking astonished no they got chased off by grawp said harry who is grawp luna asked interestedly hagrids little brother said ron promptly anyway never mind that now harry what did you find out in the fire ha youknowwho got sirius or yes said harry a his scar gave another painful prickle and i am sure sirius is still alive but i can not see how were going to get there to help him they all fell silent looking rather scared the problem facing them seemed insurmountable page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling well well have to fly will not we said luna in the closest thing to a matteroffact voice harry had ever heard her use okay said harry irritably rounding on her first of all we are not doing anything if you are including yourself in that and second of all ron the only one with a broomstick that is not being guarded by a security troll so i have got a broom said ginny yeah but you are not coming said ron angrily excuse me but i care what happens to sirius a much a you do said ginny her jaw set so that her resemblance to fred and george wa suddenly striking you are too harry began i am three year older than you were when you fought youknowwho over the sorcerer stone she said fiercely and it because of me malfoys stuck back in umbridges office with giant flying bogey attacking him yeah but we were all in the da together said neville quietly it wa all supposed to be about fighting youknow who wa not it and this is the first chance we have had to do something real or wa that all just a game or something no of course it wa not said harry impatiently then we should come too said neville simply we want to help page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling that is right said luna smiling happily harrys eye met ron he knew that ron wa thinking exactly what he wa if he could have chosen any member of the da in addition to himself ron and hermione to join him in the attempt to rescue sirius he would not have picked ginny neville or luna well it doe not matter anyway said harry frustratedly because we still do not know how to get there i thought wed settled that said luna maddeningly were flying look said ron barely containing his anger you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of u can not sprout wing whenever we there are other way of flying than with broomstick said luna serenely i spose were going to ride on the back of the kacky snorgle or whatever it is ron demanded the crumplehorned snorkack can not fly said luna in a dignified voice but they can and hagrid say they are very good at finding place their rider are looking for harry whirled around standing between two tree their white eye gleaming eerily were two thestrals watching the whispered conversation a though they understood every word yes he whispered moving toward them they tossed their reptilian head throwing back long black mane and harry stretched out his hand eagerly and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling patted the nearest one shining neck how could he ever have thought them ugly is it those mad horse thing said ron uncertainly staring at a point slightly to the left of the thestral harry wa patting those one you can not see unless you have watched someone snuff it yeah said harry how many just two well we need three said hermione who wa still looking a little shaken but determined just the same four hermione said ginny scowling i think there are six of u actually said luna calmly counting do not be stupid we can not all go said harry angrily look you three he pointed at neville ginny and luna you are not involved in this you are not they burst into more protest his scar gave another more painful twinge every moment they delayed wa precious he did not have time to argue okay fine it your choice he said curtly but unless we can find more thestrals you are not going to be able oh more of them will come said ginny confidently who like ron wa squinting in quite the wrong direction apparently under the impression that she wa looking at the horse page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what make you think that because in case you had not noticed you and hermione are both covered in blood she said coolly and we know hagrid lure thestrals with raw meat so that is probably why these two turned up in the first place harry felt a soft tug on his robe at that moment and looked down to see the closest thestral licking his sleeve which wa damp with grawps blood okay then he said a bright idea occurring ron and i will take these two and go ahead and hermione can stay here with you three and she will attract more thestrals i am not staying behind said hermione furiously there is no need said luna smiling look here come more now you two must really smell harry turned no fewer than six or seven thestrals were picking their way through the tree now their great leathery wing folded tight to their body their eye gleaming through the darkness he had no excuse now all right he said angrily pick one and get on then page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the department of mystery harry wound his hand tightly into the mane of the nearest thestral placed a foot on a stump nearby and scrambled clumsily onto the horse silken back it did not object but twisted it head around fang bared and attempted to continue it eager licking of his robe he found there wa a way of lodging his knee behind the wing joint that made him feel more secure and looked around at the others neville had heaved himself over the back of the next thestral and wa now attempting to swing one short leg over the creature back luna wa already in place sitting sidesaddle and adjusting her robe a though she did this every day ron hermione and ginny however were still standing motionless on the spot openmouthed and staring what he said how are we supposed to get on said ron faintly when we can not see the thing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling oh it easy said luna sliding obligingly from her thestral and marching over to him hermione and ginny come here she pulled them over to the other thestrals standing around and one by one managed to help them onto the back of their mount all three looked extremely nervous a she wound their hand into the horse mane and told them to grip tightly before getting back onto her own steed this is mad ron said faintly moving his free hand gingerly up and down his horse neck mad if i could just see it you would better hope it stay invisible said harry darkly we all ready then they all nodded and he saw five pair of knee tighten beneath their robe okay he looked down at the back of his thestrals glossy black head and swallowed ministry of magic visitor entrance london then he said uncertainly er if you know where to go for a moment his thestral did nothing at all then with a sweeping movement that nearly unseated him the wing on either side extended the horse crouched slowly and then rocketed upward so fast and so steeply that harry had to clench his arm and leg tightly around the horse to avoid sliding backward over it bony rump he closed his eye and put his face down into the horse silky mane a they burst through the topmost branch of the tree and soared out into a bloodred sunset page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry did not think he had ever moved so fast the thestral streaked over the castle it wide wing hardly beating the cooling air wa slapping harrys face eye screwed up against the rushing wind he looked around and saw his five fellow soaring along behind him each of them bent a low a possible into the neck of their thestral to protect themselves from it slipstream they were over the hogwarts ground they had passed hogsmeade harry could see mountain and gully below them in the falling darkness harry saw small collection of light a they passed over more village then a winding road on which a single car wa beetling it way home through the hill this is bizarre harry heard ron yell from somewhere behind him and he imagined how it must feel to be speeding along at this height with no visible mean of support twilight fell the sky turned to a light dusky purple littered with tiny silver star and soon it wa only the light of muggle town that gave them any clue of how far from the ground they were or how very fast they were traveling harrys arm were wrapped tightly around his horse neck a he willed it to go even faster how much time had elapsed since he had seen sirius lying on the department of mystery floor how much longer would he be able to resist voldemort all harry knew for sure wa that sirius had neither done a voldemort wanted nor died for he wa convinced that either outcome would cause him to feel voldemorts jubilation or fury course through his own body making his scar sear a painfully a it had on the night mr weasley wa attacked page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling on they flew through the gathering darkness harrys face felt stiff and cold his leg numb from gripping the thestrals side so tightly but he did not dare shift position lest he slip he wa deaf from the thundering in his ear and his mouth wa dry and frozen from the rush of cold night air he had lost all sense of how far they had come all his faith wa in the beast below him still streaking purposefully through the night barely flapping it wing a it sped ever onward if they were too late he still alive he still fighting i can feel it if voldemort decided sirius wa not going to crack id know harrys stomach gave a jolt the thestrals head wa suddenly pointing toward the ground and he had actually slid forward a few inch along it neck they were descending at last he heard one of the girl shriek behind him and twisted around dangerously but could see no sign of a falling body presumably they had received a shock from the change of position just a he had and now bright orange light were growing larger and rounder on all side they could see the top of building stream of headlight like luminous insect eye square of pale yellow that were window quite suddenly it seemed they were hurtling toward the pavement harry gripped the thestral with every last ounce of his strength braced for a sudden impact but the horse touched the dark ground a lightly a a shadow and harry slid from his back looking around at the street where the overflowing dumpster still stood a short way from the vandalized telephone box page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling both drained of color in the flat orange glare of the streetlight ron landed a short way away and toppled immediately off his thestral onto the pavement never again he said struggling to his foot he made a though to stride away from his thestral but unable to see it collided with it hindquarter and almost fell over again never ever again that wa the worst hermione and ginny touched down on either side of him both slid off their mount a little more gracefully than ron though with similar expression of relief at being back on firm ground neville jumped down shaking but luna dismounted smoothly where do we go from here then she asked harry in a politely interested voice a though this wa all a rather interesting day trip over here he said he gave his thestral a quick grateful pat then led the way quickly to the battered telephone box and opened the door come on he urged the others a they hesitated ron and ginny marched in obediently hermione neville and luna squashed themselves in after them harry took one glance back at the thestrals now foraging for scrap of rotten food inside the dumpster then forced himself into the box after luna whoevers nearest the receiver dial six two four four two he said ron did it his arm bent bizarrely to reach the dial a it whirred back into place the cool female voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sounded inside the box welcome to the ministry of magic please state your name and business harry potter ron weasley hermione granger harry said very quickly ginny weasley neville longbottom luna lovegood were here to save someone unless your ministry can do it first thank you said the cool female voice visitor please take the badge and attach them to the front of your robe half a dozen badge slid out of the metal chute where returned coin usually appeared hermione scooped them up and handed them mutely to harry over ginny s head he glanced at the topmost one harry potter rescue mission visitor to the ministry you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk which is located at the far end of the atrium fine harry said loudly a his scar gave another throb now can we move the floor of the telephone box shuddered and the pavement rose up past the glass window of the telephone box the scavenging thestrals were sliding out of sight blackness closed over their head and with a dull grinding noise they sank down into the depth of the ministry of magic a chink of soft golden light hit their foot and widening rose up their body harry bent his knee page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and held his wand a ready a he could in such cramped condition peering through the glass to see whether anybody wa waiting for them in the atrium but it seemed to be completely empty the light wa dimmer than it had been by day there were no fire burning under the mantelpiece set into the wall but he saw a the lift slid smoothly to a halt that golden symbol continued to twist sinuously in the dark blue ceiling the ministry of magic wish you a pleasant evening said the woman voice the door of the telephone box burst open harry toppled out of it followed by neville and luna the only sound in the atrium wa the steady rush of water from the golden fountain where jet from the wand of the witch and wizard the point of the centaur arrow the tip of the goblin hat and the houseelfs ear continued to gush into the surrounding pool come on said harry quietly and the six of them sprinted off down the hall harry in the lead past the fountain toward the desk where the security man who had weighed harrys wand had sat and which wa now deserted harry felt sure that there ought to be a security person there sure that their absence wa an ominous sign and his feeling of foreboding increased a they passed through the golden gate to the lift he pressed the nearest down button and a lift clattered into sight almost immediately the golden grille slid apart with a great echoing clanking and they dashed inside harry stabbed the number nine button the grille closed with a bang and the lift began to descend jangling and rattling harry had not realized how noisy the lift were on the day that he had come page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling with mr weasley he wa sure that the din would raise every security person within the building yet when the lift halted the cool female voice said department of mystery and the grille slid open again they stepped out into the corridor where nothing wa moving but the nearest torch flickering in the rush of air from the lift harry turned toward the plain black door after month and month of dreaming about it he wa here at last let u go he whispered and he led the way down the corridor luna right behind him gazing around with her mouth slightly open okay listen said harry stopping again within six foot of the door maybe maybe a couple of people should stay here a a a a lookout and and how are we going to let you know something is coming asked ginny her eyebrow raised you could be mile away were coming with you harry said neville let u get on with it said ron firmly harry still did not want to take them all with him but it seemed he had no choice he turned to face the door and walked forward just a it had in his dream it swung open and he marched forward leading the others over the threshold they were standing in a large circular room everything in here wa black including the floor and ceiling identical unmarked handleless black door were set at interval all around the black wall interspersed with branch of candle whose flame page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling burned blue their cool shimmering light reflected in the shining marble floor so that it looked a though there wa dark water underfoot someone shut the door harry muttered he regretted giving this order the moment neville had obeyed it without the long chink of light from the torchlit corridor behind them the place became so dark that for a moment the only thing they could see were the bunch of shivering blue flame on the wall and their ghostly reflection in the floor below in his dream harry had always walked purposefully across this room to the door immediately opposite the entrance and walked on but there were around a dozen door here just a he wa gazing ahead at the door opposite him trying to decide which wa the right one there wa a great rumbling noise and the candle began to move sideways the circular wall wa rotating hermione grabbed harrys arm a though frightened the floor might move too but it did not for a few second the blue flame around them were blurred to resemble neon line a the wall sped around and then quite a suddenly a it had started the rumbling stopped and everything became stationary once again harrys eye had blue streak burned into them it wa all he could see what wa that about whispered ron fearfully i think it wa to stop u knowing which door we came in from said ginny in a hushed voice page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry realized at once that she wa right he could no sooner have picked the exit from the other door than located an ant upon the jetblack floor meanwhile the door through which they needed to proceed could be any of the dozen surrounding them how are we going to get back out said neville uncomfortably well that doe not matter now said harry forcefully blinking to try and erase the blue line from his vision and clutching his wand tighter than ever we will not need to get out till we have found sirius do not go calling for him though hermione said urgently but harry had never needed her advice le his instinct wa to keep a quiet a possible for the time being where do we go then harry ron asked i do not harry began he swallowed in the dream i went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lift into a dark room that is this one and then i went through another door into a room that kind of glitter we should try a few door he said hastily ill know the right way when i see it cmon he marched straight at the door now facing him the others following close behind him set his left hand against it cool shining surface raised his wand ready to strike the moment it opened and pushed it swung open easily after the darkness of the first room the lamp hanging low on golden chain from this ceiling gave the impression that this long rectangular room wa much brighter though there were no glittering page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling shimmering light such a harry had seen in his dream the place wa quite empty except for a few desk and in the very middle of the room an enormous glass tank of deepgreen water big enough for all of them to swim in which contained a number of pearly white object that were drifting around lazily in the liquid what are those thing whispered ron do not know said harry are they fish breathed ginny aquavirius maggot said luna excitedly dad said the ministry were breeding no said hermione she sounded odd she moved forward to look through the side of the tank they are brain brain yes i wonder what they are doing with them harry joined her at the tank sure enough there could be no mistake now that he saw them at close quarter glimmering eerily they drifted in and out of sight in the depth of the green water looking something like slimy cauliflower let u get out of here said harry this is not right we need to try another door there are door here too said ron pointing around the wall harrys heart sank how big wa this place page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling in my dream i went through that dark room into the second one he said i think we should go back and try from there so they hurried back into the dark circular room the ghostly shape of the brain were now swimming before harrys eye instead of the blue candle flame wait said hermione sharply a luna made to close the door of the brain room behind them flagratev she drew with her wand in midair and a fiery x appeared on the door no sooner had the door clicked shut behind them than there wa a great rumbling and once again the wall began to revolve very fast but now there wa a great redgold blur in amongst the faint blue and when all became still again the fiery cross still burned showing the door they had already tried good thinking said harry okay let u try this one again he strode directly at the door facing him and pushed it open his wand still raised the others at his heel this room wa larger than the last dimly lit and rectangular and the center of it wa sunken forming a great stone pit some twenty foot below them they were standing on the topmost tier of what seemed to be stone bench running all around the room and descending in steep step like an amphitheater or the courtroom in which harry had been tried by the wizengamot instead of a chained chair however there wa a raised stone dais in the center of the lowered floor and upon this dais stood a stone archway that looked so ancient cracked and crumbling that harry wa amazed the thing wa still page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling standing unsupported by any surrounding wall the archway wa hung with a tattered black curtain or veil which despite the complete stillness of the cold surrounding air wa fluttering very slightly a though it had just been touched who is there said harry jumping down onto the bench below there wa no answering voice but the veil continued to flutter and sway careful whispered hermione harry scrambled down the bench one by one until he reached the stone bottom of the sunken pit his footstep echoed loudly a he walked slowly toward the dais the pointed archway looked much taller from where he stood now than when he had been looking down on it from above still the veil swayed gently a though somebody had just passed through it sirius harry spoke again but much more quietly now that he wa nearer he had the strangest feeling that there wa someone standing right behind the veil on the other side of the archway gripping his wand very tightly he edged around the dais but there wa nobody there all that could be seen wa the other side of the tattered black veil let u go called hermione from halfway up the stone step this is not right harry come on let u go she sounded scared much more scared than she had in the room where the brain swam yet harry thought the archway had a kind of beauty about it old though it wa the gently rippling veil intrigued page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling him he felt a very strong inclination to climb up on the dais and walk through it harry let u go okay said hermione more forcefully okay he said but he did not move he had just heard something there were faint whispering murmuring noise coming from the other side of the veil what are you saying he said very loudly so that the word echoed all around the surrounding stone bench nobody talking harry said hermione now moving over to him someone is whispering behind there he said moving out of her reach and continuing to frown at the veil is that you ron i am here mate said ron appearing around the side of the archway can not anyone else hear it harry demanded for the whispering and murmuring wa becoming louder without really meaning to put it there he found his foot wa on the dais i can hear them too breathed luna joining them around the side of the archway and gazing at the swaying veil there are people in there what do you mean in there demanded hermione jumping down from the bottom step and sounding much angrier than the occasion warranted there is not any in there it just an archway there is no room for anybody to be there harry stop it come away page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she grabbed his arm and pulled but he resisted harry we are supposed to be here for sirius she said in a highpitched strained voice sirius harry repeated still gazing mesmerized at the continuously swaying veil yeah and then something slid back into place in his brain sirius captured bound and tortured and he wa staring at this archway he took several pace back from the dais and wrenched his eye from the veil let u go he said that is what i have been trying to well come on then said hermione and she led the way back around the dais on the other side ginny and neville were staring apparently entranced at the veil too without speaking hermione took hold of ginnys arm ron nevilles and they marched them firmly back to the lowest stone bench and clambered all the way back up to the door what dyou reckon that arch wa harry asked hermione a they regained the dark circular room i do not know but whatever it wa it wa dangerous she said firmly again inscribing a fiery cross upon the door once more the wall spun and became still again harry approached a door at random and pushed it did not move what is wrong said hermione page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it locked said harry throwing his weight at the door but it did not budge this is it then is not it said ron excitedly joining harry in the attempt to force the door open bound to be get out of the way said hermione sharply she pointed her wand at the place where a lock would have been on an ordinary door and said alohomora nothing happened sirius knife said harry and he pulled it out from inside his robe and slid it into the crack between the door and the wall the others all watched eagerly a he ran it from top to bottom withdrew it and then flung his shoulder again at the door it remained a firmly shut a ever what wa more when harry looked down at the knife he saw that the blade had melted right were leaving that room said hermione decisively but what if that is the one said ron staring at it with a mixture of apprehension and longing it can not be harry could get through all the door in his dream said hermione marking the door with another fiery cross a harry replaced the nowuseless handle of sirius knife in his pocket you know what could be in there said luna eagerly a the wall started to spin yet again something blibbering no doubt said hermione under her breath and neville gave a nervous little laugh page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the wall slid back to a halt and harry with a feeling of increasing desperation pushed the next door open this is it he knew it at once by the beautiful dancing diamondsparkling light a harrys eye became more accustomed to the brilliant glare he saw clock gleaming from every surface large and small grandfather and carriage hanging in space between the bookcase or standing on desk ranging the length of the room so that a busy relentless ticking filled the place like thousand of minuscule marching footstep the source of the dancing diamondbright light wa a towering crystal bell jar that stood at the far end of the room this way harrys heart wa pumping frantically now that he knew they were on the right track he led the way forward down the narrow space between the line of the desk heading a he had done in his dream for the source of the light the crystal bell jar quite a tall a he wa that stood on a desk and appeared to be full of a billowing glittering wind oh look said ginny a they drew nearer pointing at the very heart of the bell jar drifting along in the sparkling current inside wa a tiny jewelbright egg a it rose in the jar it cracked open and a hummingbird emerged which wa carried to the very top of the jar but a it fell on the draft it feather became bedraggled and damp again and by the time it had been borne back to the bottom of the jar it had been enclosed once more in it egg page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling keep going said harry sharply because ginny showed sign of wanting to stop and watch the egg progress back into a bird you dawdled enough by that old arch she said crossly but followed him past the bell jar to the only door behind it this is it harry said again and his heart wa now pumping so hard and fast he felt it must interfere with his speech it through here he glanced around at them all they had their wand out and looked suddenly serious and anxious he looked back at the door and pushed it swung open they were there they had found the place high a a church and full of nothing but towering shelf covered in small dusty glass orb they glimmered dully in the light issuing from more candle bracket set at interval along the shelf like those in the circular room behind them their flame were burning blue the room wa very cold harry edged forward and peered down one of the shadowy aisle between two row of shelf he could not hear anything nor see the slightest sign of movement you said it wa row ninetyseven whispered hermione yeah breathed harry looking up at the end of the closest row beneath the branch of blueglowing candle protruding from it glimmered the silver figure we need to go right i think whispered hermione squinting to the next row yes that is fiftyfour page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling keep your wand out harry said softly they crept forward staring behind them a they went on down the long alley of shelf the farther end of which were in near total darkness tiny yellowing label had been stuck beneath each glass orb on the shelf some of them had a weird liquid glow others were a dull and dark within a blown lightbulb they passed row eightyfour eightyfive harry wa listening hard for the slightest sound of movement but sirius might be gagged now or else unconscious or said an unbidden voice inside his head he might already be dead id have felt it he told himself his heart now hammering against his adam apple id already know ninetyseven whispered hermione they stood grouped around the end of the row gazing down the alley beside it there wa nobody there he right down at the end said harry whose mouth had become slightly dry you can not see properly from here and he led them forward between the towering row of glass ball some of which glowed softly a they passed he should be near here whispered harry convinced that every step wa going to bring the ragged form of sirius into view upon the darkened floor anywhere here really close harry said hermione tentatively but he did not want to respond his mouth wa very dry now page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling somewhere about here he said they had reached the end of the row and emerged into more dim candlelight there wa nobody there at all all wa echoing dusty silence he might be harry whispered hoarsely peering down the alley next door or maybe he hurried to look down the one beyond that harry said hermione again what he snarled i i do not think sirius is here nobody spoke harry did not want to look at any of them he felt sick he did not understand why sirius wa not here he had to be here this wa where he harry had seen him he ran up the space at the end of the row staring down them empty aisle after empty aisle flickered past he ran the other way back past his staring companion there wa no sign of sirius anywhere nor any hint of a struggle harry ron called what he did not want to hear what ron had to say did not want to hear ron tell him he had been stupid or suggest that they ought to go back to hogwarts but the heat wa rising in his face and he felt a though he would like to skulk down here in the darkness for a long while before facing the brightness of the atrium above and the others accusing stare page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling have you seen this said ron what said harry but eagerly this time it had to be a sign that sirius had been there a clue he strode back to where they were all standing a little way down row ninetyseven but found nothing except ron staring at one of the dusty glass sphere on the shelf what harry repeated glumly it it got your name on said ron harry moved a little closer ron wa pointing at one of the small glass sphere that glowed with a dull inner light though it wa very dusty and appeared not to have been touched for many year my name said harry blankly he stepped forward not a tall a ron he had to crane his neck to read the yellowish label affixed to the shelf right beneath the dusty glass ball in spidery writing wa written a date of some sixteen year previously and below that spt to apwbd dark lord and harry potter harry stared at it what is it ron asked sounding unnerved what is your name doing down here he glanced along at the other label on that stretch of shelf page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tm not here he said sounding perplexed none of the rest of u are here harry i do not think you should touch it said hermione sharply a he stretched out his hand why not he said it something to do with me is not it do not harry said neville suddenly harry looked around at him nevilles round face wa shining slightly with sweat he looked a though he could not take much more suspense it got my name on said harry and feeling slightly reckless he closed his finger around the dusty ball surface he had expected it to feel cold but it did not on the contrary it felt a though it had been lying in the sun for hour a though the glow of light within wa warming it expecting even hoping that something dramatic wa going to happen something exciting that might make their long and dangerous journey worthwhile after all he lifted the glass ball down from it shelf and stared at it nothing whatsoever happened the others moved in closer around harry gazing at the orb a he brushed it free of the clogging dust and then from right behind them a drawling voice said very good potter now turn around nice and slowly and give that to me page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling beyond the veil black shape were emerging out of thin air all around them blocking their way left and right eye glinted through slit in hood a dozen lit wand tip were pointing directly at their heart ginny gave a gasp of horror to me potter repeated the drawling voice of lucius malfoy a he held out his hand palm up harrys inside plummeted sickeningly they were trapped and outnumbered two to one to me said malfoy yet again where is sirius harry said several of the death eater laughed a harsh female voice from the midst of the shadowy figure to harrys left said triumphantly the dark lord always know page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling always echoed malfoy softly now give me the prophecy potter i want to know where sirius is i want to know where sirius is mimicked the woman to his left she and her fellow death eater had closed in so that they were mere foot away from harry and the others the light from their wand dazzling harrys eye you have got him said harry ignoring the rising panic in his chest the dread he had been fighting since they had first entered the ninetyseventh row he here i know he is the little baby woke up fwightened and fort what it dweamed wa twoo said the woman in a horrible mockbaby voice harry felt ron stir beside him do not do anything he muttered not yet the woman who had mimicked him let out a raucous scream of laughter you hear him you hear him giving instruction to the other child a though he think of fighting u oh you do not know potter a i do bellatrix said malfoy softly he ha a great weakness for heroic the dark lord understands this about him now give me the prophecy potter i know sirius is here said harry though panic wa causing his chest to constrict and he felt a though he could not breathe properly i know you have got him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling more of the death eater laughed though the woman still laughed loudest of all it time you learned the difference between life and dream potter said malfoy now give me the prophecy or we start using wand go on then said harry raising his own wand to chest height a he did so the five wand of ron hermione neville ginny and luna rose on either side of him the knot in harrys stomach tightened if sirius really wa not here he had led his friend to their death for no reason at all but the death eater did not strike hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt said malfoy coolly it wa harrys turn to laugh yeah right he said i give you this prophecy is it and you will just let u skip off home will you the word were hardly out of his mouth when the female death eater shrieked accio proph harry wa just ready for her he shouted protego before she had finished her spell and though the glass sphere slipped to the tip of his finger he managed to cling on to it oh he know how to play little bitty baby potter she said her mad eye staring through the slit in her hood very well then i told you no lucius malfoy roared at the woman if you smash it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harrys mind wa racing the death eater wanted this dusty spunglass sphere he had no interest in it he just wanted to get them all out of this alive make sure that none of his friend paid a terrible price for his stupidity the woman stepped forward away from her fellow and pulled off her hood azkaban had hollowed bellatrix lestranges face making it gaunt and skull like but it wa alive with a feverish fanatical glow you need more persuasion she said her chest rising and falling rapidly very well take the smallest one she ordered the death eater beside her let him watch while we torture the little girl ill do it harry felt the others close in around ginny he stepped sideways so that he wa right in front of her the prophecy held up to his chest you will have to smash this if you want to attack any of u he told bellatrix i do not think your bos will be too pleased if you come back without it will he she did not move she merely stared at him the tip of her tongue moistening her thin mouth so said harry what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway he could not think what to do but to keep talking nevilles arm wa pressed against his and he could feel him shaking he could feel one of the others quickened breath on the back of his head he wa hoping they were all thinking hard about way to get out of this because his mind wa blank page loooharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what kind of prophecy repeated bellatrix the grin fading from her face you jest harry potter nope not jesting said harry his eye flicking from death eater to death eater looking for a weak link a space through which they could escape how come voldemort want it several of the death eater let out low hiss you dare speak his name whispered bellatrix yeah said harry maintaining his tight grip on the glass ball expecting another attempt to bewitch it from him yeah i have got no problem saying vol shut your mouth bellatrix shrieked you dare speak his name with your unworthy lip you dare besmirch it with your halfbloods tongue you dare did you know he a halfblood too said harry recklessly hermione gave a little moan in his ear voldemort yeah his mother wa a witch but his dad wa a muggle or ha he been telling you lot he pureblood stupef ivo a jet of red light had shot from the end of bellatrix lestranges wand but malfoy had deflected it his spell caused hers to hit the shelf a foot to the left of harry and several of the glass orb there shattered two figure pearly white a ghost fluid a smoke unfurled themselves from the fragment of broken glass upon the floor and each began to speak their page loolharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling voice vied with each other so that only fragment of what they were saying could be heard over malfoy and bellatrixs shout at the solstice will come a new said the figure of an old bearded man do not attack we need the prophecy he dared he dare shrieked bellatrix incoherently he stand there filthy halfblood wait until we have got the prophecy bawled malfoy and none will come after said the figure of a young woman the two figure that had burst from the shattered sphere had melted into thin air nothing remained of them or their erstwhile home but fragment of glass upon the floor they had however given harry an idea the problem wa going to be conveying it to the others you have not told me what is so special about this prophecy i am supposed to be handing over he said playing for time he moved his foot slowly sideways feeling around for someone el do not play game with u potter said malfoy i am not playing game said harry half his mind on the conversation half on his wandering foot and then he found someone is toe and pressed down upon them a sharp intake of breath behind him told him they were hermiones page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling what she whispered dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar wa hidden in the bowel of the department of mystery said malfoy sneeringly i what said harry and for a moment he quite forgot his plan what about my scar what whispered hermione more urgently behind him can this be said malfoy sounding maliciously delighted some of the death eater were laughing again and under cover of their laughter harry hissed to hermione moving his lip a little a possible smash shelf dumbledore never told you malfoy repeated well this explains why you did not come earlier potter the dark lord wondered why when i say go you did not come running when he showed you the place where it wa hidden in your dream he thought natural curiosity would make you want to hear the exact wording did he said harry behind him he felt rather than heard hermione passing his message to the others and he sought to keep talking to distract the death eater so he wanted me to come and get it did he why why malfoy sounded incredulously delighted because the only people who are permitted to retrieve a prophecy from the department of mystery potter are those about whom it wa made a the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dark lord discovered when he attempted to use others to steal it for him and why did he want to steal a prophecy about me about both of you potter about both of you have not you ever wondered why the dark lord tried to kill you a a baby harry stared into the slitted eyehole through which malfoys gray eye were gleaming wa this prophecy the reason harrys parent had died the reason he carried his lightningbolt scar wa the answer to all of this clutched in his hand someone made a prophecy about voldemort and me he said quietly gazing at lucius malfoy his finger tightening over the warm glass sphere in his hand it wa hardly larger than a snitch and still gritty with dust and he made me come and get it for him why could not he come and get it himself get it himself shrieked bellatrix on a cackle of mad laughter the dark lord walk into the ministry of magic when they are so sweetly ignoring his return the dark lord reveal himself to the aurors when at the moment they are wasting their time on my dear cousin so he got you doing his dirty work for him ha he said harry like he tried to get sturgis to steal it and bode very good potter very good said malfoy slowly but the dark lord know you are not unintell now yelled harry page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling five different voice behind him bellowed reductol five curse flew in five different direction and the shelf opposite them exploded a they hit the towering structure swayed a a hundred glass sphere burst apart pearlywhite figure unfurled into the air and floated there their voice echoing from who knew what longdead past amid the torrent of crashing glass and splintered wood now raining down upon the floor run harry yelled and a the shelf swayed precariously and more glass sphere began to pour from above he seized a handful of hermiones robe and dragged her forward one arm over his head a chunk of shelf and shard of glass thundered down upon them a death eater lunged forward through the cloud of dust and harry elbowed him hard in the masked face they were all yelling there were cry of pain thunderous crash a the shelf collapsed upon themselves weirdly echoing fragment of the seer unleashed from their sphere harry found the way ahead clear and saw ron ginny and luna sprint past him their arm over their head something heavy struck him on the side of the face but he merely ducked his head and sprinted onward a hand caught him by the shoulder he heard hermione shout stupefy and the hand released him at once they were at the end of row ninetyseven harry turned right and began to sprint in earnest he could hear footstep right behind him and hermiones voice urging neville on the door through which they had come wa ajar straight ahead harry could see the glittering light of the bell jar he pelted through it the prophecy still clutched tight and safe in his hand waited for the others to hurtle over the threshold before slamming the door behind them page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling colloportus gasped hermione and the door sealed itself with an odd squelching noise where where are the others gasped harry he had thought that ron luna and ginny had been ahead of them that they would be waiting in this room but there wa nobody there they must have gone the wrong way whispered hermione terror in her face listen whispered neville footstep and shout echoed from behind the door they had just sealed harry put his ear close to the door to listen and heard lucius malfoy roar leave nott leave him i say the dark lord will not care for notts injury a much a losing that prophecy jugson come back here we need to organize well split into pair and search and do not forget be gentle with potter until we have got the prophecy you can kill the others if necessary bellatrix rodolphus you take the left crabbe rabastan go right jugson dolohov the door straight ahead macnair and avery through here rookwood over there mulciber come with me what do we do hermione asked harry trembling from head to foot well we do not stand here waiting for them to find u for a start said harry let u get away from this door they ran quietly a they could past the shimmering bell jar where the tiny egg wa hatching and unhatching toward the exit into the circular hallway at the far end of the room they were almost there page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling when harry heard something large and heavy collide with the door hermione had charmed shut stand aside said a rough voice alohomora a the door flew open harry hermione and neville dived under desk they could see the bottom of the two death eater robe drawing nearer their foot moving rapidly they might have run straight through to the hall said the rough voice check under the desk said another harry saw the knee of the death eater bend poking his wand out from under the desk he shouted stupefy a jet of red light hit the nearest death eater he fell backward into a grandfather clock and knocked it over the second death eater however had leapt aside to avoid harrys spell and now pointed his own wand at hermione who had crawled out from under the desk to get a better aim avada harry launched himself across the floor and grabbed the death eater around the knee causing him to topple and his aim to go awry neville overturned his desk in his anxiety to help pointing his wand wildly at the struggling pair he cried expelliarmus both harrys and the death eater wand flew out of their hand and soared back toward the entrance to the hall of prophecy both scrambled to their foot and charged after them the death eater in front and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry hot on his heel neville bringing up the rear plainly horror truck at what he had done get out of the way harry yelled neville clearly determined to repair the damage harry flung himself sideways a neville took aim again and shouted stupefy the jet of red light flew right over the death eater shoulder and hit a glassfronted cabinet on the wall full of variously shaped hourglass the cabinet fell to the floor and burst apart glass flying everywhere then sprang back up onto the wall fully mended then fell down again and shattered the death eater had snatched up his wand which lay on the floor beside the glittering bell jar harry ducked down behind another desk a the man turned his mask had slipped so that he could not see he ripped it off with his free hand and shouted stup stupefy screamed hermione who had just caught up with them the jet of red light hit the death eater in the middle of his chest he froze his arm still raised his wand fell to the floor with a clatter and he collapsed backward toward the bell jar harry expected to hear a clunk for the man to hit solid glass and slide off the jar onto the floor but instead his head sank through the surface of the bell jar a though it wa nothing but a soap bubble and he came to rest sprawled on his back on the table with his head lying inside the jar full of glittering wind accio wand cried hermione harrys wand flew from a dark corner into her hand and she threw it to him thanks he said right let u get out of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling look out said neville horrified staring at the death eater head in the bell jar all three of them raised their wand again but none of them struck they were all gazing openmouthed appalled at what wa happening to the man head it wa shrinking very fast growing balder and balder the black hair and stubble retracting into his skull his cheek smooth his skull round and covered with a peachlike fuzz a baby head now sat grotesquely on top of the thick muscled neck of the death eater a he struggled to get up again but even a they watched their mouth open the head began to swell to it previous proportion again thick black hair wa sprouting from the pate and chin it time said hermione in an awestruck voice time the death eater shook his ugly head again trying to clear it but before he could pull himself together again it began to shrink back to babyhood once more there wa a shout from a room nearby then a crash and a scream ron harry yelled turning quickly from the monstrous transformation taking place before them ginny luna harry hermione screamed the death eater had pulled his head out of the bell jar his appearance wa utterly bizarre his tiny baby head bawling loudly while his thick arm page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling flailed dangerously in all direction narrowly missing harry who ducked harry raised his wand but to his amazement hermione seized his arm you can not hurt a baby there wa no time to argue the point harry could hear more footstep growing louder from the hall of prophecy they had just left and knew too late that he ought not to have shouted and given away their position come on he said again and leaving the ugly baby headed death eater staggering behind them they took off for the door that stood ajar at the other end of the room leading back into the black hallway they had run halfway toward it when harry saw through the open door two more death eater running across the black room toward them veering left he burst instead into a small dark cluttered office and slammed the door behind them collo began hermione but before she could complete the spell the door had burst open again and the two death eater had come hurtling inside with a cry of triumph both yelled impediment a harry hermione and neville were all knocked backward off their foot neville wa thrown over the desk and disappeared from view hermione smashed into a bookcase and wa promptly deluged in a cascade of heavy book the back of harrys head slammed into the stone wall behind him tiny light burst in front of his eye and for a moment he wa too dizzy and bewildered to react we have got him yelled the death eater nearest harry in an office off page loloharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling silenciol cried hermione and the man voice wa extinguished he continued to mouth through the hole in his mask but no sound came out he wa thrust aside by his fellow petrificus totalusl shouted harry a the second death eater raised his wand his arm and leg snapped together and he fell forward facedown onto the rug at harrys foot stiff a a board and unable to move at all well done ha but the death eater hermione had just struck dumb made a sudden slashing movement with his wand from which flew a streak of what looked like purple flame it passed right across hermiones chest she gave a tiny oh a though of surprise and then crumpled onto the floor where she lay motionless hermione harry fell to his knee beside her a neville crawled rapidly toward her from under the desk his wand held up in front of him the death eater kicked out hard at nevilles head a he emerged his foot broke nevilles wand in two and connected with his face neville gave a howl of pain and recoiled clutching his mouth and nose harry twisted around his own wand held high and saw that the death eater had ripped off his mask and wa pointing his wand directly at harry who recognized the long pale twisted face from the daily prophet antonin dolohov the wizard who had murdered the prewetts dolohov grinned with his free hand he pointed from the prophecy still clutched in harrys hand to himself then at hermione though he could no longer page louharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling speak his meaning could not have been clearer give me the prophecy or you get the same a her like you will not kill u all

properly do not let her be dead do not let her be dead it my fault if she is dead whaddever you do harry said neville fiercely from under the desk lowering his hand to show a clearly broken nose and blood pouring down his mouth and chin dond gib it to him then there wa a crash outside the door and dolohov looked over his shoulder the babyheaded death eater had appeared in the doorway his head bawling his great fist still flailing uncontrollably at everything around him harry seized his chance petrificus tot alu s the spell hit dolohov before he could block it and he toppled forward across his comrade both of them rigid a board and unable to move an inch hermione harry said at once shaking her a the babyheaded death eater blundered out of sight again hermione wake up whaddid he do to her said neville crawling out from under the desk again to kneel at her other side blood streaming from his rapidly swelling nose i do not know neville groped for hermiones wrist page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dat a pulse harry ib sure id is such a powerful wave of relief swept through harry that for a moment he felt lightheaded she is alive yeah i dink so there wa a pause in which harry listened hard for the sound of more footstep but all he could hear were the whimper and blunderings of the baby death eater in the next room neville were not far from the exit harry whispered were right next to that circular room if we can just get you across it and find the right door before any more death eater come ill bet you can get hermione up the corridor and into the lift then you could find someone raise the alarm and whad are you going do do said neville mopping his bleeding nose with his sleeve and frowning at harry i have got to find the others said harry

arm glared at harry who hesitated then grabbed the other and helped hoist hermiones limp form over nevilles shoulder page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling wait said harry snatching up hermiones wand from the floor and shoving it into nevilles hand you would better take this neville kicked aside the broken fragment of his own wand a they walked slowly toward the door my gran going do kill be said neville thickly blood spattering from his nose a he spoke dat wa by dad old wand harry stuck his head out of the door and looked around cautiously the babyheaded death eater wa screaming and banging into thing toppling grandfather clock and overturning desk bawling and confused while the glass cabinet that harry now suspected had contained timeturners continued to fall shatter and repair itself on the wall behind them he never going to notice u he whispered cmon keep close behind me they crept out of the office and back toward the door into the black hallway which now seemed completely deserted they walked a few step forward neville tottering slightly due to hermiones weight the door of the time room swung shut behind them and the wall began to rotate once more the recent blow on the back of harrys head seemed to have unsteadied him he narrowed his eye swaying slightly until the wall stopped moving again with a sinking heart harry saw that hermiones fiery cross had faded from the door so which way dyou reck but before they could make a decision a to which way to try a door to their right sprang open and three people fell out of it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ron croaked harry dashing toward them ginny are you all harry said ron giggling weakly lurching forward seizing the front of harrys robe and gazing at him with unfocused eye there you are ha ha ha you look funny harry you are all messed up ron face wa very white and something dark wa trickling from the corner of his mouth next moment his knee had given way but he still clutched the front of harrys robe so that harry wa pulled into a kind of bow ginny harry said fearfully what happened but ginny shook her head and slid down the wall into a sitting position panting and holding her ankle i think her ankle broken i heard something crack whispered luna who wa bending over her and who alone seemed to be unhurt four of them chased u into a dark room full of planet it wa a very odd place some of the time we were just floating in the dark harry we saw uranus up close said ron still giggling feebly get it harry we saw uranus ha ha ha a bubble of blood grew at the corner of ron mouth and burst anyway one of them grabbed ginnys foot i used the reductor curse and blew up pluto in his face but luna gestured hopelessly at ginny who wa breathing in a very shallow way her eye still closed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and what about ron said harry fearfully a ron continued to giggle still hanging off the front of harrys robe i do not know what they hit him with said luna sadly but he gone a bit funny i could hardly get him along at all harry said ron pulling harrys ear down to his mouth and still giggling weakly you know who this girl is harry she is loony loony lovegood ha ha ha we have got to get out of here said harry firmly luna can you help ginny yes said luna sticking her wand behind her ear for safekeeping putting an arm around ginnys waist and pulling her up it only my ankle i can do it myself said ginny impatiently but next moment she had collapsed sideways and grabbed luna for support harry pulled ron arm over his shoulder just a so many month ago he had pulled dudleys he looked around they had a oneintwelve chance of getting the exit right the first time he heaved ron toward a door they were within a few foot of it when another door across the hall burst open and three death eater sped into the hall led by bellatrix lestrange there they are she shrieked stunning spell shot across the room harry smashed his way through the door ahead flung ron unceremoniously from him and ducked back to help neville in with hermione they were all over the page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling threshold just in time to slam the door against bellatrix colloportus shouted harry and he heard three body slam into the door on the other side it doe not matter said a man voice there are other way in we have got them they are here harry spun around they were back in the brain room and sure enough there were door all around the wall he could hear footstep in the hall behind them a more death eater came running to join the first luna neville help me the three of them tore around the room sealing the door a they went harry crashed into a table and rolled over the top of it in his haste to reach the next door colloportusl there were footstep running along behind the door every now and then another heavy body would launch itself against one so it creaked and shuddered luna and neville were bewitching the door along the opposite wall then a harry reached the very top of the room he heard luna cry collo aaaaaaaaargh he turned in time to see her flying through the air five death eater were surging into the room through the door she had not reached in time luna hit a desk slid over it surface and onto the floor on the other side where she lay sprawled a still a hermione page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling get potter shrieked bellatrix and she ran at him he dodged her and sprinted back up the room he wa safe a long a they thought they might hit the prophecy hey said ron who had staggered to his foot and wa now tottering drunkenly toward harry giggling hey harry there are brain in here ha ha ha is not that weird harry ron get out of the way get down but ron had already pointed his wand at the tank honest harry they are brain look accio brain the scene seemed momentarily frozen harry ginny and neville and each of the death eater turned in spite of themselves to watch the top of the tank a a brain burst from the green liquid like a leaping fish for a moment it seemed suspended in midair then it soared toward ron spinning a it came and what looked like ribbon of moving image flew from it unraveling like roll of film ha ha ha harry look at it said ron watching it disgorge it gaudy innards harry come and touch it bet it weird ron no harry did not know what would happen if ron touched the tentacle of thought now flying behind the brain but he wa sure it would not be anything good he darted forward but ron had already caught the brain in his outstretched hand page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the moment they made contact with his skin the tentacle began wrapping themselves around ron arm like rope harry look what is happen no no i do not like it no stop stop but the thin ribbon were spinning around ron chest now he tugged and tore at them a the brain wa pulled tight against him like an octopus body diffindol yelled harry trying to sever the feeler wrapping themselves tightly around ron before his eye but they would not break ron fell over still thrashing against his bond harry it will suffocate him screamed ginny immobilized by her broken ankle on the floor then a jet of red light flew from one of the death eater wand and hit her squarely in the face she keeled over sideways and lay there unconscious stubefyl shouted neville wheeling around and waving hermiones wand at the oncoming death eater stubefy stubefyl but nothing happened one of the death eater shot their own stunning spell at neville it missed him by inch harry and neville were now the only two left fighting the five death eater two of whom sent stream of silver light like arrow past them that left crater in the wall behind them harry ran for it a bellatrix lestrange sprinted right at him holding the prophecy high above his head he sprinted back up the room all he could think of doing wa to draw the death eater away from the others it seemed to have worked they streaked after him knocking chair and table flying but not daring to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy and he dashed through the only door still open the one through which the death eater themselves had come inwardly praying that neville would stay with ron find some way of releasing him he ran a few foot into the new room and felt the floor vanish he wa falling down steep stone step after steep stone step bouncing on every tier until at last with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on it dais the whole room wa ringing with the death eater laughter he looked up and saw the five who had been in the brain room descending toward him while a many more emerged through other doorway and began leaping from bench to bench toward him harry got to his foot though his leg were trembling so badly they barely supported him the prophecy wa still miraculously unbroken in his left hand his wand clutched tightly in his right he backed away looking around trying to keep all the death eater within his sight the back of his leg hit something solid he had reached the dais where the archway stood he climbed backward onto it the death eater all halted gazing at him some were panting a hard a he wa one wa bleeding badly dolohov freed of the full bodybind wa leering his wand pointing straight at harrys face potter your race is run drawled lucius malfoy pulling off his mask now hand me the prophecy like a good boy let let the others go and ill give it to you said harry desperately a few of the death eater laughed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you are not in a position to bargain potter said lucius malfoy his pale face flushed with pleasure you see there are ten of u and only one of you or ha not dumbledore ever taught you how to count he dot alone shouted a voice from above them he still god be harrys heart sank neville wa scrambling down the stone bench toward them hermiones wand held fast in his trembling hand neville no go back to ron stubefyl neville shouted again pointing his wand at each death eater in turn stubefyl stube one of the largest death eater seized neville from behind pinioning his arm to his side he struggled and kicked several of the death eater laughed it longbottom is not it sneered lucius malfoy well your grandmother is used to losing family member to our because your death will not come a a great shock longbottom repeated bellatrix and a truly evil smile lit her gaunt face why i have had the pleasure of meeting your parent boy i doe you hab roared neville and he fought so hard against his captor encircling grip that the death eater shouted someone stun him no no no said bellatrix she looked transported alive with excitement a she glanced at harry then back at neville no let u see how long longbottom last before he crack like his parent unless potter want to give u the prophecy page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dond gib id do dem roared neville who seemed beside himself kicking and writhing a bellatrix drew nearer to him and his captor her wand raised dond gib id do dem harry bellatrix raised her wand cruciol neville screamed his leg drawn up to his chest so that the death eater holding him wa momentarily holding him off the ground the death eater dropped him and he fell to the floor twitching and screaming in agony that wa just a taster said bellatrix raising her wand so that nevilles scream stopped and he lay sobbing at her foot she turned and gazed up at harry now potter either give u the prophecy or watch your little friend die the hard way harry did not have to think there wa no choice the prophecy wa hot with the heat from his clutching hand a he held it out malfoy jumped forward to take it then high above them two more door burst open and five more people sprinted into the room sirius lupin moody tonks and kingsley malfoy turned and raised his wand but tonks had already sent a stunning spell right at him harry did not wait to see whether it had made contact but dived off the dais out of the way the death eater were completely distracted by the appearance of the member of the order who were now raining spell down upon them a they jumped from step to step toward the sunken floor through the darting body the flash of light harry could see neville crawling along he dodged another jet of red light and flung himself flat on the ground to reach neville page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling are you okay he yelled a another spell soared inch over their head yes said neville trying to pull himself up and ron i dink he all right he wa still fighding the brain when i left the stone floor between them exploded a a spell hit it leaving a crater right where nevilles hand had been second before both scrambled away from the spot then a thick arm came out of nowhere seized harry around the neck and pulled him upright so that his toe were barely touching the floor give it to me growled a voice in his ear give me the prophecy the man wa pressing so tightly on harrys windpipe that he could not breathe through watering eye he saw sirius dueling with a death eater some ten foot away kingsley wa fighting two at once tonks still halfway up the tiered seat wa firing spell down at bellatrix nobody seemed to realize that harry wa dying he turned his wand backward toward the man side but had no breath to utter an incantation and the man free hand wa groping toward the hand in which harry wa grasping the prophecy aargh neville had come lunging out of nowhere unable to articulate a spell he had jabbed hermiones wand hard into the eyehole of the death eater mask the man relinquished harry at once with a howl of pain and harry whirled around to face him and gasped stupefy page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the death eater keeled over backward and his mask slipped off it wa macnair buckbeaks wouldbe killer one of his eye now swollen and bloodshot thanks harry said to neville pulling him aside a sirius and his death eater lurched past dueling so fiercely that their wand were blur then harrys foot made contact with something round and hard and he slipped for a moment he thought he had dropped the prophecy then saw moody magic eye spinning away across the floor it owner wa lying on his side bleeding from the head and his attacker wa now bearing down upon harry and neville dolohov his long pale face twisted with glee tarantallegrcd he shouted his wand pointing at neville whose leg went immediately into a kind of frenzied tap dance unbalancing him and causing him to fall to the floor again now potter he made the same slashing movement with his wand that he had used on hermione just a harry yelled protego harry felt something streak across his face like a blunt knife but the force of it knocked him sideways and he fell over nevilles jerking leg but the shield charm had stopped the worst of the spell dolohov raised his wand again accio proph sirius hurtled out of nowhere rammed dolohov with his shoulder and sent him flying out of the way the prophecy had again flown to the tip of harrys finger but he had managed to cling to it now sirius and dolohov were dueling their wand flashing like sword spark flying from their wand tip page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dolohov drew back his wand to make the same slashing movement he had used on harry and hermione springing up harry yelled petrificus totalusl once again dolohovs arm and leg snapped together and he keeled over backward landing with a crash on his back nice one shouted sirius forcing harrys head down a a pair of stunning spell flew toward them now i want you to get out of they both ducked again a jet of green light had narrowly missed sirius across the room harry saw tonks fall from halfway up the stone step her limp form toppling from stone seat to stone seat and bellatrix triumphant running back toward the fray harry take the prophecy grab neville and run sirius yelled dashing to meet bellatrix harry did not see what happened next kingsley swayed across his field of vision battling with the pockmarked rookwood now maskless another jet of green light flew over harrys head a he launched himself toward neville can you stand he bellowed in nevilles ear a nevilles leg jerked and twitched uncontrollably put your arm round my neck neville did so harry heaved nevilles leg were still flying in every direction they would not support him and then out of nowhere a man lunged at them both fell backward nevilles leg waving wildly like an overturned beetle harry with his left arm held up in the air to try and save the small glass ball from being smashed page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the prophecy give me the prophecy potter snarled lucius malfoys voice in his ear and harry felt the tip of malfoys wand pressing hard between his rib no get off me neville catch it harry flung the prophecy across the floor neville spun himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest malfoy pointed the wand instead at neville but harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled impedimental malfoy wa blasted off his back a harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw malfoy smash into the dais on which sirius and bellatrix were now dueling malfoy aimed his wand at harry and neville again but before he could draw breath to strike lupin had jumped between them harry round up the others and go harry seized neville by the shoulder of his robe and lifted him bodily onto the first tier of stone step nevilles leg twitched and jerked and would not support his weight harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step a spell hit the stone bench at harrys heel it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below neville sank to the ground his leg still jerking and thrashing and thrust the prophecy into his pocket come on said harry desperately hauling at nevilles robe just try and push with your leg he gave another stupendous heave and nevilles robe tore all along the left seam the small spunglass ball dropped from his pocket and before either of page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling them could catch it one of nevilles floundering foot kicked it it flew some ten foot to their right and smashed on the step beneath them a both of them stared at the place where it had broken appalled at what had happened a pearlywhite figure with hugely magnified eye rose into the air unnoticed by any but them harry could see it mouth moving but in all the crash and scream and yell surrounding them not one word of the prophecy could he hear the figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness harry ib sorry cried neville his face anguished a his leg continued to flounder ib so sorry harry i didnd bean do it doe not matter harry shouted just try and stand let u get out of dubbledorel said neville his sweaty face suddenly transported staring over harrys shoulder what dubbledore harry turned to look where neville wa staring directly above them framed in the doorway from the brain room stood albus dumbledore his wand aloft his face white and furious harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body they were saved dumbledore sped down the step past neville and harry who had no more thought of leaving dumbledore wa already at the foot of the step when the death eater nearest realized he wa there there were yell one of the death eater ran for it scrabbling like a monkey up the stone step opposite page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling dumbledores spell pulled him back a easily and effortlessly a though he had hooked him with an invisible line only one couple were still battling apparently unaware of the new arrival harry saw sirius duck bellatrixs jet of red light he wa laughing at her come on you can do better than that he yelled his voice echoing around the cavernous room the second jet of light hit him squarely on the chest the laughter had not quite died from his face but his eye widened in shock harry released neville though he wa unaware of doing so he wa jumping down the step again pulling out his wand a dumbledore turned to the dais too it seemed to take sirius an age to fall his body curved in a graceful arc a he sank backward through the ragged veil hanging from the arch and harry saw the look of mingled fear and surprise on his godfather wasted oncehandsome face a he fell through the ancient doorway and disappeared behind the veil which fluttered for a moment a though in a high wind and then fell back into place harry heard bellatrix lestranges triumphant scream but knew it meant nothing sirius had only just fallen through the archway he would reappear from the other side any second but sirius did not reappear sirius harry yelled sirius page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he had reached the floor his breath coming in searing gasp sirius must be just behind the curtain he harry would pull him back out again but a he reached the ground and sprinted toward the dais lupin grabbed harry around the chest holding him back there is nothing you can do harry get him save him he only just gone through it too late harry we can still reach him harry struggled hard and viciously but lupin would not let go there is nothing you can do harry nothing he gone page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the only one he ever feared he ha not gone harry yelled he did not believe it he would not believe it still he fought lupin with every bit of strength he had lupin did not understand people hid behind that curtain he had heard them whispering the first time he had entered the room sirius wa hiding simply lurking out of sight sirius he bellowed sirius he can not come back harry said lupin his voice breaking a he struggled to contain harry he can not come back because he d he is not dead roared harry sirius there wa movement going on around them pointless bustling the flash of more spell to harry it wa meaningless noise the deflected curse flying past them did not matter nothing mattered except that lupin stop pretending that sirius who wa standing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling foot from them behind that old curtain wa not going to emerge at any moment shaking back his dark hair and eager to reenter the battle lupin dragged harry away from the dais harry still staring at the archway angry at sirius now for keeping him waiting but some part of him realized even a he fought to break free from lupin that sirius had never kept him waiting before sirius had risked everything always to see harry to help him if sirius wa not reappearing out of that archway when harry wa yelling for him a though his life depended on it the only possible explanation wa that he could not come back that he really wa dumbledore had most of the remaining death eater grouped in the middle of the room seemingly immobilized by invisible rope madeye moody had crawled across the room to where tonks lay and wa attempting to revive her behind the dais there were still flash of light grunt and cry kingsley had run forward to continue sirius duel with bellatrix harry neville had slid down the stone bench one by one to the place where harry stood harry wa no longer struggling against lupin who maintained a precautionary grip on his arm nevertheless harry ib really sorry said neville his leg were still dancing uncontrollably wa dat man wa sirius black a a friend of yours harry nodded page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling here said lupin quietly and pointing his wand at nevilles leg he said finite the spell wa lifted nevilles leg fell back onto the floor and remained still lupin face wa pale let u let u find the others where are they all neville lupin turned away from the archway a he spoke it sounded a though every word wa causing him pain deyre all back dere said neville a brain addacked ron bud i dink he all righd and herbiones unconscious bud we could feel a bulse there wa a loud bang and a yell from behind the dais harry saw kingsley yelling in pain hit the ground bellatrix lestrange turned tail and ran a dumbledore whipped around he aimed a spell at her but she deflected it she wa halfway up the step now harry no cried lupin but harry had already ripped his arm from lupin slackened grip she killed sirius bellowed harry she killed him ill kill her and he wa off scrambling up the stone bench people were shouting behind him but he did not care the hem of bellatrixs robe whipped out of sight ahead and they were back in the room where the brain were swimming she aimed a curse over her shoulder the tank rose into the air and tipped harry wa deluged in the foul smelling potion within the brain slipped and slid over him and began spinning their long colored tentacle but he shouted wingardium levioscd and they flew into the air away from him slipping and sliding he ran on toward the door he leapt over luna page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling who wa groaning on the floor past ginny who said harry what past ron who giggled feebly and hermione who wa still unconscious he wrenched open the door into the circular black hall and saw bellatrix disappearing through a door on the other side of the room beyond her wa the corridor leading back to the lift he ran but she had slammed the door behind her and the wall had begun to rotate again once more he wa surrounded by streak of blue light from the whirling candelabra where is the exit he shouted desperately a the wall rumbled to a halt again where is the way out the room seemed to have been waiting for him to ask the door right behind him flew open and the corridor toward the lift stretched ahead of him torch lit and empty he ran he could hear a lift clattering ahead of him he sprinted up the passageway swung around the corner and slammed his fist onto the button to call a second lift it jangled and banged lower and lower the grille slid open and harry dashed inside now hammering the button marked atrium the door slid shut and he wa rising he forced his way out of the lift before the grille were fully open and looked around bellatrix wa almost at the telephone lift at the other end of the hall but she looked back a he sprinted toward her and aimed another spell at him he dodged behind the fountain of magical brother the spell zoomed past him and hit the wrought gold gate at the other end of the atrium so that they rang like bell there were no more footstep she had stopped running he crouched behind the statue listening page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling come out come out little harryv she called in her mockbaby voice which echoed off the polished wooden floor what did you come after me for then i thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin i am shouted harry and a score of ghostly harrys seemed to chorus i am i am i am all around the room aaaaaah did you love him little baby potter hatred rose in harry such a he had never known before he flung himself out from behind the fountain and bellowed cruciov bellatrix screamed the spell had knocked her off her foot but she did not writhe and shriek with pain a neville had she wa already on her foot again breathless no longer laughing harry dodged behind the golden fountain again her counterspell hit the head of the handsome wizard which wa blown off and landed twenty foot away gouging long scratch into the wooden floor never used an unforgivable curse before have you boy she yelled she had abandoned her baby voice now you need to mean them potter you need to really want to cause pain to enjoy it righteous anger will not hurt me for long ill show you how it is done shall i ill give you a lesson harry had been edging around the fountain on the other side she screamed cruciol and he wa forced to duck down again a the centaur arm holding it bow spun off and landed with a crash on the floor a short distance from the golden wizard head potter you can not win against me she cried he could hear her moving to the right trying to get a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling clear shot of him he backed around the statue away from her crouching behind the centaur leg his head level with the houseelfs i wa and am the dark lord most loyal servant i learned the dark art from him and i know spell of such power that you pathetic little boy can never hope to compete stupefy yelled harry he had edged right around to where the goblin stood beaming up at the now headless wizard and taken aim at her back a she peered around the fountain for him she reacted so fast he barely had time to duck protegol the jet of red light his own stunning spell bounced back at him harry scrambled back behind the fountain and one of the goblin ear went flying across the room potter i am going to give you one chance shouted bellatrix give me the prophecy roll it out toward me now and i may spare your life well you are going to have to kill me because it gone harry roared and a he shouted it pain seared across his forehead his scar wa on fire again and he felt a surge of fury that wa quite unconnected with his own rage and he know said harry with a mad laugh to match bellatrix s own your dear old mate voldemort know it gone he not going to be happy with you is he what what do you mean she cried and for the first time there wa fear in her voice the prophecy smashed when i wa trying to get neville up the step what do you think voldemortll say about that then page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling his scar seared and burned the pain of it wa making his eye stream liar she shrieked but he could hear the terror behind the anger now you have got it potter and you will give it to me accio prophecy accio prophecy harry laughed again because he knew it would incense her the pain building in his head so badly he thought his skull might burst he waved his empty hand from behind the oneeared goblin and withdrew it quickly a she sent another jet of green light flying at him nothing there he shouted nothing to summon it smashed and nobody heard what it said tell your bos that no she screamed it is not true you are lying master i tried i tried do not punish me do not waste your breath yelled harry his eye screwed up against the pain in his scar now more terrible than ever he can not hear you from here can not i potter said a high cold voice harry opened his eye tall thin and blackhooded his terrible snakelike face white and gaunt his scarlet slitpupiled eye staring lord voldemort had appeared in the middle of the hall his wand pointing at harry who stood frozen quite unable to move so you smashed my prophecy said voldemort softly staring at harry with those pitiless red eye page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no bella he is not lying i see the truth looking at me from within his worthless mind month of preparation month of effort and my death eater have let harry potter thwart me again master i am sorry i knew not i wa fighting the animagus black sobbed bellatrix flinging herself down at voldemorts foot a he paced slowly nearer master you should know be quiet bella said voldemort dangerously i shall deal with you in a moment do you think i have entered the ministry of magic to hear your sniveling apology but master he is here he is below voldemort paid no attention i have nothing more to say to you potter he said quietly you have irked me too often for too long avada kedavral harry had not even opened his mouth to resist his mind wa blank his wand pointing uselessly at the floor but the headless golden statue of the wizard in the fountain had sprung alive leaping from it plinth and landed on the floor with a crash between harry and voldemort the spell merely glanced off it chest a the statue flung out it arm protecting harry what said voldemort staring around and then he breathed dumbledore harry looked behind him his heart pounding dumbledore wa standing in front of the golden gate page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling voldemort raised his wand and sent another jet of green light at dumbledore who turned and wa gone in a whirling of his cloak next second he had reappeared behind voldemort and waved his wand toward the remnant of the fountain the other statue sprang to life too the statue of the witch ran at bellatrix who screamed and sent spell streaming uselessly off it chest before it dived at her pinning her to the floor meanwhile the goblin and the house elf scuttled toward the fireplace set along the wall and the onearmed centaur galloped at voldemort who vanished and reappeared beside the pool the headless statue thrust harry backward away from the fight a dumbledore advanced on voldemort and the golden centaur cantered around them both it wa foolish to come here tonight tom said dumbledore calmly the aurors are on their way by which time i shall be gone and you dead spat voldemort he sent another killing curse at dumbledore but missed instead hitting the security guard desk which burst into flame dumbledore flicked his own wand the force of the spell that emanated from it wa such that harry though shielded by his stone guard felt his hair stand on end a it passed and this time voldemort wa forced to conjure a shining silver shield out of thin air to deflect it the spell whatever it wa caused no visible damage to the shield though a deep gonglike note reverberated from it an oddly chilling sound you do not seek to kill me dumbledore called voldemort his scarlet eye narrowed over the top of the shield above such brutality are you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling we both know that there are other way of destroying a man tom dumbledore said calmly continuing to walk toward voldemort a though he had not a fear in the world a though nothing had happened to interrupt his stroll up the hall merely taking your life would not satisfy me i admit there is nothing worse than death dumbledore snarled voldemort you are quite wrong said dumbledore still closing in upon voldemort and speaking a lightly a though they were discussing the matter over drink harry felt scared to see him walking along undefended shieldless he wanted to cry out a warning but his headless guard kept shunting him backward toward the wall blocking his every attempt to get out from behind it indeed your failure to understand that there are thing much worse than death ha always been your greatest weakness another jet of green light flew from behind the silver shield this time it wa the onearmed centaur galloping in front of dumbledore that took the blast and shattered into a hundred piece but before the fragment had even hit the floor dumbledore had drawn back his wand and waved it a though brandishing a whip a long thin flame flew from the tip it wrapped itself around voldemort shield and all for a moment it seemed dumbledore had won but then the fiery rope became a serpent which relinquished it hold upon voldemort at once and turned hissing furiously to face dumbledore voldemort vanished the snake reared from the floor ready to strike there wa a burst of flame in midair above dumbledore just a voldemort reappeared standing page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling on the plinth in the middle of the pool where so recently the five statue had stood look outi harry yelled but even a he shouted one more jet of green light had flown at dumbledore from voldemorts wand and the snake had struck fawkes swooped down in front of dumbledore opened his beak wide and swallowed the jet of green light whole he burst into flame and fell to the floor small wrinkled and flightless at the same moment dumbledore brandished his wand in one long fluid movement the snake which had been an instant from sinking it fang into him flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke the water in the pool rose up and covered voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass for a few second voldemort wa visible only a a dark rippling faceless figure shimmering and indistinct upon the plinth clearly struggling to throw off the suffocating mass then he wa gone and the water fell with a crash back into it pool slopping wildly over the side drenching the polished floor master screamed bellatrix sure it wa over sure voldemort had decided to flee harry made to run out from behind his statue guard but dumbledore bellowed stay where you are harry for the first time dumbledore sounded frightened harry could not see why the hall wa quite empty but for themselves the sobbing bellatrix still trapped page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling under her statue and the tiny baby fawkes croaking feebly on the floor and then harrys scar burst open he knew he wa dead it wa pain beyond imagining pain past endurance he wa gone from the hall he wa locked in the coil of a creature with red eye so tightly bound that harry did not know where his body ended and the creature began they were fused together bound by pain and there wa no escape and when the creature spoke it used harrys mouth so that in his agony he felt his jaw move kill me now dumbledore blinded and dying every part of him screaming for release harry felt the creature use him again if death is nothing dumbledore kill the boy let the pain stop thought harry let him kill u end it dumbledore death is nothing compared to this and ill see sirius again and a harrys heart filled with emotion the creature coil loosened the pain wa gone harry wa lying facedown on the floor his glass gone shivering a though he lay upon ice not wood and there were voice echoing through the hall more voice than there should have been harry opened his eye saw his glass lying at the heel of the headless statue that had been guarding him but which now lay flat on it back cracked and immobile he put page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling them on and raised his head an inch to find dumbledores crooked nose inch from his own are you all right harry yes said harry shaking so violently he could not hold his head up properly yeah i am where is voldemort where who are all these what is the atrium wa full of people the floor wa reflecting emeraldgreen flame that had burst into life in all the fireplace along one wall and a stream of witch and wizard wa emerging from them a dumbledore pulled him back to his foot harry saw the tiny gold statue of the houseelf and the goblin leading a stunnedlooking cornelius fudge forward he wa there shouted a scarletrobed man with a ponytail who wa pointing at a pile of golden rubble on the other side of the hall where bellatrix had lain trapped moment before i saw him mr fudge i swear it wa youknowwho he grabbed a woman and disapparated i know williamson i know i saw him too gibbered fudge who wa wearing pajama under his pinstriped cloak and wa gasping a though he had just run mile merlin beard here here in the ministry of magic great heaven above it doe not seem possible my word how can this be if you proceed downstairs into the department of mystery cornelius said dumbledore apparently satisfied that harry wa all right and walking forward so that the newcomer realized he wa there for the first time a few of them raised their wand others simply looked amazed the statue of the elf and goblin applauded and fudge jumped so much that page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling his slipperclad foot left the floor you will find several escaped death eater contained in the death chamber bound by an antidisapparation jinx and awaiting your decision a to what to do with them dumbledore gasped fudge apparently beside himself with amazement you here i i he looked wildly around at the aurors he had brought with him and it could not have been clearer that he wa in half a mind to cry seize him cornelius i am ready to fight your men and win again said dumbledore in a thunderous voice but a few minute ago you saw proof with your own eye that i have been telling you the truth for a year lord voldemort ha returned you have been chasing the wrong men for twelve month and it is time you listened to sense i do not well blustered fudge looking around a though hoping somebody wa going to tell him what to do when nobody did he said very well dawlish williamson go down to the department of mystery and see dumbledore you you will need to tell me exactly the fountain of magical brother what happened he added in a kind of whimper staring around at the floor where the remains of the statue of the witch wizard and centaur now lay scattered we can discus that after i have sent harry back to hogwarts said dumbledore harry harry potter fudge spun around and stared at harry who wa still standing against the wall beside the fallen statue page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling that had been guarding him during dumbledore and voldemorts duel hehere said fudge why what is all this about i shall explain everything repeated dumbledore when harry is back at school he walked away from the pool to the place where the golden wizard head lay on the floor he pointed his wand at it and muttered portus the head glowed blue and trembled noisily against the wooden floor for a few second then became still once more now see here dumbledore said fudge a dumbledore picked up the head and walked back to harry carrying it you have not got authorization for that portkey you can not do thing like that right in front of the minister of magic you you his voice faltered a dumbledore surveyed him magisterially over his halfmoon spectacle you will give the order to remove dolores umbridge from hogwarts said dumbledore you will tell your aurors to stop searching for my care of magical creature teacher so that he can return to work i will give you dumbledore pulled a watch with twelve hand from his pocket and glanced at it half an hour of my time tonight in which i think we shall be more than able to cover the important point of what ha happened here after that i shall need to return to my school if you need more help from me you are of course more than welcome to contact me at hogwarts letter addressed to the headmaster will find me page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fudge goggled worse than ever his mouth wa open and his round face grew pinker under his rumpled gray hair i you dumbledore turned his back on him take this portkey harry he held out the golden head of the statue and harry placed his hand upon it past caring what he did next or where he went i shall see you in half an hour said dumbledore quietly one two three harry felt the familiar sensation of a hook being jerked behind his navel the polished wooden floor wa gone from beneath his foot the atrium fudge and dumbledore had all disappeared and he wa flying forward in a whirlwind of color and sound page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the lost prophecy harrys foot hit solid ground again his knee buckled a little and the golden wizard head fell with a resounding clunk to the floor he looked around and saw that he had arrived in dumbledores office everything seemed to have repaired itself during the headmaster absence the delicate silver instrument stood again upon the spindlelegged table puffing and whirring serenely the portrait of the headmaster and headmistress were snoozing in their frame head lolling back in armchair or against the edge of their picture harry looked through the window there wa a cool line of pale green along the horizon dawn wa approaching the silence and the stillness broken only by the occasional grunt or snuffle of a sleeping portrait wa unbearable to him if his surroundings could have reflected the feeling inside him the picture would have been screaming in pain he walked around the quiet beautiful office breathing quickly trying not to think but he had to think there wa no escape page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it wa his fault sirius had died it wa all his fault if he harry had not been stupid enough to fall for voldemorts trick if he had not been so convinced that what he had seen in his dream wa real if he had only opened his mind to the possibility that voldemort wa a hermione had said banking on harrys love of playing the hero it wa unbearable he would not think about it he could not stand it there wa a terrible hollow inside him he did not want to feel or examine a dark hole where sirius had been where sirius had vanished he did not want to have to be alone with that great silent space he could not stand it a picture behind him gave a particularly loud grunting snore and a cool voice said ah harry potter phineas nigellus gave a long yawn stretching his arm a he watched harry with shrewd narrow eye and what brings you here in the early hour of the morning said phineas this office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster or ha dumbledore sent you here oh do not tell me he gave another shuddering yawn another message for my worthless greatgreatgrandson harry could not speak phineas nigellus did not know that sirius wa dead but harry could not tell him to say it aloud would be to make it final absolute irretrievable a few more of the portrait had stirred now terror of being interrogated made harry stride across the room and seize the doorknob it would not turn he wa shut in page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i hope this mean said the corpulent rednosed wizard who hung on the wall behind dumbledores desk that dumbledore will soon be back with u harry turned the wizard wa eyeing him with great interest harry nodded he tugged again on the doorknob behind his back but it remained immovable oh good said the wizard it ha been very dull without him very dull indeed he settled himself on the thronelike chair on which he had been painted and smiled benignly upon harry dumbledore think very highly of you a i am sure you know he said comfortably oh yes hold you in great esteem the guilt filling the whole of harrys chest like some monstrous weighty parasite now writhed and squirmed harry could not stand this he could not stand being harry anymore he had never felt more trapped inside his own head and body never wished so intensely that he could be somebody anybody else the empty fireplace burst into emeraldgreen flame making harry leap away from the door staring at the man spinning inside the grate a dumbledores tall form unfolded itself from the fire the wizard and witch on the surrounding wall jerked awake many of them gave cry of welcome thank you said dumbledore softly he did not look at harry at first but walked over to the perch beside the door and withdrew from an inside pocket of his robe the tiny ugly featherless page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling fawkes whom he placed gently on the tray of soft ash beneath the golden post where the fullgrown fawkes usually stood well harry said dumbledore finally turning away from the baby bird you will be pleased to hear that none of your fellow student are going to suffer lasting damage from the night event harry tried to say good but no sound came out it seemed to him that dumbledore wa reminding him of the amount of damage he had caused by his action tonight and although dumbledore wa for once looking at him directly and though his expression wa kindly rather than accusatory harry could not bear to meet his eye madam pomfrey is patching everybody up now said dumbledore nymphadora tonks may need to spend a little time in st mungos but it seems that she will make a full recovery harry contented himself with nodding at the carpet which wa growing lighter a the sky outside grew paler he wa sure that all the portrait around the room were listening eagerly to every word dumbledore spoke wondering where dumbledore and harry had been and why there had been injury i know how you are feeling harry said dumbledore very quietly no you do not said harry and his voice wa suddenly loud and strong whitehot anger leapt inside him dumbledore knew nothing about his feeling you see dumbledore said phineas nigellus slyly never try to understand the student they hate it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling they would much rather be tragically misunderstood wallow in selfpity stew in their own that is enough phineas said dumbledore harry turned his back on dumbledore and stared determinedly out of the opposite window he could see the quidditch stadium in the distance sirius had appeared there once disguised a the shaggy black dog so he could watch harry play he had probably come to see whether harry wa a good a james had been harry had never asked him there is no shame in what you are feeling harry said dumbledore s voice on the contrary the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength harry felt the whitehot anger lick his inside blazing in the terrible emptiness filling him with the desire to hurt dumbledore for his calmness and his empty word my greatest strength is it said harry his voice shaking a he stared out at the quidditch stadium no longer seeing it you have not got a clue you do not know what do not i know asked dumbledore calmly it wa too much harry turned around shaking with rage i do not want to talk about how i feel all right harry suffering like this prof you are still a man this pain is part of being human page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling then i do not want tobe human harry roared and he seized one of the delicate silver instrument from the spindlelegged table beside him and flung it across the room it shattered into a hundred tiny piece against the wall several of the picture let out yell of anger and fright and the portrait of armando dippet said a reallyl i do not care harry yelled at them snatching up a lunascope and throwing it into the fireplace i have had enough i have seen enough i want out i want it to end i do not care anymore he seized the table on which the silver instrument had stood and threw that too it broke apart on the floor and the leg rolled in different direction you do care said dumbledore he had not flinched or made a single move to stop harry demolishing his office his expression wa calm almost detached you care so much you feel a though you will bleed to death with the pain of it i do not harry screamed so loudly that he felt his throat might tear and for a second he wanted to rush at dumbledore and break him too shatter that calm old face shake him hurt him make him feel some tiny part of the horror inside harry oh yes you do said dumbledore still more calmly you have now lost your mother your father and the closest thing to a parent you have ever known of course you care you do not know how i feel harry roared you standing there you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but word were no longer enough smashing thing wa no more help he wanted to run he wanted to keep running and never look back he wanted to be somewhere he could not see the clear blue eye staring at him that hatefully calm old face he ran to the door seized the doorknob again and wrenched at it but the door would not open harry turned back to dumbledore let me out he said he wa shaking from head to foot no said dumbledore simply for a few second they stared at each other let me out harry said again no dumbledore repeated if you do not if you keep me in here if you do not let me by all mean continue destroying my possession said dumbledore serenely i daresay i have too many he walked around his desk and sat down behind it watching harry let me out harry said yet again in a voice that wa cold and almost a calm a dumbledore s not until i have had my say said dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling do you do you think i want to do you think i give a i do not care what you have got to say harry roared i do not want to hear anything you have got to say you will said dumbledore sadly because you are not nearly a angry with me a you ought to be if you are to attack me a i know you are close to doing i would like to have thoroughly earned it what are you talking it is my fault that sirius died said dumbledore clearly or i should say almost entirely my fault i will not be so arrogant a to claim responsibility for the whole sirius wa a brave clever and energetic man and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger nevertheless you should never have believed for an instant that there wa any necessity for you to go to the department of mystery tonight if i had been open with you harry a i should have been you would have known a long time ago that voldemort might try and lure you to the department of mystery and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight and sirius would not have had to come after you that blame lie with me and with me alone harry wa still standing with his hand on the doorknob but he wa unaware of it he wa gazing at dumbledore hardly breathing listening yet barely understanding what he wa hearing please sit down said dumbledore it wa not an order it wa a request page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry hesitated then walked slowly across the room now littered with silver cog and fragment of wood and took the seat facing dumbledore s desk am i to understand said phineas nigellus slowly from harrys left that my greatgreatgrandson the last of the black is dead yes phineas said dumbledore i do not believe it said phineas brusquely harry turned his head in time to see phineas marching out of his portrait and knew that he had gone to visit his other painting in grimmauld place he would walk perhaps from portrait to portrait calling for sirius through the house harry i owe you an explanation said dumbledore an explanation of an old man mistake for i see now that what i have done and not done with regard to you bear all the hallmark of the failing of age youth can not know how age think and feel but old men are guilty if they forget what it wa to be young and i seem to have forgotten lately the sun wa rising properly now there wa a rim of dazzling orange visible over the mountain and the sky above it wa colorless and bright the light fell upon dumbledore upon the silver of his eyebrow and beard upon the line gouged deeply into his face i guessed fifteen year ago said dumbledore when i saw the scar upon your forehead what it might mean i guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and voldemort page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you have told me this before professor said harry bluntly he did not care about being rude he did not care about anything very much anymore yes said dumbledore apologetically yes but you see it is necessary to start with your scar for it became apparent shortly after you rejoined the magical world that i wa correct and that your scar wa giving you warning when voldemort wa close to you or else feeling powerful emotion i know said harry wearily and this ability of yours to detect voldemorts presence even when he is disguised and to know what he is feeling when his emotion are roused ha become more and more pronounced since voldemort returned to his own body and his full power harry did not bother to nod he knew all of this already more recently said dumbledore i became concerned that voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists sure enough there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thought that he sensed your presence i am speaking of course of the night when you witnessed the attack on mr weasley yeah snape told me harry muttered professor snape harry dumbledore corrected him quietly but did you not wonder why it wa not i who explained this to you why i did not teach you occlumency why i had not so much a looked at you for month page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry looked up he could see now that dumbledore looked sad and tired yeah harry mumbled yeah i wondered you see continued dumbledore heavily i believed it could not be long before voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind to manipulate and misdirect your thought and i wa not eager to give him more incentive to do so i wa sure that if he realized that our relationship wa or had ever been closer than that of headmaster and pupil he would seize his chance to use you a a mean to spy on me i feared the us to which he would put you the possibility that he might try and posse you harry i believe i wa right to think that voldemort would have made use of you in such a way on those rare occasion when we had close contact i thought i saw a shadow of him stir behind your eye i wa trying in distancing myself from you to protect you an old man mistake harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him ready to strike on those occasion when he and dumbledore made eye contact voldemorts aim in possessing you a he demonstrated tonight would not have been my destruction it would have been yours he hoped when he possessed you briefly a short while ago that i would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him he sighed deeply harry wa letting the word wash over him he would have been so interested to know all this a few month ago and now it wa meaningless compared to the gaping chasm inside him that wa the loss of sirius none of it mattered page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling sirius told me that you felt voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of arthur weasleys attack i knew at once that my worst fear were correct voldemort from that point had realized he could use you in an attempt to arm you against voldemorts assault on your mind i arranged occlumency lesson with professor snape he paused harry watched the sunlight which wa sliding slowly across the polished surface of dumbledores desk illuminate a silver ink pot and a handsome scarlet quill harry could tell that the portrait all around them were awake and listening raptly to dumbledores explanation he could hear the occasional rustle of robe the slight clearing of a throat phineas nigellus had still not returned professor snape discovered dumbledore resumed that you had been dreaming about the door to the department of mystery for month voldemort of course had been obsessed with the possibility of hearing the prophecy ever since he regained his body and a he dwelled on the door so did you though you did not know what it meant and then you saw rookwood who worked in the department of mystery before his arrest telling voldemort what we had known all along that the prophecy held in the ministry of magic are heavily protected only the people to whom they refer can lift them from the shelf without suffering madness in this case either voldemort himself would have to enter the ministry of magic and risk revealing himself at last or else you would have to take it for him it became a matter of even greater urgency that you should master occlumency but i did not muttered harry he said it aloud to try and ease the dead weight of guilt inside him a page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling confession must surely relieve some of the terrible pressure squeezing his heart i did not practice i did not bother i could have stopped myself having those dream hermione kept telling me to do it if i had he would never have been able to show me where to go and sirius would not sirius would not something wa erupting inside harrys head a need to justify himself to explain i tried to check if he would really taken sirius i went to umbridges office i spoke to kreacher in the fire and he said sirius wa not there he said he would gone kreacher lied said dumbledore calmly you are not his master he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself kreacher intended you to go to the ministry of magic he he sent me on purpose oh yes kreacher i am afraid ha been serving more than one master for month how said harry blankly he ha not been out of grimmauld place for year kreacher seized his opportunity shortly before christmas said dumbledore when sirius apparently shouted at him to get out he took sirius at his word and interpreted this a an order to leave the house he went to the only black family member for whom he had any respect left black cousin narcissa sister of bellatrix and wife of lucius malfoy how do you know all this harry said his heart wa beating very fast he felt sick he remembered worrying about kreachers odd absence over page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling christmas remembered him turning up again in the attic kreacher told me last night said dumbledore you see when you gave professor snape that cryptic warning he realized that you had had a vision of sirius trapped in the bowel of the department of mystery he like you attempted to contact sirius at once i should explain that member of the order of the phoenix have more reliable method of communicating than the fire in dolores umbridges office professor snape found that sirius wa alive and safe in grimmauld place when however you did not return from your trip into the forest with dolores umbridge professor snape grew worried that you still believed sirius to be a captive of lord voldemorts he alerted certain order member at once dumbledore heaved a great sigh and then said alastor moody nymphadora tonks kingsley shacklebolt and remus lupin were at headquarters when he made contact all agreed to go to your aid at once professor snape requested that sirius remain behind a he needed somebody to remain at headquarters to tell me what had happened for i wa due there at any moment in the meantime he professor snape intended to search the forest for you but sirius did not wish to remain behind while the others went to search for you he delegated to kreacher the task of telling me what had happened and so it wa that when i arrived in grimmauld place shortly after they had all left for the ministry it wa the elf who told me laughing fit to burst where sirius had gone page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he wa laughing said harry in a hollow voice oh yes said dumbledore you see kreacher wa not able to betray u totally he is not secretkeeper for the order he could not give the malfoys our whereabouts or tell them any of the order confidential plan that he had been forbidden to reveal he wa bound by the enchantment of his kind which is to say that he could not disobey a direct order from his master sirius but he gave narcissa information of the sort that is very valuable to voldemort yet must have seemed much too trivial for sirius to think of banning him from repeating it like what said harry like the fact that the person sirius cared most about in the world wa you said dumbledore quietly like the fact that you were coming to regard sirius a a mixture of father and brother voldemort knew already of course that sirius wa in the order that you knew where he wa but kreachers information made him realize that the one person whom you would go to any length to rescue wa sirius black harrys lip were cold and numb so when i asked kreacher if sirius wa there last night the malfoys undoubtedly on voldemorts instruction had told him he must find a way of keeping sirius out of the way once you had seen the vision of sirius being tortured then if you decided to check whether sirius wa at home or not kreacher would be able to pretend he wa not kreacher injured buckbeak the hippogriff yesterday and at the moment when you made your appearance in the fire sirius wa upstairs trying to tend to him page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling there seemed to be very little air in harrys lung his breathing wa quick and shallow and kreacher told you all this and laughed he croaked he did not wish to tell me said dumbledore but i am a sufficiently accomplished legilimens myself to know when i am being lied to and i persuaded him to tell me the full story before i left for the department of mystery and whispered harry his hand curled in cold fist on his knee and hermione kept telling u to be nice to him she wa quite right harry said dumbledore i warned sirius when we adopted twelve grimmauld place a our headquarters that kreacher must be treated with kindness and respect i also told him that kreacher could be dangerous to u i do not think that sirius took me very seriously or that he ever saw kreacher a a being with feeling a acute a a human do not you blame do not you talk about sirius like harrys breath wa constricted he could not get the word out properly but the rage that had subsided so briefly had flared in him again he would not let dumbledore criticize sirius kreacher s a lying foul he deserved kreacher is what he ha been made by wizard harry said dumbledore yes he is to be pitied his existence ha been a miserable a your friend dobbys he wa forced to do sirius bidding because sirius wa the last of the family to which he wa enslaved but he felt no true loyalty to him and page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling whatever kreachers fault it must be admitted that sirius did nothing to make kreachers lot easier do not talk about sirius like that harry yelled he wa on his foot again furious ready to fly at dumbledore who had plainly not understood sirius at all how brave he wa how much he had suffered what about snape harry spat you are not talking about him are you when i told him voldemort had sirius he just sneered at me a usual harry you know that professor snape had no choice but to pretend not to take you seriously in front of dolores umbridge said dumbledore steadily but a i have explained he informed the order a soon a possible about what you had said it wa he who deduced where you had gone when you did not return from the forest it wa he too who gave professor umbridge fake veritaserum when she wa attempting to force you to tell of sirius whereabouts harry disregarded this he felt a savage pleasure in blaming snape it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt and he wanted to hear dumbledore agree with him snape snape ggoaded sirius about staying in the house he made out sirius wa a coward sirius wa much too old and clever to have allowed such feeble taunt to hurt him said dumbledore snape stopped giving me occlumency lesson harry snarled he threw me out of his office page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling i am aware of it said dumbledore heavily i have already said that it wa a mistake for me not to teach you myself though i wa sure at the time that nothing could have been more dangerous than to open your mind even further to voldemort while in my presence snape made it worse my scar always hurt worse after lesson with him harry remembered ron thought on the subject and plunged on how do you know he wa not trying to soften me up for voldemort make it easier for him to get inside my i trust severus snape said dumbledore simply but i forgot another old man mistake that some wound run too deep for the healing i thought professor snape could overcome his feeling about your father i wa wrong but that is okay is it yelled harry ignoring the scandalized face and disapproving muttering of the portrait covering the wall it okay for snape to hate my dad but it not okay for sirius to hate kreacher sirius did not hate kreacher said dumbledore he regarded him a a servant unworthy of much interest or notice indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike the fountain we destroyed tonight told a lie we wizard have mistreated and abused our fellow for too long and we are now reaping our reward so sirius deserved what he got did he harry yelled i did not say that nor will you ever hear me say it dumbledore replied quietly sirius wa not a cruel man he wa kind to houseelves in general he had page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no love for kreacher because kreacher wa a living reminder of the home sirius had hated yeah he did hate it said harry his voice cracking turning his back on dumbledore and walking away the sun wa bright inside the room now and the eye of all the portrait followed him a he walked without realizing what he wa doing without seeing the office at all you made him stay shut up in that house and he hated it that is why he wanted to get out last night i wa trying to keep sirius alive said dumbledore quietly people do not like being locked up harry said furiously rounding on him you did it to me all last summer dumbledore closed his eye and buried his face in his longfingered hand harry watched him but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion or sadness or whatever it wa from dumbledore did not soften him on the contrary he felt even angrier that dumbledore wa showing sign of weakness he had no business being weak when harry wanted to rage and storm at him dumbledore lowered his hand and surveyed harry through his halfmoon glass it is time he said for me to tell you what i should have told you five year ago harry please sit down i am going to tell you everything i ask only a little patience you will have your chance to rage at me to do whatever you like when i have finished i will not stop you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry glared at him for a moment then flung himself back into the chair opposite dumbledore and waited dumbledore stared for a moment at the sunlit ground outside the window then looked back at harry and said five year ago you arrived at hogwarts harry safe and whole a i had planned and intended well not quite whole you had suffered i knew you would when i left you on your aunt and uncle doorstep i knew i wa condemning you to ten dark and difficult year he paused harry said nothing you might ask and with good reason why it had to be so why could some wizarding family not have taken you in many would have done so more than gladly would have been honored and delighted to raise you a a son my answer is that my priority wa to keep you alive you were in more danger than perhaps anyone but myself realized voldemort had been vanquished hour before but his supporter and many of them are almost a terrible a he were still at large angry desperate and violent and i had to make my decision too with regard to the year ahead did i believe that voldemort wa gone forever no i knew not whether it would be ten twenty or fifty year before he returned but i wa sure he would do so and i wa sure too knowing him a i have done that he would not rest until he killed you i knew that voldemort s knowledge of magic is perhaps more extensive than any wizard alive i knew that even my most complex and powerful protective spell and charm were unlikely to be invincible if he ever returned to full power page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but i knew too where voldemort wa weak and so i made my decision you would be protected by an ancient magic of which he know which he despises and which he ha always therefore underestimated to his cost i am speaking of course of the fact that your mother died to save you she gave you a lingering protection he never expected a protection that flow in your vein to this day i put my trust therefore in your mother blood i delivered you to her sister her only remaining relative she doe not love me said harry at once she doe not give a damn but she took you dumbledore cut across him she may have taken you grudgingly furiously unwillingly bitterly yet still she took you and in doing so she sealed the charm i placed upon you your mother sacrifice made the bond of blood the strongest shield i could give you i still do not while you can still call home the place where your mother blood dwells there you can not be touched or harmed by voldemort he she would her blood but it life on in you and her sister her blood became your refuge you need return there only once a year but a long a you can still call it home there he can not hurt you your aunt know this i explained what i had done in the letter i left with you on her doorstep she know that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen year wait said harry wait a moment he sat up straighter in his chair staring at dumbledore page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you sent that howler you told her to remember it wa your voice i thought said dumbledore inclining his head slightly that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you i suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the danger of having you a a surrogate son it did said harry quietly well my uncle more than her he wanted to chuck me out but after the howler came she she said i had to stay he stared at the floor for a moment then said but what is this got to do with he could not say sirius name five year ago then continued dumbledore a though he had not paused in his story you arrived at hogwarts neither a happy nor a well nourished a i would have liked perhaps yet alive and healthy you were not a pampered little prince but a normal a boy a i could have hoped under the circumstance thus far my plan wa working well and then well you will remember the event of your first year at hogwarts quite a clearly a i do you rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you and sooner much sooner than i had anticipated you found yourself facetoface with voldemort you survived again you did more you delayed his return to full power and strength you fought a man fight i wa prouder of you than i can say yet there wa a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine said dumbledore an obvious flaw that i knew even then might be the undoing of it all and yet knowing how important it wa that my plan should succeed i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling told myself that i would not permit this flaw to min it i alone could prevent this so i alone must be strong and here wa my first test a you lay in the hospital wing weak from your struggle with voldemort i do not understand what you are saying said harry do not you remember asking me a you lay in the hospital wing why voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby harry nodded ought i to have told you then harry stared into the blue eye and said nothing but his heart wa racing again you do not see the flaw in the plan yet no perhaps not well a you know i decided not to answer you eleven i told myself wa much too young to know i had never intended to tell you when you were eleven the knowledge would be too much at such a young age i should have recognized the danger sign then i should have asked myself why i did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which i knew one day i must give a terrible answer i should have recognized that i wa too happy to think that i did not have to do it on that particular day you were too young much too young and so we entered your second year at hogwarts and once again you met challenge even grown wizard have never faced once again you acquitted yourself beyond my wildest dream you did not ask me again however why voldemort had left that mark upon you we discussed your scar oh yes we came page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling very very close to the subject why did i not tell you everything well it seemed to me that twelve wa after all hardly better than eleven to receive such information i allowed you to leave my presence bloodstained exhausted but exhilarated and if i felt a twinge of unease that i ought perhaps have told you then it wa swiftly silenced you were still so young you see and i could not find it in me to spoil that night of triumph do you see harry do you see the flaw in my brilliant plan now i had fallen into the trap i had foreseen that i had told myself i could avoid that i must avoid i do not i cared about you too much said dumbledore simply i cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth more for your peace of mind than my plan more for your life than the life that might be lost if the plan failed in other word i acted exactly a voldemort expects we fool who love to act is there a defense i defy anyone who ha watched you a i have and i have watched you more closely than you can have imagined not to want to save you more pain than you had already suffered what did i care if number of nameless and faceless people and creature were slaughtered in the vague future if in the here and now you were alive and well and happy i never dreamed that i would have such a person on my hand we entered your third year i watched from afar a you struggled to repel dementors a you found sirius learned what he wa and rescued him wa i page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling to tell you then at the moment when you had triumphantly snatched your godfather from the jaw of the ministry but now at the age of thirteen my excuse were running out young you might be but you had proved you were exceptional my conscience wa uneasy harry i knew the time must come soon but you came out of the maze last year having watched cedric diggory die having escaped death so narrowly yourself and i did not tell you though i knew now voldemort had returned i must do it soon and now tonight i know you have long been ready for the knowledge i have kept from you for so long because you have proved that i should have placed the burden upon you before this my only defense is this i have watched you struggling under more burden than any student who ha ever passed through this school and i could not bring myself to add another the greatest one of all harry waited but dumbledore did not speak i still do not understand voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth he knew the prophecy had been made though he did not know it full content he set out to kill you when you were still a baby believing he wa fulfilling the term of the prophecy he discovered to his cost that he wa mistaken when the curse intended to kill you backfired and so since his return to his body and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year he ha been determined to hear that prophecy in it entirety this is the weapon he ha been seeking so assiduously since his return the knowledge of how to destroy you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the sun had risen fully now dumbledores office wa bathed in it the glass case in which the sword of godric gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque the fragment of the instrument harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrop and behind him the baby fawkes made soft chirruping noise in his nest of ash the prophecy smashed harry said blankly i wa pulling neville up those bench in the the room where the archway wa and i ripped his robe and it fell the thing that smashed wa merely the record of the prophecy kept by the department of mystery but the prophecy wa made to somebody and that person ha the mean of recalling it perfectly who heard it asked harry though he thought he knew the answer already i did said dumbledore on a cold wet night sixteen year ago in a room above the bar at the hog head inn i had gone there to see an applicant for the post of divination teacher though it wa against my inclination to allow the subject of divination to continue at all the applicant however wa the greatgreatgranddaughter of a very famous very gifted seer and i thought it common politeness to meet her i wa disappointed it seemed to me that she had not a trace of the gift herself i told her courteously i hope that i did not think she would be suitable for the post i turned to leave dumbledore got to his foot and walked past harry to the black cabinet that stood beside fawkes perch he bent down slid back a catch and took from inside it the shallow stone basin carved with rune around the edge in which harry had seen his father page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling tormenting snape dumbledore walked back to the desk placed the pensieve upon it and raised his wand to his own temple from it he withdrew silvery gossamerfine strand of thought clinging to the wand and deposited them in the basin he sat back down behind his desk and watched his thought swirl and drift inside the pensieve for a moment then with a sigh he raised his wand and prodded the silvery substance with it tip a figure rose out of it draped in shawl her eye magnified to enormous size behind her glass and she revolved slowly her foot in the basin but when sibyll trelawney spoke it wa not in her usual ethereal mystic voice but in the harsh hoarse tone harry had heard her use once before the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord approach born to those who have thrice defied him born a the seventh month dy and the dark lord will mark him a his equal but he will have power the dark lord know not and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives the one with the power to vanquish the dark lord will be born a the seventh month dy the slowly revolving professor trelawney sank back into the silver mass below and vanished the silence within the office wa absolute neither dumbledore nor harry nor any of the portrait made a sound even fawkes had fallen silent professor dumbledore harry said very quietly for dumbledore still staring at the pensieve seemed completely lost in thought it did that mean what did that mean page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it meant said dumbledore that the person who ha the only chance of conquering lord voldemort for good wa born at the end of july nearly sixteen year ago this boy would be born to parent who had already defied voldemort three time harry felt a though something wa closing in upon him his breathing seemed difficult again it mean me dumbledore surveyed him for a moment through his glass the odd thing is harry he said softly that it may not have meant you at all sibylls prophecy could have applied to two wizard boy both born at the end of july that year both of whom had parent in the order of the phoenix both set of parent having narrowly escaped voldemort three time one of course wa you the other wa neville longbottom but then but then why wa it my name on the prophecy and not nevilles the official record wa relabeled after voldemort s attack on you a a child said dumbledore it seemed plain to the keeper of the hall of prophecy that voldemort could only have tried to kill you because he knew you to be the one to whom sibyll wa referring then it might not be me said harry i am afraid said dumbledore slowly looking a though every word cost him a great effort that there is no doubt that it is you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but you said neville wa born at the end of july too and his mum and dad you are forgetting the next part of the prophecy the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish voldemort voldemort himself would mark him a his equal and so he did harry he chose you not neville he gave you the scar that ha proved both blessing and curse but he might have chosen wrong said harry he might have marked the wrong person he chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him said dumbledore and notice this harry he chose not the pureblood which according to his creed is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing but the halfblood like himself he saw himself in you before he had ever seen you and in marking you with that scar he did not kill you a he intended but gave you power and a future which have fitted you to escape him not once but four time so far something that neither your parent nor nevilles parent ever achieved why did he do it then said harry who felt numb and cold why did he try and kill me a a baby he should have waited to see whether neville or i looked more dangerous when we were older and tried to kill whoever it wa then that might indeed have been the more practical course said dumbledore except that voldemorts information about the prophecy wa incomplete the hog head inn which sibyll chose for it cheapness ha long attracted shall we say a more interesting clientele than the three broomstick a you and your friend found out to your cost and i to mine that night it is a place where it is never safe to page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling assume you are not being overheard of course i had not dreamed when i set out to meet sibyll trelawney that i would hear anything worth overhearing my our one stroke of good fortune wa that the eavesdropper wa detected only a short way into the prophecy and thrown from the building so he only heard he heard only the first part the part foretelling the birth of a boy in july to parent who had thrice defied voldemort consequently he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you again marking you a his equal so voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you that it might be wise to wait or to learn more he did not know that you would have power the dark lord know not but i do not said harry in a strangled voice i have not any power he ha not got i could not fight the way he did tonight i can not posse people or or kill them there is a room in the department of mystery interrupted dumbledore that is kept locked at all time it contains a force that is at once more wonderful and more terrible than death than human intelligence than force of nature it is also perhaps the most mysterious of the many subject for study that reside there it is the power held within that room that you posse in such quantity and which voldemort ha not at all that power took you to save sirius tonight that power also saved you from possession by voldemort because he could not bear to reside in a body so full of the force he detests in the end it mattered not that you could not close your mind it wa your heart that saved you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry closed his eye if he had not gone to save sirius sirius would not have died more to stave off the moment when he would have to think of sirius again harry asked without caring much about the answer the end of the prophecy it wa something about neither can live while the other survives said dumbledore so said harry dredging up the word from what felt like a deep well of despair inside him so doe that mean that that one of u ha got to kill the other one in the end yes said dumbledore for a long time neither of them spoke somewhere far beyond the office wall harry could hear the sound of voice student heading down to the great hall for an early breakfast perhaps it seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food who laughed who neither knew nor cared that sirius black wa gone forever sirius seemed a million mile away already even if a part of harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil he would have found sirius looking back at him greeting him perhaps with his laugh like a bark i feel i owe you another explanation harry said dumbledore hesitantly you may perhaps have wondered why i never chose you a a prefect i must confess that i rather thought you had enough responsibility to be going on with harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down dumbledore s face into his long silver beard page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the second war begin hewhomustnotbenamed return in a brief statement friday night minister of magic cornelius fudge confirmed that hewhomustnotbe named ha returned to this country and is active once more it is with great regret that i must confirm that the wizard styling himself lord well you know who i mean is alive and among u again said fudge looking tired and flustered a he addressed reporter it is with almost equal regret that we report the mass revolt of the dementors of azkaban who have shown themselves averse to continuing in the ministry employ we believe that the dementors are currently taking direction from lord thingy we urge the magical population to remain vigilant the ministry is currently publishing guide to elementary home and personal defense that will be delivered free to all wizarding home within the coming month page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the minister statement wa met with dismay and alarm from the wizarding community which a recently a last wednesday wa receiving ministry assurance that there wa no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumor that youknowwho is operating amongst u once more detail of the event that led to the ministry turnaround are still hazy though it is believed that hewhomustnotbenamed and a select band of follower known a death eater gained entry to the ministry of magic itself on thursday evening albus dumbledore newly reinstated headmaster of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry reinstated member of the international confederation of wizard and reinstated chief warlock of the wizengamot wa unavailable for comment last night he ha insisted for a year that youknowwho wa not dead a wa widely hoped and believed but recruiting follower once more for a fresh attempt to seize power meanwhile the boy who lived there you are harry i knew they would drag you into it somehow said hermione looking over the top of the paper at him they were in the hospital wing harry wa sitting on the end of ron bed and they were both listening to hermione read the front page of the sunday prophet ginny whose ankle had been mended in a trice by madam pomfrey wa curled up at the foot of hermiones bed neville whose nose had likewise been returned to it normal size and shape wa in a chair between the two bed and luna who had dropped in to visit clutching the latest edition of the quibbler wa reading the magazine upside down and apparently not taking in a word hermione wa saying page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he the boy who lived again now though is not he said ron darkly not such a showoff maniac anymore eh he helped himself to a handful of chocolate frog from the immense pile on his bedside cabinet threw a few to harry ginny and neville and ripped off the wrapper of his own with his teeth there were still deep welt on his forearm where the brain tentacle had wrapped around him according to madam pomfrey thought could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else though since she had started applying copious amount of dr ubblys oblivious unction there seemed to be some improvement yes they are very complimentary about you now harry said hermione now scanning down the article a lone voice of truth perceived a unbalanced yet never wavered in his story forced to bear ridicule and slander hmmm said hermione frowning i notice they do not mention the fact that it wa them doing all the ridiculing and slandering though she winced slightly and put a hand to her rib the curse dolohov had used on her though le effective than it would have been had he been able to say the incantation aloud had nevertheless caused in madam pomfreys word quite enough damage to be going on with hermione wa having to take ten different type of potion every day and although she wa improving greatly wa already bored with the hospital wing youknow who is last attempt to take over page two to four what the ministry should have told u page five why nobody listened to albus dumbledore page six to eight exclusive interview with harry potter page nine well said hermione folding up page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling the newspaper and throwing it aside it certainly given them lot to write about and that interview with harry is not exclusive it the one that wa in the quibbler month ago daddy sold it to them said luna vaguely turning a page of the quibbler he got a very good price for it too so were going to go on an expedition to sweden this summer and see if we can catch a crumple horned snorkack hermione seemed to struggle with herself for a moment then said that sound lovely ginny caught harrys eye and looked away quickly grinning so anyway said hermione sitting up a little straighter and wincing again what is going on in school well flitwicks got rid of fred and george swamp said ginny he did it in about three second but he left a tiny patch under the window and he roped it off why said hermione looking startled oh he just say it wa a really good bit of magic said ginny shrugging i think he left it a a monument to fred and george said ron through a mouthful of chocolate they sent me all these you know he told harry pointing at the small mountain of frog beside him must be doing all right out of that joke shop eh hermione looked rather disapproving and asked so ha all the trouble stopped now dumbledores back page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes said neville everythings settled right back down again i spose filch is happy is he asked ron propping a chocolate frog card featuring dumbledore against his water jug not at all said ginny he really really miserable actually she lowered her voice to a whisper he keep saying umbridge wa the best thing that ever happened to hogwarts all six of them looked around professor umbridge wa lying in a bed opposite them gazing up at the ceiling dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaur how he had done it how he had emerged from the tree supporting professor umbridge without so much a a scratch on him nobody knew and umbridge wa certainly not telling since she had returned to the castle she had not a far a any of them knew uttered a single word nobody really knew what wa wrong with her either her usually neat mousy hair wa very untidy and there were bit of twig and leaf in it but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed madam pomfrey say she is just in shock whispered hermione sulking more like said ginny yeah she show sign of life if you do this said ron and with his tongue he made soft clipclopping noise umbridge sat bolt upright looking wildly around anything wrong professor called madam pomfrey poking her head around her office door page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling no no said umbridge sinking back into her pillow no i must have been dreaming hermione and ginny muffled their laughter in the bedclothes speaking of centaur said hermione when she had recovered a little who is divination teacher now is firenze staying he got to said harry the other centaur will not take him back will they it look like he and trelawney are both going to teach said ginny bet dumbledore wish he could have got rid of trelawney for good said ron now munching on his fourteenth frog mind you the whole subject useless if you ask me firenze is not a lot better how can you say that hermione demanded after we have just found out that there are real prophecy harrys heart began to race he had not told ron hermione or anyone else what the prophecy had contained neville had told them it had smashed while harry wa pulling him up the step in the death room and harry had not yet corrected this impression he wa not ready to see their expression when he told them that he must be either murderer or victim there wa no other way it is a pity it broke said hermione quietly shaking her head yeah it is said ron still at least youknowwho never found out what wa in it either where are page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling you going he added looking both surprised and disappointed a harry stood up er hagrids said harry you know he just got back and i promised id go down and see him and tell him how you two are oh all right then said ron grumpily looking out of the dormitory window at the patch of bright blue sky beyond wish we could come say hello to him for u called hermione a harry proceeded down the ward and ask him what is happening about about his little friend harry gave a wave of his hand to show he had heard and understood a he left the dormitory the castle seemed very quiet even for a sunday everybody wa clearly out in the sunny ground enjoying the end of their exam and the prospect of a last few day of term unhampered by studying or homework harry walked slowly along the deserted corridor peering out of window a he went he could see people messing around in the air over the quidditch pitch and a couple of student swimming in the lake accompanied by the giant squid he wa finding it hard at the moment to decide whether he wanted to be with people or not whenever he wa in company he wanted to get away and whenever he wa alone he wanted company he thought he might really go and visit hagrid though he had not talked to him properly since he had returned harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when malfoy crabbe and goyle emerged from a door on the right that harry knew led page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling down to the slytherin common room harry stopped dead so did malfoy and the others for a few moment the only sound were the shout laughter and splash drifting into the hall from the ground through the open front door malfoy glanced around harry knew he wa checking for sign of teacher then he looked back at harry and said in a low voice you are dead potter harry raised his eyebrow funny he said you would think id have stopped walking around malfoy looked angrier than harry had ever seen him he felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of his pale pointed face contorted with rage you are going to pay said malfoy in a voice barely louder than a whisper i am going to make you pay for what you have done to my father well i am terrified now said harry sarcastically i spose lord voldemorts just a warmup act compared to you three what is the matter he said for malfoy crabbe and goyle had all looked stricken at the sound of the name he your dad mate is not he not scared of him are you you think you are such a big man potter said malfoy advancing now crabbe and goyle flanking him you wait ill have you you can not land my father in prison i thought i just had said harry the dementors have left azkaban said malfoy quietly dad and the othersll be out in no time page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yeah i expect they will said harry still at least everyone know what scumbags they are now malfoys hand flew toward his wand but harry wa too quick for him he had drawn his own wand before malfoys finger had even entered the pocket of his robe potter the voice rang across the entrance hall snape had emerged from the staircase leading down to his office and at the sight of him harry felt a great rush of hatred beyond anything he felt toward malfoy whatever dumbledore said he would never forgive snape never what are you doing potter said snape coldly a ever a he strode over to the four of them i am trying to decide what curse to use on malfoy sir said harry fiercely snape stared at him put that wand away at once he said curtly ten point from gryff snape looked toward the giant hourglass on the wall and gave a sneering smile ah i see there are no longer any point left in the gryffindor hourglass to take away in that case potter we will simply have to add some more professor mcgonagall had just stumped up the stone step into the castle she wa carrying a tartan page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling carpetbag in one hand and leaning heavily on a walking stick with her other but otherwise looked quite well professor mcgonagall said snape striding forward out of st mungos i see yes professor snape said professor mcgonagall shrugging off her traveling cloak i am quite a good a new you two crabbe goyle she beckoned them forward imperiously and they came shuffling their large foot and looking awkward here said professor mcgonagall thrusting her carpetbag into crabbe s chest and her cloak into goyles take these up to my office for me they turned and stumped away up the marble staircase right then said professor mcgonagall looking up at the hourglass on the wall well i think potter and his friend ought to have fifty point apiece for alerting the world to the return of you know who what say you professor snape what snapped snape though harry knew he had heard perfectly well oh well i suppose so that is fifty each for potter the two weasleys longbottom and miss granger said professor mcgonagall and a shower of ruby fell down into the bottom bulb of gryffindors hourglass a she spoke oh and fifty for miss lovegood i suppose she added and a number of sapphire fell into ravenclaws glass now you wanted to take ten from mr potter i think professor snape so there we are page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a few ruby retreated into the upper bulb leaving a respectable amount below nevertheless well potter malfoy i think you ought to be outside on a glorious day like this professor mcgonagall continued briskly harry did not need telling twice he thrust his wand back inside his robe and headed straight for the front door without another glance at snape and malfoy the hot sun hit him with a blast a he walked across the lawn toward hagrids cabin student lying around on the grass sunbathing talking reading the sunday prophet and eating sweet looked up at him a he passed some called out to him or else waved clearly eager to show that they like the prophet had decided he wa something of a hero harry said nothing to any of them he had no idea how much they knew of what had happened three day ago but he had so far avoided being questioned and preferred it that way he thought at first when he knocked on hagrids cabin door that he wa out but then fang came charging around the corner and almost bowled him over with the enthusiasm of his welcome hagrid it transpired wa picking runner bean in his back garden all righ harry he said beaming when harry approached the fence come in come in well have a cup o dandelion juice how is thing hagrid asked him a they settled down at his wooden table with a glass apiece of iced juice you er feelin all righ are yeh page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry knew from the look of concern on hagrids face that he wa not referring to harrys physical well being i am fine harry said quickly because he could not bear to discus the thing that he knew wa in hagrids mind so where have you been bin hidin out in the mountain said hagrid up in a cave like sirius did when he hagrid broke off cleared his throat gruffly looked at harry and took a long draft of juice anyway back now he said feebly you you look better said harry who wa determined to keep the conversation moving away from sirius wha said hagrid raising a massive hand and feeling his face oh oh yeah well grawpys load better behaved now load seemed right pleased ter see me when i got back ter tell yeh the truth he a good lad really i have bin thinkin abou tryin ter find him a lady friend actually harry would normally have tried to persuade hagrid out of this idea at once the prospect of a second giant taking up residence in the forest possibly even wilder and more brutal than grawp wa positively alarming but somehow harry could not muster the energy necessary to argue the point he wa starting to wish he wa alone again and with the idea of hastening his departure he took several large gulp of his dandelion juice half emptying his glass page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling evryone know you have bin tellin the truth now harry said hagrid softly and unexpectedly thas got to be better hasn it harry shrugged look hagrid leaned toward him across the table i knew sirius longer n you did he died in battle an thas the way he would have wanted ter go he did not want to go at all said harry angrily hagrid bowed his great shaggy head nah i don reckon he did he said quietly but still harry he wa never one ter sit around at home an let other people do the fightin he couldn have lived with himself if he hadn gone ter help harry leapt up again i have got to go and visit ron and hermione in the hospital wing he said mechanically oh said hagrid looking rather upset oh all righ then harry take care of yerself then an drop back in if yehve got a mo yeah right harry crossed to the door a fast a he could and pulled it open he wa out in the sunshine again before hagrid had finished saying goodbye and walked away across the lawn once again people called out to him a he passed he closed his eye for a few moment wishing they would all vanish that he could open his eye and find himself alone in the ground page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling a few day ago before his exam had finished and he had seen the vision voldemort had planted in his mind he would have given almost anything for the wizarding world to know that he had been telling the truth for them to believe that voldemort wa back and know that he wa neither a liar nor mad now however he walked a short way around the lake sat down on it bank sheltered from the gaze of passersby behind a tangle of shrub and stared out over the gleaming water thinking perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone wa because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with dumbledore an invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world he wa he had always been a marked man it wa just that he had never really understood what that meant and yet sitting here on the edge of the lake with the terrible weight of grief dragging at him with the loss of sirius so raw and fresh inside he could not muster any great sense of fear it wa sunny and the ground around him were full of laughing people and even though he felt a distant from them a though he belonged to a different race it wa still very hard to believe a he sat here that his life must include or end in murder he sat there for a long time gazing out at the water trying not to think about his godfather or to remember that it wa directly across from here on the opposite bank that sirius had collapsed trying to fend off a hundred dementors the sun had fallen before he realized that he wa cold he got up and returned to the castle wiping his face on his sleeve a he went page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling ron and hermione left the hospital wing completely cured three day before the end of term hermione showed sign of wanting to talk about sirius but ron tended to make hushing noise every time she mentioned his name harry wa not sure whether or not he wanted to talk about his godfather yet his wish varied with his mood he knew one thing though unhappy a he felt at the moment he would greatly miss hogwarts in a few day time when he wa back at number four privet drive even though he now understood exactly why he had to return there every summer he did not feel any better about it indeed he had never dreaded his return more professor umbridge left hogwarts the day before the end of term it seemed that she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime evidently hoping to depart undetected but unfortunately for her she met peeve on the way who seized his last chance to do a fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premise whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk many student ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running away down the path and the head of house tried only halfheartedly to restrain their pupil indeed professor mcgonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrance and wa clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after umbridge herself because peeve had borrowed her walking stick their last evening at school arrived most people had finished packing and were already heading down to the endofterm feast but harry had not even started just do it tomorrow said ron who wa waiting by the door of their dormitory come on i am starving i will not be long look you go ahead page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling but when the dormitory door closed behind ron harry made no effort to speed up his packing the very last thing he wanted to do wa to attend the end ofterm feast he wa worried that dumbledore would make some reference to him in his speech he wa sure to mention voldemorts return he had talked to them about it last year after all harry pulled some crumpled robe out of the very bottom of his trunk to make way for folded one and a he did so noticed a badly wrapped package lying in a corner of it he could not think what it wa doing there he bent down pulled it out from underneath his trainer and examined it he realized what it wa within second sirius had given it to him just inside the front door of twelve grimmauld place use it if you need me all right harry sank down onto his bed and unwrapped the package out fell a small square mirror it looked old it wa certainly dirty harry held it up to his face and saw his own reflection looking back at him he turned the mirror over there on the reverse side wa a scribbled note from sirius this is a twoway mirror i have got the other if you need to speak to me just say my name into it you will appear in my mirror and ill be able to talk in yours james and i used to use them when we were in separate detention and harrys heart began to race he remembered seeing his dead parent in the mirror of erised four year ago he wa going to be able to talk to sirius again right now he knew it page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling he looked around to make sure there wa nobody else there the dormitory wa quite empty he looked back at the mirror raised it in front of his face with trembling hand and said loudly and clearly sirius his breath misted the surface of the glass he held the mirror even closer excitement flooding through him but the eye blinking back at him through the fog were definitely his own he wiped the mirror clear again and said so that every syllable rang clearly through the room sirius black nothing happened the frustrated face looking back out of the mirror wa still definitely his own sirius did not have his mirror on him when he went through the archway said a small voice in harrys head that is why it not working harry remained quite still for a moment then hurled the mirror back into the trunk where it shattered he had been convinced for a whole shining minute that he wa going to see sirius talk to him again disappointment wa burning in his throat he got up and began throwing his thing pellmell into the trunk on top of the broken mirror but then an idea struck him a better idea than a mirror a much bigger more important idea how had he never thought of it before why had he never asked he wa sprinting out of the dormitory and down the spiral staircase hitting the wall a he ran and barely noticing he hurtled across the empty common room page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling through the portrait hole and off along the corridor ignoring the fat lady who called after him the feast is about to start you know you are cutting it very fine but harry had no intention of going to the feast how could it be that the place wa full of ghost whenever you did not need one yet now he ran down staircase and along corridor and met nobody either alive or dead they were all clearly in the great hall outside his charm classroom he came to a halt panting and thinking disconsolately that he would have to wait until later until after the end of the feast but just a he had given up hope he saw it a translucent somebody drifting across the end of the corridor hey hey nick nick the ghost stuck it head back out of the wall revealing the extravagantly plumed hat and dangerously wobbling head of sir nicholas de mimsy porpington good evening he said withdrawing the rest of his body from the solid stone and smiling at harry i am not the only one who is late then though he sighed in rather different sens of course nick can i ask you something a most peculiar expression stole over nearly headless nick face a he inserted a finger in the stiff ruff at his neck and tugged it a little straighter apparently to give himself thinking time he desisted only when his page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling partially severed neck seemed about to give way completely er now harry said nick looking discomforted can not it wait until after the feast no nick please said harry i really need to talk to you can we go in here harry opened the door of the nearest classroom and nearly headless nick sighed oh very well he said looking resigned i can not pretend i have not been expecting it harry wa holding the door open for him but he drifted through the wall instead expecting what harry asked a he closed the door you to come and find me said nick now gliding over to the window and looking out at the darkening ground it happens sometimes when somebody ha suffered a loss well said harry refusing to be deflected you were right i have i have come to find you nick said nothing it said harry who wa finding this more awkward than he had anticipated it just you are dead but you are still here are not you nick sighed and continued to gaze out at the ground that is right is not it harry urged him you died but i am talking to you you can walk around hogwarts and everything can not you page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling yes said nearly headless nick quietly i walk and talk yes so you came back did not you said harry urgently people can come back right a ghost they do not have to disappear completely well he added impatiently when nick continued to say nothing nearly headless nick hesitated then said not everyone can come back a a ghost what dyou mean said harry quickly only only wizard oh said harry and he almost laughed with relief well that is okay then the person i am asking about is a wizard so he can come back right nick turned away from the window and looked mournfully at harry he will not come back who sirius black said nick but you did said harry angrily you came back you are dead and you did not disappear wizard can leave an imprint of themselves upon the earth to walk palely where their living self once trod said nick miserably but very few wizard choose that path why not said harry anyway it doe not matter sirius will not care if it unusual hell come back i know he will page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling and so strong wa his belief that harry actually turned his head to check the door sure for a split second that he wa going to see sirius pearly white and transparent but beaming walking through it toward him he will not come back repeated nick quietly he will have gone on what dyou mean gone on said harry quickly gone on where listen what happens when you die anyway where do you go why doe not everyone come back why is not this place full of ghost why i can not answer said nick you are dead are not you said harry exasperatedly who can answer better than you i wa afraid of death said nick i chose to remain behind i sometimes wonder whether i ought not to have well that is neither here nor there in fact i am neither here nor there he gave a small sad chuckle i know nothing of the secret of death harry for i chose my feeble imitation of life instead i believe learned wizard study the matter in the department of mystery do not talk to me about that place said harry fiercely i am sorry not to have been more help said nick gently well well do excuse me the feast you know and he left the room leaving harry there alone gazing blankly at the wall through which nick had disappeared page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry felt almost a though he had lost his godfather all over again in losing the hope that he might be able to see or speak to him once more he walked slowly and miserably back up through the empty castle wondering whether he would ever feel cheerful again he had turned the corner toward the fat lady corridor when he saw somebody up ahead fastening a note to a board on the wall a second glance showed him that it wa luna there were no good hiding place nearby she wa bound to have heard his footstep and in any case harry could hardly muster the energy to avoid anyone at the moment hello said luna vaguely glancing around at him a she stepped back from the notice how come you are not at the feast harry asked well i have lost most of my possession said luna serenely people take them and hide them you know but a it the last night i really do need them back so i have been putting up sign she gestured toward the notice board upon which sure enough she had pinned a list of all her missing book and clothes with a plea for their return an odd feeling rose in harry an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since sirius death it wa a few moment before he realized that he wa feeling sorry for luna how come people hide your stuff he asked her frowning oh well she shrugged i think they think i am a bit odd you know some people call me loony lovegood actually page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling harry looked at her and the new feeling of pity intensified rather painfully that is no reason for them to take your thing he said flatly dyou want help finding them oh no she said smiling at him they will come back they always do in the end it wa just that i wanted to pack tonight anyway why are not you at the feast harry shrugged just did not feel like it no said luna observing him with those oddly misty protuberant eye i do not suppose you do that man the death eater killed wa your godfather wa not he ginny told me harry nodded curtly but found that for some reason he did not mind luna talking about sirius he had just remembered that she too could see thestrals have you he began i mean who ha anyone you have known ever died yes said luna simply my mother she wa a quite extraordinary witch you know but she did like to experiment and one of her spell went rather badly wrong one day i wa nine i am sorry harry mumbled yes it wa rather horrible said luna conversationally i still feel very sad about it sometimes but i have still got dad and anyway it not a though ill never see mum again is it er is not it said harry uncertainly page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling she shook her head in disbelief oh come on you heard them just behind the veil did not you you mean in that room with the archway they were just lurking out of sight that is all you heard them they looked at each other luna wa smiling slightly harry did not know what to say or to think luna believed so many extraordinary thing yet he had been sure he had heard voice behind the veil too are you sure you do not want me to help you look for your stuff he said oh no said luna no i think ill just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up it always doe in the end well have a nice holiday harry yeah yeah you too she walked away from him and a he watched her go he found that the terrible weight in his stomach seemed to have lessened slightly the journey home on the hogwarts express next day wa eventful in several way firstly malfoy crabbe and goyle who had clearly been waiting all week for the opportunity to strike without teacher witness attempted to ambush harry halfway down the train a he made his way back from the toilet the attack might have succeeded had it not been for the fact that they unwittingly chose to stage the attack right outside a compartment full of da member who saw what wa happening through the glass and rose a one to rush to harrys aid by the time ernie macmillan hannah abbott susan bone justin page llooharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling finchfletchley anthony goldstein and terry boot had finished using a wide variety of the hex and jinx harry had taught them malfoy crabbe and goyle resembled nothing so much a three gigantic slug squeezed into hogwarts uniform a harry ernie and justin hoisted them into the luggage rack and left them there to ooze i must say i am looking forward to seeing malfoys mother face when he get off the train said ernie with some satisfaction a he watched malfoy squirm above him ernie had never quite got over the indignity of malfoy docking point from hufflepuff during his brief spell a a member of the inquisitorial squad goyles mumll be really pleased though said ron who had come to investigate the source of the commotion he load betterlooking now anyway harry the food trolley just stopped if you want anything harry thanked the others and accompanied ron back to their compartment where he bought a large pile of cauldron cake and pumpkin pasty hermione wa reading the daily prophet again ginny wa doing a quiz in the quibbler and neville wa stroking his mimbulus mimbletonia which had grown a great deal over the year and now made odd crooning noise when touched harry and ron whiled away most of the journey playing wizard chess while hermione read out snippet from the prophet it wa now full of article about how to repel dementors attempt by the ministry to track down death eater and hysterical letter claiming that the writer had seen lord voldemort walking past their house that very morning page llolharry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling it ha not really started yet sighed hermione gloomily folding up the newspaper again but it will not be long now hey harry said ron nodding toward the glass window onto the corridor harry looked around cho wa passing accompanied by marietta edgecombe who wa wearing a balaclava his and chos eye met for a moment cho blushed and kept walking harry looked back down at the chessboard just in time to see one of his pawn chased off it square by ron knight what is er going on with you and her anyway ron asked quietly nothing said harry truthfully i er heard she is going out with someone else now said hermione tentatively harry wa surprised to find that this information did not hurt at all wanting to impress cho seemed to belong to a past that wa no longer quite connected with him so much of what he had wanted before sirius death felt that way these day the week that had elapsed since he had last seen sirius seemed to have lasted much much longer it stretched across two universe the one with sirius in it and the one without you are well out of it mate said ron forcefully i mean she is quite goodlooking and all that but you want someone a bit more cheerful she is probably cheerful enough with someone else said harry shrugging page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling who is she with now anyway ron asked hermione but it wa ginny who answered michael corner she said michael but said ron craning around in his seat to stare at her but you were going out with him not anymore said ginny resolutely he did not like gryffindor beating ravenclaw at quidditch and got really sulky so i ditched him and he ran off to comfort cho instead she scratched her nose absently with the end of her quill turned the quibbler upside down and began marking her answer ron looked highly delighted well i always thought he wa a bit of an idiot he said prodding his queen forward toward harrys quivering castle good for you just choose someone better next time he cast harry an oddly furtive look a he said it well i have chosen dean thomas would you say he better asked ginny vaguely what shouted ron upending the chessboard crookshanks went plunging after the piece and hedwig and pigwidgeon twittered and hooted angrily from overhead a the train slowed down in the approach to king cross harry thought he had never wanted to leave it le he even wondered fleetingly what would happen if he simply refused to get off but remained stubbornly sitting there until the first of september when it would take him back to hogwarts when it finally puffed to a standstill however he lifted down page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling hedwigs cage and prepared to drag his trunk from the train a usual when the ticket inspector signaled to him ron and hermione that it wa safe to walk through the magical barrier between platform nine and ten however he found a surprise awaiting him on the other side a group of people standing there to greet him whom he had not expected at all there wa madeye moody looking quite a sinister with his bowler hat pulled low over his magical eye a he would have done without it his gnarled hand clutching a long staff his body wrapped in a voluminous traveling cloak tonks stood just behind him her bright bubblegumpink hair gleaming in the sunlight filtering through the dirty glass station ceiling wearing heavily patched jean and a bright purple tshirt bearing the legend the weird sister next to tonks wa lupin his face pale his hair graying a long and threadbare overcoat covering a shabby jumper and trouser at the front of the group stood mr and mr weasley dressed in their muggle best and fred and george who were both wearing brandnew jacket in some lurid green scaly material ron ginny called mr weasley hurrying forward and hugging her child tightly oh and harry dear how are you fine lied harry a she pulled him into a tight embrace over her shoulder he saw ron goggling at the twin new clothes what are they supposed to be he asked pointing at the jacket page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling finest dragon skin little bro said fred giving his zip a little tweak business is booming and we thought wed treat ourselves hello harry said lupin a mr weasley let go of harry and turned to greet hermione hi said harry i did not expect what are you all doing here well said lupin with a slight smile we thought we might have a little chat with your aunt and uncle before letting them take you home i do not know if that is a good idea said harry at once oh i think it is growled moody who had limped a little closer that will be them will it potter he pointed with his thumb over his shoulder his magical eye wa evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where madeye wa pointing and there sure enough were the three dursleys who looked positively appalled to see harrys reception committee ah harry said mr weasley turning from hermiones parent whom he had been greeting enthusiastically and who were taking it in turn to hug hermione well shall we do it then yeah i reckon so arthur said moody he and mr weasley took the lead across the station toward the place where the dursleys stood apparently rooted to the floor hermione disengaged herself gently from her mother to join the group page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling good afternoon said mr weasley pleasantly to uncle vernon coming to a halt right in front of him you might remember me my name arthur weasley a mr weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the dursleys living room two year previously harry would have been very surprised if uncle vernon had forgotten him sure enough uncle vernon turned a deeper shade of puce and glared at mr weasley but chose not to say anything partly perhaps because the dursleys were outnumbered two to one aunt petunia looked both frightened and embarrassed she kept glancing around a though terrified somebody she knew would see her in such company dudley meanwhile seemed to be trying to look small and insignificant a feat at which he wa failing extravagantly we thought wed just have a few word with you about harry said mr weasley still smiling yeah growled moody about how he treated when he at your place uncle vernons mustache seemed to bristle with indignation possibly because the bowler hat gave him the entirely mistaken impression that he wa dealing with a kindred spirit he addressed himself to moody i am not aware that it is any of your business what go on in my house i expect what you are not aware of would fill several book dursley growled moody anyway that is not the point interjected tonks whose pink hair seemed to offend aunt petunia more than all the rest put together for she closed her eye page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling rather than look at her the point is if we find out you have been horrible to harry and make no mistake well hear about it added lupin pleasantly yes said mr weasley even if you will not let harry use the fellytone telephone whispered hermione yeah if we get any hint that potter been mistreated in any way you will have u to answer to said moody uncle vernon swelled ominously his sense of outrage seemed to outweigh even his fear of this bunch of oddball are you threatening me sir he said so loudly that passersby actually turned to stare yes i am said madeye who seemed rather pleased that uncle vernon had grasped this fact so quickly and do i look like the kind of man who can be intimidated barked uncle vernon well said moody pushing back his bowler hat to reveal his sinisterly revolving magical eye uncle vernon leapt backward in horror and collided painfully with a luggage trolley yes id have to say you do dursley he turned from uncle vernon to harry so potter give u a shout if you need u if we do not hear from you for three day in a row well send someone along page harry potter and the order of the phoenix jk rowling aunt petunia whimpered piteously it could not have been plainer that she wa thinking of what the neighbor would say if they caught sight of these people marching up the garden path tye then potter said moody grasping harrys shoulder for a moment with a gnarled hand take care harry said lupin quietly keep in touch harry well have you away from there a soon a we can mr weasley whispered hugging him again well see you soon mate said ron anxiously shaking harrys hand really soon harry said hermione earnestly we promise harry nodded he somehow could not find word to tell them what it meant to him to see them all ranged there on his side instead he smiled raised a hand in farewell turned around and led the way out of the station toward the sunlit street with uncle vernon aunt petunia and dudley hurrying along in his wake page
