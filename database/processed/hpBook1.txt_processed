mr and mr dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people you would expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just did not hold with such nonsense mr dursley wa the director of a firm called grunnings which made drill he wa a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mr dursley wa thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful a she spent so much of her time craning over garden fence spying on the neighbor the dursley s had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there wa no finer boy anywhere the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear wa that somebody would discover it they did not think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potter mr potter wa mr dursleys sister but they had not page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling met for several year in fact mr dursley pretended she did not have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were a undursleyish a it wa possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbor would say if the potter arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potter had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy wa another good reason for keeping the potter away they did not want dudley mixing with a child like that when mr and mr dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story start there wa nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious thing would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed a he picked out his most boring tie for work and mr dursley gossiped away happily a she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mr dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley wa now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the wall little tyke chortled mr dursley a he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number four drive it wa on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley did not realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there wa a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wa not a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the cat it stared back a mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it wa now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cat could not read map or sign mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind a he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drill he wa hoping to get that day but on the edge of town drill were driven out of his mind by something else a he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he could not help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloak mr dursley could not bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getup you saw on young people he supposed this wa some stupid new fashion he drummed his finger on the steering wheel and his eye fell on a huddle of these weirdo standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley wa enraged to see that a couple of them were not young at all why that man had to be older than he wa and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this wa probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something yes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minute later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drill mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he had not he might have found it harder to concentrate on drill that morning he did not see the owl swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed openmouthed a owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling call and shouted a bit more he wa in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he would stretch his leg and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery he would forgotten all about the people in cloak until he passed a group of them next to the baker he eyed them angrily a he passed he did not know why but they made him uneasy this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he could not see a single collecting tin it wa on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few word of what they were saying the potter that is right that is what i heard yes their son harry mr dursley stopped dead fear flooded him he looked back at the whisperer a if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking no he wa being stupid potter wa not such an unusual name he wa sure there were lot of people called potter who had a son called harry come to think of it he wa not even sure his nephew wa called harry he would never even seen the boy it might have been harvey or harold there wa no point in worrying mr dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister he did not blame her if he would had a sister like that but all the same those people in cloak page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drill that afternoon and when he left the building at five of the clock he wa still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door sorry he grunted a the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell it wa a few second before mr dursley realized that the man wa wearing a violet cloak he did not seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare do not be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today rejoice for you knowwho ha gone at last even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day and the old man hugged mr dursley around the middle and walked off mr dursley stood rooted to the spot he had been hugged by a complete stranger he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that wa he wa rattled he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he wa imagining thing which he had never hoped before because he did not approve of imagination a he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it did not improve his mood wa the tabby cat he would spotted that morning it wa now sitting on his garden wall he wa sure it wa the same one it had the same marking around it eye shoo said mr dursley loudly the cat did not move it just gave him a stern look wa this normal cat behavior mr dursley wondered trying to pull himself together he let himself into the page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling house he wa still determined not to mention anything to his wife mr dursley had had a nice normal day she told him over dinner all about mr next door problem with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word will not mr dursley tried to act normally when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nation owl have been behaving very unusually today although owl normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundred of sighting of these bird flying in every direction since sunrise expert are unable to explain why the owl have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern the newscaster allowed himself a grin most mysterious and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather going to be any more shower of owl tonight jim well ted said the weatherman i do not know about that but it not only the owl that have been acting oddly today viewer a far apart a kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday they have had a downpour of shooting star perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it not until next week folk but i can promise a wet night tonight mr dursley sat frozen in his armchair shooting star all over britain owl flying by daylight mysterious people in cloak all over the place and a whisper a whisper about the potter page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling mr dursley came into the living room carrying two cup of tea it wa no good he would have to say something to her he cleared his throat nervously er petunia dear you have not heard from your sister lately have you a he had expected mr dursley looked shocked and angry after all they normally pretended she did not have a sister no she said sharply why funny stuff on the news mr dursley mumbled owl shooting star and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town today so snapped mr dursley well i just thought maybe it wa something to do with you know her crowd mr dursley sipped her tea through pursed lip mr dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he would heard the name potter he decided he did not dare instead he said a casually a he could their son he would be about dudleys age now would not he i suppose so said mr dursley stiffly what is his name again howard is not it harry nasty common name if you ask me oh yes said mr dursley his heart sinking horribly yes i quite agree he did not say another word on the subject a they went upstairs to bed while mr dursley wa in the bathroom mr dursley crept to the bedroom window page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling and peered down into the front garden the cat wa still there it wa staring down privet drive a though it were waiting for something wa he imagining thing could all this have anything to do with the potter if it did if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he did not think he could bear it the dursleys got into bed mr dursley fell asleep quickly but mr dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind his last comforting thought before he fell asleep wa that even if the potter were involved there wa no reason for them to come near him and mr dursley the potter knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind he could not see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it could not affect them how very wrong he wa mr dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside wa showing no sign of sleepiness it wa sitting a still a a statue it eye fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive it did not so much a quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owl swooped overhead in fact it wa nearly midnight before the cat moved at all a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently you would have thought he would just popped out of the ground the cat tail twitched and it eye narrowed nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive he wa tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling enough to tuck into his belt he wa wearing long robe a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boot his blue eye were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacle and his nose wa very long and crooked a though it had been broken at least twice this man name wa albus dumbledore albus dumbledore did not seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boot wa unwelcome he wa busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something but he did seem to realize he wa being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which wa still staring at him from the other end of the street for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him he chuckled and muttered i should have known he found what he wa looking for in his inside pocket it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness twelve time he clicked the putouter until the only light left on the whole street were two tiny pinprick in the distance which were the eye of the cat watching him if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mr dursley they would not be able to see anything that wa happening down on the pavement dumbledore slipped the put outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat he did not look at it but after a moment he spoke to it fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone instead he wa smiling at a rather severelooking woman who wa wearing square glass exactly the shape of the marking the cat had had around it eye she too wa wearing a cloak an emerald one her black hair wa drawn into a tight bun she looked distinctly ruffled how did you know it wa me she asked my dear professor i have never seen a cat sit so stiffly you would be stiff if you would been sitting on a brick wall all day said professor mcgonagall all day when you could have been celebrating i must have passed a dozen feast and party on my way here professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily oh yes everyone is celebrating all right she said impatiently you would think they would be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed something is going on it wa on their news she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window i heard it flock of owl shooting star well they are not completely stupid they were bound to notice something shooting star down in kent ill bet that wa dedalus diggle he never had much sense you can not blame them said dumbledore gently we have had precious little to celebrate for eleven year i know that said professor mcgonagall irritably but that is no reason to lose our head people are being downright careless out on the street in broad page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumor she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here a though hoping he wa going to tell her something but he did not so she went on a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about u all i suppose he really ha gone dumbledore it certainly seems so said dumbledore we have much to be thankful for would you care for a lemon drop a what a lemon drop they are a kind of muggle sweet i am rather fond of no thank you said professor mcgonagall coldly a though she did not think this wa the moment for lemon drop a i say even if youknowwho ha gone my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name all this you knowwho nonsense for eleven year i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who wa unsticking two lemon drop seemed not to notice it all get so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemorts name i know you have not said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring but you are different everyone know you are the only one you know oh all right voldemort wa frightened of page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you flatter me said dumbledore calmly voldemort had power i will never have only because you are too well noble to use them it lucky it dark i have not blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuff professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said the owl are nothing next to the rumor that are flying around you know what everyone is saying about why he disappeared about what finally stopped him it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she wa most anxious to discus the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither a a cat nor a a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare a she did now it wa plain that whatever everyone wa saying she wa not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it wa true dumbledore however wa choosing another lemon drop and did not answer what they are saying she pressed on is that last night voldemort turned up in godrics hollow he went to find the potter the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that they are dead dumbledore bowed his head professor mcgonagall gasped lily and james i can not believe it i did not want to believe it oh albus dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder i know i know he said heavily page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling professor mcgonagalls voice trembled a she went on that is not all they are saying he tried to kill the potter son harry but he could not he could not kill that little boy no one know why or how but they are saying that when he could not kill harry potter voldemorts power somehow broke and that is why he gone dumbledore nodded glumly it it true faltered professor mcgonagall after all he done all the people he killed he could not kill a little boy it just astounding of all the thing to stop him but how in the name of heaven did harry survive we can only guess said dumbledore we may never know professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eye beneath her spectacle dumbledore gave a great sniff a he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it it wa a very odd watch it had twelve hand but no number instead little planet were moving around the edge it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said hagrids late i suppose it wa he who told you id be here by the way yes said professor mcgonagall and i do not suppose you are going to tell me why you are here of all place i have come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle they are the only family he ha left now you do not mean you can not mean the people who live here cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling foot and pointing at number four dumbledore you can not i have been watching them all day you could not find two people who are le like u and they have got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweet harry potter come and live here it the best place for him said dumbledore firmly his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he older i have written them a letter a letter repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter these people will never understand him hell be famous a legend i would not be surprised if today wa known a harry potter day in the future there will be book written about harry every child in our world will know his name exactly said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glass it would be enough to turn any boy head famous before he can walk and talk famous for something he will not even remember can not you see how much better off hell be growing up away from all that until he ready to take it professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said yes yes you are right of course but how is the boy getting here dumbledore she eyed his cloak suddenly a though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it hagrids bringing him you think it wise to trust hagrid with something a important a this page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i would trust hagrid with my life said dumbledore i am not saying his heart is not in the right place said professor mcgonagall grudgingly but you can not pretend he not careless he doe tend to what wa that a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them it grew steadily louder a they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar a they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them if the motorcycle wa huge it wa nothing to the man sitting astride it he wa almost twice a tall a a normal man and at least five time a wide he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangle of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hand the size of trash can lid and his foot in their leather boot were like baby dolphin in his vast muscular arm he wa holding a bundle of blanket hagrid said dumbledore sounding relieved at last and where did you get that motorcycle borrowed it professor dumbledore sir said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle a he spoke young sirius black lent it to me i have got him sir no problem were there no sir house wa almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around he fell asleep a we wa flyin over bristol page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blanket inside just visible wa a baby boy fast asleep under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning is that where whispered professor mcgonagall yes said dumbledore hell have that scar forever could not you do something about it dumbledore even if i could i would not scar can come in handy i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground well give him here hagrid wed better get this over with dumbledore took harry in his arm and turned toward the dursleys house could i could i say goodbye to him sir asked hagrid he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog shhh hissed professor mcgonagall you will wake the muggles sssorry sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it but i cc can not stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles yes yes it all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or well be found professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm a dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door he laid harry gently on the page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harrys blanket and then came back to the other two for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrids shoulder shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledores eye seemed to have gone out well said dumbledore finally that is that we have no business staying here we may a well go and join the celebration yeah said hagrid in a very muffled voice id best get this bike away g night professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir wiping his streaming eye on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall said dumbledore nodding to her professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply dumbledore turned and walked back down the street on the corner he stopped and took out the silver put outer he clicked it once and twelve ball of light sped back to their street lamp so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street he could just see the bundle of blanket on the step of number four good luck harry he murmured he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he wa gone a breeze ruffled the neat hedge of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling place you would expect astonishing thing to happen harry potter rolled over inside his blanket without waking up one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he wa special not knowing he wa famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hour time by mr dursleys scream a she opened the front door to put out the milk bottle nor that he would spend the next few week being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley he could not know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glass and saying in hushed voice to harry potter the boy who lived page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the vanashig glass nearly ten year had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all the sun rose on the same tidy front garden and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which wa almost exactly the same a it had been on the night when mr dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owl only the photograph on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed ten year ago there had been lot of picture of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnet but dudley dursley wa no longer a baby and now the photograph showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too yet harry potter wa still there asleep at the moment but not for long his aunt petunia wa awake and it page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling wa her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day up get up now harry woke with a start his aunt rapped on the door again up she screeched harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having it had been a good one there had been a flying motorcycle in it he had a funny feeling he would had the same dream before his aunt wa back outside the door are you up yet she demanded nearly said harry well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon and do not you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddys birthday harry groaned what did you say his aunt snapped through the door nothing nothing dudleys birthday how could he have forgotten harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for sock he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on harry wa used to spider because the cupboard under the stair wa full of them and that wa where he slept page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling when he wa dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen the table wa almost hidden beneath all dudleys birthday present it looked a though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike wa a mystery to harry a dudley wa very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody dudleys favorite punching bag wa harry but he could not often catch him harry did not look it but he wa very fast perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really wa because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudleys and dudley wa about four time bigger than he wa harry had a thin face knobbly knee black hair and bright green eye he wore round glass held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the time dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance wa a very thin scar on his forehead that wa shaped like a bolt of lightning he had had it a long a he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia wa how he had gotten it in the car crash when your parent died she had said and do not ask question do not ask question that wa the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys uncle vernon entered the kitchen a harry wa turning over the bacon comb your hair he barked by way of a morning greeting page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut harry must have had more haircut than the rest of the boy in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place harry wa frying egg by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eye and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig harry put the plate of egg and bacon on the table which wa difficult a there wa not much room dudley meanwhile wa counting his present his face fell thirtysix he said looking up at his mother and father that is two le than last year darling you have not counted auntie marge present see it here under this big one from mommy and daddy all right thirtyseven then said dudley going red in the face harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon a fast a possible in case dudley turned the table over aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly and well buy you another two present while were out today how is that popkin two more present is that all right page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling dudley thought for a moment it looked like hard work finally he said slowly so ill have thirty thirty thirtynine sweetums said aunt petunia oh dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel all right then uncle vernon chuckled little tyke want his money worth just like his father atta boy dudley he ruffled dudleys hair at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer game and a vcr he wa ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried bad news vernon she said mr figgs broken her leg she can not take him she jerked her head in harrys direction dudleys mouth fell open in horror but harrys heart gave a leap every year on dudleys birthday his parent took him and a friend out for the day to adventure park hamburger restaurant or the movie every year harry wa left behind with mr figg a mad old lady who lived two street away harry hated it there the whole house smelled of cabbage and mr figg made him look at photograph of all the cat she would ever owned now what said aunt petunia looking furiously at harry a though he would planned this harry knew he page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling ought to feel sorry that mr figg had broken her leg but it wa not easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at tibbies snowy mr paw and tufty again we could phone marge uncle vernon suggested do not be silly vernon she hate the boy the dursleys often spoke about harry like this a though he wa not there or rather a though he wa something very nasty that could not understand them like a slug what about whatshername your friend yvonne on vacation in majorca snapped aunt petunia you could just leave me here harry put in hopefully he would be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on dudleys computer aunt petunia looked a though she would just swallowed a lemon and come back and find the house in ruin she snarled i will not blow up the house said harry but they were not listening i suppose we could take him to the zoo said aunt petunia slowly and leave him in the car that car new he not sitting in it alone page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling dudley began to cry loudly in fact he wa not really cry it had been year since he would really cried but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed his mother would give him anything he wanted dinky duddydums do not cry mummy will not let him spoil your special day she cried flinging her arm around him i do not want him ttto come dudley yelled between huge pretend sob he always sp spoil everything he shot harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mother arm just then the doorbell rang oh good lord they are here said aunt petunia frantically and a moment later dudleys best friend pier polkiss walked in with his mother pier wa a scrawny boy with a face like a rat he wa usually the one who held people arm behind their back while dudley hit them dudley stopped pretending to cry at once half an hour later harry who could not believe his luck wa sitting in the back of the dursleys car with pier and dudley on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life his aunt and uncle had not been able to think of anything else to do with him but before they would left uncle vernon had taken harry aside i am warning you he had said putting his large purple face right up close to harrys i am warning you now boy any funny business anything at all and you will be in that cupboard from now until christmas i am not going to do anything said harry honestly page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling but uncle vernon did not believe him no one ever did the problem wa strange thing often happened around harry and it wa just no good telling the dursleys he did not make them happen once aunt petunia tired of harry coming back from the barber looking a though he had not been at all had taken a pair of kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he wa almost bald except for his bang which she left to hide that horrible scar dudley had laughed himself silly at harry who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day where he wa already laughed at for his baggy clothes and taped glass next morning however he had gotten up to find his hair exactly a it had been before aunt petunia had sheared it off he had been given a week in his cupboard for this even though he had tried to explain that he could not explain how it had grown back so quickly another time aunt petunia had been trying to force him into a revolting old sweater of dudleys brown with orange puff ball the harder she tried to pull it over his head the smaller it seemed to become until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet but certainly would not fit harry aunt petunia had decided it must have shrunk in the wash and to his great relief harry wa not punished on the other hand he would gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchen dudleys gang had been chasing him a usual when a much to harrys surprise a anyone el there he wa sitting on the chimney the dursleys had received a very angry letter from harrys headmistress telling them harry had been climbing school building but all he would tried to do a he shouted at uncle vernon through the locked door of his page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling cupboard wa jump behind the big trash can outside the kitchen door harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in midjump but today nothing wa going to go wrong it wa even worth being with dudley and pier to be spending the day somewhere that wa not school his cupboard or mr figgs cabbagesmelling living room while he drove uncle vernon complained to aunt petunia he liked to complain about thing people at work harry the council harry the bank and harry were just a few of his favorite subject this morning it wa motorcycle roaring along like maniac the young hoodlum he said a a motorcycle overtook them i had a dream about a motorcycle said harry remembering suddenly it wa flying uncle vernon nearly crashed into the car in front he turned right around in his seat and yelled at harry his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache motorcycle do not fly dudley and pier sniggered i know they do not said harry it wa only a dream but he wished he had not said anything if there wa one thing the dursleys hated even more than his asking question it wa his talking about anything acting in a way it should not no matter if it wa in a dream or even a cartoon they seemed to think he might get dangerous idea it wa a very sunny saturday and the zoo wa crowded with family the dursleys bought dudley page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling and pier large chocolate ice cream at the entrance and then because the smiling lady in the van had asked harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop it wa not bad either harry thought licking it a they watched a gorilla scratching it head who looked remarkably like dudley except that it wa not blond harry had the best morning he would had in a long time he wa careful to walk a little way apart from the dursleys so that dudley and pier who were starting to get bored with the animal by lunchtime would not fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him they ate in the zoo restaurant and when dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory did not have enough ice cream on top uncle vernon bought him another one and harry wa allowed to finish the first harry felt afterward that he should have known it wa all too good to last after lunch they went to the reptile house it wa cool and dark in there with lit window all along the wall behind the glass all sort of lizard and snake were crawling and slithering over bit of wood and stone dudley and pier wanted to see huge poisonous cobra and thick mancrushing python dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place it could have wrapped it body twice around uncle vernons car and crushed it into a trash can but at the moment it did not look in the mood in fact it wa fast asleep dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass staring at the glistening brown coil make it move he whined at his father uncle vernon tapped on the glass but the snake did not budge page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling do it again dudley ordered uncle vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckle but the snake just snoozed on this is boring dudley moaned he shuffled away harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake he would not have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself no company except stupid people drumming their finger on the glass trying to disturb it all day long it wa worse than having a cupboard a a bedroom where the only visitor wa aunt petunia hammering on the door to wake you up at least he got to visit the rest of the house the snake suddenly opened it beady eye slowly very slowly it raised it head until it eye were on a level with harrys it winked harry stared then he looked quickly around to see if anyone wa watching they were not he looked back at the snake and winked too the snake jerked it head toward uncle vernon and dudley then raised it eye to the ceiling it gave harry a look that said quite plainly i get that all the time i know harry murmured through the glass though he wa not sure the snake could hear him it must be really annoying the snake nodded vigorously where do you come from anyway harry asked page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the snake jabbed it tail at a little sign next to the glass harry peered at it boa constrictor brazil wa it nice there the boa constrictor jabbed it tail at the sign again and harry read on this specimen wa bred in the zoo oh i see so you have never been to brazil a the snake shook it head a deafening shout behind harry made both of them jump dudley mr dursley come and look at this snake you will not believe what it doing dudley came waddling toward them a fast a he could out of the way you he said punching harry in the rib caught by surprise harry fell hard on the concrete floor what came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened one second pier and dudley were leaning right up close to the glass the next they had leapt back with howl of horror harry sat up and gasped the glass front of the boa constrictor tank had vanished the great snake wa uncoiling itself rapidly slithering out onto the floor people throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exit a the snake slid swiftly past him harry could have sworn a low hissing voice said brazil here i come thanks amigo the keeper of the reptile house wa in shock page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling but the glass he kept saying where did the glass go the zoo director himself made aunt petunia a cup of strong sweet tea while he apologized over and over again pier and dudley could only gibber a far a harry had seen the snake had not done anything except snap playfully at their heel a it passed but by the time they were all back in uncle vernons car dudley wa telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg while pier wa swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death but worst of all for harry at least wa pier calming down enough to say harry wa talking to it were not you harry uncle vernon waited until pier wa safely out of the house before starting on harry he wa so angry he could hardly speak he managed to say go cupboard stay no meal before he collapsed into a chair and aunt petunia had to run and get him a large brandy harry lay in his dark cupboard much later wishing he had a watch he did not know what time it wa and he could not be sure the dursleys were asleep yet until they were he could not risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food he would lived with the dursleys almost ten year ten miserable year a long a he could remember ever since he would been a baby and his parent had died in that car crash he could not remember being in the car when his parent had died sometimes when he strained his memory during long hour in his cupboard he came up with a strange vision a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead this he supposed wa the crash though he could not imagine where all the green light came from he could not remember his parent at all his page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling aunt and uncle never spoke about them and of course he wa forbidden to ask question there were no photograph of them in the house when he had been younger harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown relation coming to take him away but it had never happened the dursleys were his only family yet sometimes he thought or maybe hoped that stranger in the street seemed to know him very strange stranger they were too a tiny man in a violet top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with aunt petunia and dudley after asking harry furiously if he knew the man aunt petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything a wildlooking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus a bald man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word the weirdest thing about all these people wa the way they seemed to vanish the second harry tried to get a closer look at school harry had no one everybody knew that dudleys gang hated that odd harry potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glass and nobody liked to disagree with dudleys gang page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the letter from no one the escape of the brazilian boa constrictor earned harry his longestever punishment by the time he wa allowed out of his cupboard again the summer holiday had started and dudley had already broken his new video camera crashed his remote control airplane and first time out on his racing bike knocked down old mr figg a she crossed privet drive on her crutch harry wa glad school wa over but there wa no escaping dudleys gang who visited the house every single day pier dennis malcolm and gordon were all big and stupid but a dudley wa the biggest and stupidest of the lot he wa the leader the rest of them were all quite happy to join in dudleys favorite sport harry hunting this wa why harry spent a much time a possible out of the house wandering around and thinking about the end of the holiday where he could see a tiny ray of hope when september came he would be going off to secondary school and for the first time in page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling his life he would not be with dudley dudley had been accepted at uncle vernons old private school smeltings pier polkiss wa going there too harry on the other hand wa going to stonewall high the local public school dudley thought this wa very funny they stuff people head down the toilet the first day at stonewall he told harry want to come upstairs and practice no thanks said harry the poor toilet never had anything a horrible a your head down it it might be sick then he ran before dudley could work out what he would said one day in july aunt petunia took dudley to london to buy his smeltings uniform leaving harry at mr figgs mr figg wa not a bad a usual it turned out she would broken her leg tripping over one of her cat and she did not seem quite a fond of them a before she let harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted a though she would had it for several year that evening dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brandnew uniform smeltings boy wore maroon tailcoat orange knickerbockers and flat straw hat called boater they also carried knobbly stick used for hitting each other while the teacher were not looking this wa supposed to be good training for later life a he looked at dudley in his new knickerbockers uncle vernon said gruffly that it wa the proudest moment of his life aunt petunia burst into tear and said she could not believe it wa her ickle dudleykins he looked so handsome and grownup harry did not page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling trust himself to speak he thought two of his rib might already have cracked from trying not to laugh k k k there wa a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when harry went in for breakfast it seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink he went to have a look the tub wa full of what looked like dirty rag swimming in gray water what is this he asked aunt petunia her lip tightened a they always did if he dared to ask a question your new school uniform she said harry looked in the bowl again oh he said i did not realize it had to be so wet do not be stupid snapped aunt petunia i am dyeing some of dudleys old thing gray for you it will look just like everyone el when i have finished harry seriously doubted this but thought it best not to argue he sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he wa going to look on his first day at stonewall high like he wa wearing bit of old elephant skin probably dudley and uncle vernon came in both with wrinkled nose because of the smell from harrys new uniform uncle vernon opened his newspaper a usual and dudley banged his smelting stick which he carried everywhere on the table they heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letter on the doormat page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling get the mail dudley said uncle vernon from behind his paper make harry get it get the mail harry make dudley get it poke him with your smelting stick dudley harry dodged the smelting stick and went to get the mail three thing lay on the doormat a postcard from uncle vernons sister marge who wa vacationing on the isle of wight a brown envelope that looked like a bill and a letter for harry harry picked it up and stared at it his heart twanging like a giant elastic band no one ever in his whole life had written to him who would he had no friend no other relative he did not belong to the library so he would never even got rude note asking for book back yet here it wa a letter addressed so plainly there could be no mistake mr h potter the cupboard under the stair privet drive little whinging surrey the envelope wa thick and heavy made of yellowish parchment and the address wa written in emerald green ink there wa no stamp page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling turning the envelope over his hand trembling harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arm a lion an eagle a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter h hurry up boy shouted uncle vernon from the kitchen what are you doing checking for letter bomb he chuckled at his own joke harry went back to the kitchen still staring at his letter he handed uncle vernon the bill and the postcard sat down and slowly began to open the yellow envelope uncle vernon ripped open the bill snorted in disgust and flipped over the postcard marge ill he informed aunt petunia ate a funny whelk dad said dudley suddenly dad harrys got something harry wa on the point of unfolding his letter which wa written on the same heavy parchment a the envelope when it wa jerked sharply out of his hand by uncle vernon that is mine said harry trying to snatch it back who would be writing to you sneered uncle vernon shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it his face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic light and it did not stop there within second it wa the grayish white of old porridge pppetunia he gasped page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling dudley tried to grab the letter to read it but uncle vernon held it high out of his reach aunt petunia took it curiously and read the first line for a moment it looked a though she might faint she clutched her throat and made a choking noise vernon oh my goodness vernon they stared at each other seeming to have forgotten that harry and dudley were still in the room dudley wa not used to being ignored he gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his smelting stick i want to read that letter he said loudly i want to read it said harry furiously a it mine get out both of you croaked uncle vernon stuffing the letter back inside it envelope harry did not move i want my letter he shouted let me see it demanded dudley out roared uncle vernon and he took both harry and dudley by the scruff of their neck and threw them into the hall slamming the kitchen door behind them harry and dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole dudley won so harry his glass dangling from one ear lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor vernon aunt petunia wa saying in a quivering voice look at the address how could they possibly know where he sleep you do not think they are watching the house page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling watching spying might be following u muttered uncle vernon wildly but what should we do vernon should we write back tell them we do not want harry could see uncle vernons shiny black shoe pacing up and down the kitchen no he said finally no well ignore it if they do not get an answer yes that is best we will not do anything but i am not having one in the house petunia did not we swear when we took him in wed stamp out that dangerous nonsense that evening when he got back from work uncle vernon did something he would never done before he visited harry in his cupboard where is my letter said harry the moment uncle vernon had squeezed through the door who is writing to me no one it wa addressed to you by mistake said uncle vernon shortly i have burned it it wa not a mistake said harry angrily it had my cupboard on it silence yelled uncle vernon and a couple of spider fell from the ceiling he took a few deep breath and then forced his face into a smile which looked quite painful page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling er yes harry about this cupboard your aunt and i have been thinking you are really getting a bit big for it we think it might be nice if you moved into dudleys second bedroom why said harry do not ask question snapped his uncle take this stuff upstairs now the dursleys house had four bedroom one for uncle vernon and aunt petunia one for visitor usually uncle vernons sister marge one where dudley slept and one where dudley kept all the toy and thing that would not fit into his first bedroom it only took harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room he sat down on the bed and stared around him nearly everything in here wa broken the monthold video camera wa lying on top of a small working tank dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor dog in the corner wa dudleys firstever television set which he would put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled there wa a large birdcage which had once held a parrot that dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle which wa up on a shelf with the end all bent because dudley had sat on it other shelf were full of book they were the only thing in the room that looked a though they would never been touched from downstairs came the sound of dudley bawling at his mother i do not want him in there i need that room make him get out harry sighed and stretched out on the bed yesterday he would have given anything to be up here today he would rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling next morning at breakfast everyone wa rather quiet dudley wa in shock he would screamed whacked his father with his smelting stick been sick on purpose kicked his mother and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof and he still did not have his room back harry wa thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he would opened the letter in the hall uncle vernon and aunt petunia kept looking at each other darkly when the mail arrived uncle vernon who seemed to be trying to be nice to harry made dudley go and get it they heard him banging thing with his smelting stick all the way down the hall then he shouted there is another one mr h potter the smallest bedroom privet drive with a strangled cry uncle vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall harry right behind him uncle vernon had to wrestle dudley to the ground to get the letter from him which wa made difficult by the fact that harry had grabbed uncle vernon around the neck from behind after a minute of confused fighting in which everyone got hit a lot by the smelting stick uncle vernon straightened up gasping for breath with harrys letter clutched in his hand go to your cupboard i mean your bedroom he wheezed at harry dudley go just go harry walked round and round his new room someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he had not received his first letter surely that meant they would try again and this time he would make sure they did not fail he had a plan the repaired alarm clock rang at six of the clock the next morning harry turned it off quickly and dressed page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling silently he must not wake the dursleys he stole downstairs without turning on any of the light he wa going to wait for the postman on the corner of privet drive and get the letter for number four first his heart hammered a he crept across the dark hall toward the front door aaaaarrrgh harry leapt into the air he would trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat something alive light clicked on upstairs and to his horror harry realized that the big squashy something had been his uncle face uncle vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag clearly making sure that harry did not do exactly what he would been trying to do he shouted at harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back the mail had arrived right into uncle vernons lap harry could see three letter addressed in green ink i want he began but uncle vernon wa tearing the letter into piece before his eye uncle vernon did not go to work that day he stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot see he explained to aunt petunia through a mouthful of nail if they can not deliver them they will just give up i am not sure that will work vernon oh these people mind work in strange way petunia they are not like you and me said uncle page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling vernon trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake aunt petunia had just brought him on friday no le than twelve letter arrived for harry a they could not go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door slotted through the side and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom uncle vernon stayed at home again after burning all the letter he got out a hammer and nail and boarded up the crack around the front and back door so no one could go out he hummed tiptoe through the tulip a he worked and jumped at small noise on saturday thing began to get out of hand twentyfour letter to harry found their way into the house rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen egg that their very confused milkman had handed aunt petunia through the living room window while uncle vernon made furious telephone call to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to aunt petunia shredded the letter in her food processor who on earth want to talk to you this badly dudley asked harry in amazement k k k on sunday morning uncle vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill but happy no post on sunday he reminded them cheerfully a he spread marmalade on his newspaper no damn letter today page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney a he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head next moment thirty or forty letter came pelting out of the fireplace like bullet the dursleys ducked but harry leapt into the air trying to catch one out out uncle vernon seized harry around the waist and threw him into the hall when aunt petunia and dudley had run out with their arm over their face uncle vernon slammed the door shut they could hear the letter still streaming into the room bouncing off the wall and floor that doe it said uncle vernon trying to speak calmly but pulling great tuft out of his mustache at the same time i want you all back here in five minute ready to leave were going away just pack some clothes no argument he looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue ten minute later they had wrenched their way through the boardedup door and were in the car speeding toward the highway dudley wa sniffling in the back seat his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television vcr and computer in his sport bag they drove and they drove even aunt petunia did not dare ask where they were going every now and then uncle vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while shake them off shake them off he would mutter whenever he did this page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling they did not stop to eat or drink all day by nightfall dudley wa howling he would never had such a bad day in his life he wa hungry he would missed five television program he would wanted to see and he would never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer uncle vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy looking hotel on the outskirt of a big city dudley and harry shared a room with twin bed and damp musty sheet dudley snored but harry stayed awake sitting on the windowsill staring down at the light of passing car and wondering they ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomato on toast for breakfast the next day they had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table scuse me but is one of you mr h potter only i got about an undred of these at the front desk she held up a letter so they could read the green ink address mr h potter room railview hotel cokeworth harry made a grab for the letter but uncle vernon knocked his hand out of the way the woman stared ill take them said uncle vernon standing up quickly and following her from the dining room k k k page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling would not it be better just to go home dear aunt petunia suggested timidly hour later but uncle vernon did not seem to hear her exactly what he wa looking for none of them knew he drove them into the middle of a forest got out looked around shook his head got back in the car and off they went again the same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field halfway across a suspension bridge and at the top of a multilevel parking garage daddy gone mad ha not he dudley asked aunt petunia dully late that afternoon uncle vernon had parked at the coast locked them all inside the car and disappeared it started to rain great drop beat on the roof of the car dudley sniveled it monday he told his mother the great humbertos on tonight i want to stay somewhere with a television monday this reminded harry of something if it wa monday and you could usually count on dudley to know the day of the week because of television then tomorrow tuesday wa harrys eleventh birthday of course his birthday were never exactly fun last year the dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of uncle vernons old sock still you were not eleven every day uncle vernon wa back and he wa smiling he wa also carrying a long thin package and did not answer aunt petunia when she asked what he would bought found the perfect place he said come on everyone out page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling it wa very cold outside the car uncle vernon wa pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea perched on top of the rock wa the most miserable little shack you could imagine one thing wa certain there wa no television in there storm forecast for tonight said uncle vernon gleefully clapping his hand together and this gentleman kindly agreed to lend u his boat a toothless old man came ambling up to them pointing with a rather wicked grin at an old rowboat bobbing in the irongray water below them i have already got u some ration said uncle vernon so all aboard it wa freezing in the boat icy sea spray and rain crept down their neck and a chilly wind whipped their face after what seemed like hour they reached the rock where uncle vernon slipping and sliding led the way to the brokendown house the inside wa horrible it smelled strongly of seaweed the wind whistled through the gap in the wooden wall and the fireplace wa damp and empty there were only two room uncle vernons ration turned out to be a bag of chip each and four banana he tried to start a fire but the empty chip bag just smoked and shriveled up could do with some of those letter now eh he said cheerfully he wa in a very good mood obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail harry privately agreed though the thought did not cheer him up at all page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling a night fell the promised storm blew up around them spray from the high wave splattered the wall of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the filthy window aunt petunia found a few moldy blanket in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry wa left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket the storm raged more and more ferociously a the night went on harry could not sleep he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger dudleys snore were drowned by the low roll of thunder that started near midnight the lighted dial of dudleys watch which wa dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry he would be eleven in ten minute time he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer wa now five minute to go harry heard something creak outside he hoped the roof wa not going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did four minute to go maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letter when they got back that he would be able to steal one somehow three minute to go wa that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that and two minute to go what wa that funny crunching noise wa the rock crumbling into the sea one minute to go and he would be eleven thirty second twenty ten nine maybe he would wake dudley up just to annoy him three two one boom page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the whole shack shivered and harry sat bolt upright staring at the door someone wa outside knocking to come in page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the keeper of the key boom they knocked again dudley jerked awake where is the cannon he said stupidly there wa a crash behind them and uncle vernon came skidding into the room he wa holding a rifle in his hand now they knew what had been in the long thin package he had brought with them who is there he shouted i warn you i am armed there wa a pause then smash the door wa hit with such force that it swung clean off it hinge and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor a giant of a man wa standing in the doorway his face wa almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling make out his eye glinting like black beetle under all the hair the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into it frame the noise of the storm outside dropped a little he turned to look at them all could not make u a cup o tea could yeh it not been an easy journey he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear budge up yeh great lump said the stranger dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who wa crouching terrified behind uncle vernon an here is harry said the giant harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eye were crinkled in a smile la time i saw you you wa only a baby said the giant yeh look a lot like yer dad but yehve got yer mom eye uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise i demand that you leave at once sir he said you are breaking and entering ah shut up dursley yeh great prune said the giant he reached over the back of the sofa jerked the gun out of uncle vernons hand bent it into a knot a easily a if it had been made of rubber and threw it into a corner of the room page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling uncle vernon made another funny noise like a mouse being trodden on anyway harry said the giant turning his back on the dursleys a very happy birthday to yeh got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but it will taste all right from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box harry opened it with trembling finger inside wa a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing harry looked up at the giant he meant to say thank you but the word got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead wa who are you the giant chuckled true i have not introduced meself rubeus hagrid keeper of key and ground at hogwarts he held out an enormous hand and shook harrys whole arm what about that tea then eh he said rubbing his hand together id not say no ter summat stronger if yehve got it mind his eye fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bag in it and he snorted he bent down over the fireplace they could not see what he wa doing but when he drew back a second later there wa a roaring fire there it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him a though he would sunk into a hot bath page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sort of thing out of the pocket of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausage a poker a teapot several chipped mug and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea soon the hut wa full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage nobody said a thing while the giant wa working but a he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausage from the poker dudley fidgeted a little uncle vernon said sharply do not touch anything he give you dudley the giant chuckled darkly yer great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worry he passed the sausage to harry who wa so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still could not take his eye off the giant finally a nobody seemed about to explain anything he said i am sorry but i still do not really know who you are the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand call me hagrid he said everyone doe an like i told yeh i am keeper of key at hogwarts yehll know all about hogwarts o course er no said harry hagrid looked shocked sorry harry said quickly sorry barked hagrid turning to stare at the dursleys who shrank back into the shadow it

never wonder where yer parent learned it all all what asked harry all what hagrid thundered now wait jus one second he had leapt to his foot in his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut the dursleys

after all and his mark were not bad i know some thing he said i can you know do math and stuff but hagrid simply waved his hand and said about our world i mean your world my world yer parent world

told him never told him what wa in the letter dumbledore left fer him i wa there i saw dumbledore leave it dursley an you have kept it from him all these year kept what from me said harry eagerly stop

dumbledore given harry his letter taking him to buy his thing tomorrow weather horrible hope you are well hagrid hagrid rolled up the note gave it to the owl which clamped it in it beak went to the

school and they left and got married and had you and of course i knew you would be just the same just a strange just a a abnormal and then if you please she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry had gone very white a soon a he found his voice he said blown up you told me they died in a car crash car crash roared hagrid jumping up so angrily that the dursleys scuttled back to their corner how could a car crash kill lily an james potter it an outrage a scandal harry potter not knowin his own story when every kid in our world know his name but why what happened harry asked urgently the anger faded from hagrids face he looked suddenly anxious i never expected this he said in a low worried voice i had no idea when dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin hold of yeh how much yeh did not know ah harry i don know if i am the right person ter tell yeh but someone is got to yeh can not go off ter hogwarts not knowin he threw a dirty look at the dursleys well it best yeh know a much a i can tell yeh mind i can not tell yeh everythin it a great mystry part of it he sat down stared into the fire for a few second and then said it begin i suppose with with a person called but it incredible yeh do not know his name everyone in our world know who well i don like sayin the name if i can help it no one doe why not page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling gulpin gargoyle harry people are still scared blimey this is difficult see there wa this wizard who went bad a bad a you could go worse worse than worse his name wa hagrid gulped but no word came out could you write it down harry suggested nah can not spell it all right voldemort hagrid shuddered don make me say it again anyway this this wizard about twenty year ago now started lookin fer follower got them too some were afraid some just wanted a bit o his power because he wa gettin himself power all right dark day harry did not know who ter trust did not dare get friendly with strange wizard or witch terrible thing happened he wa takin over course some stood up to him an he killed them horribly one o the only safe place left wa hogwarts reckon dumbledores the only one youknowwho wa afraid of did not dare try takin the school not jus then anyway now yer mum an dad were a good a witch an wizard a i ever knew head boy an girl at hogwarts in their day suppose the mystry is why youknow who never tried to get them on his side before probably knew they were too close ter dumbledore ter want anythin ter do with the dark side maybe he thought he could persuade them maybe he just wanted them outta the way all anyone know is he turned up in the village where you wa all living on halloween ten year ago you wa just a year old he came ter yer house an an hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling sorry he said but it that sad knew yer mum an dad an nicer people yeh could not find anyway youknowwho killed them an then an this is the real mystry of the thing he tried to kill you too wanted ter make a clean job of it i suppose or maybe he just liked killin by then but he could not do it never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead that wa no ordinary cut that is what yeh get when a powerful evil curse touch yeh took care of yer mum an dad an yer house even but it did not work on you an that is why yer famous harry no one ever lived after he decided ter kill them no one except you an he would killed some o the best witch an wizard of the age the mckinnons the bone the prewetts an you wa only a baby an you lived something very painful wa going on in harrys mind a hagrids story came to a close he saw again the blinding flash of green light more clearly than he had ever remembered it before and he remembered something else for the first time in his life a high cold cruel laugh hagrid wa watching him sadly took yeh from the ruined house myself on dumbledores order brought yeh ter this lot load of old tosh said uncle vernon harry jumped he had almost forgotten that the dursleys were there uncle vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage he wa glaring at hagrid and his fist were clenched now you listen here boy he snarled i accept there is something strange about you probably page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling nothing a good beating would not have cured and a for all this about your parent well they were weirdo no denying it and the world better off without them in my opinion asked for all they got getting mixed up with these wizarding type just what i expected always knew they would come to a sticky end but at that moment hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat pointing this at uncle vernon like a sword he said i am warning you dursley i am warning you one more word in danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a bearded giant uncle vernons courage failed again he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent that is better said hagrid breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa which this time sagged right down to the floor harry meanwhile still had question to ask hundred of them but what happened to vol sorry i mean you knowwho good question harry disappeared vanished same night he tried ter kill you make yeh even more famous that is the biggest mystry see he wa gettin more an more powerful why did he go some say he died codswallop in my opinion do not know if he had enough human left in him to die some say he still out there bidin his time like but i don believe it people who wa on his side came back ter page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling ours some of them came outta kind of trance don reckon they could have done if he wa cornin back most of u reckon he still out there somewhere but lost his power too weak to carry on because somethin about you finished him harry there wa somethin goin on that night he had not counted on do not know what it wa no one doe but somethin about you stumped him all right hagrid looked at harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eye but harry instead of feeling pleased and proud felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake a wizard him how could he possibly be he would spent his life being clouted by dudley and bullied by aunt petunia and uncle vernon if he wa really a wizard why had not they been turned into warty toad every time they would tried to lock him in his cupboard if he would once defeated the greatest sorcerer in the world how come dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football hagrid he said quietly i think you must have made a mistake i do not think i can be a wizard to his surprise hagrid chuckled not a wizard eh never made thing happen when you wa scared or angry harry looked into the fire now he came to think about it every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious with him had happened when he harry had been upset or angry chased by dudleys gang he had somehow found himself out of their reach dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut he would managed to make it grow back and the very last time dudley had hit him page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling had not he got his revenge without even realizing he wa doing it had not he set a boa constrictor on him harry looked back at hagrid smiling and saw that hagrid wa positively beaming at him see said hagrid harry potter not a wizard you wait you will be right famous at hogwarts but uncle vernon wa not going to give in without a fight have not i told you he not going he hissed he going to stonewall high and hell be grateful for it i have read those letter and he need all sort of rubbish spell book and wand and if he want ter go a great muggle like you will not stop him growled hagrid stop lily an james potter son goin ter hogwarts yer mad his name been down ever since he wa born he off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world seven year there and he will not know himself hell be with youngster of his own sort fer a change an hell be under the greatest headmaster hogwarts ever had albus dumbled i am not paying for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic trick yelled uncle vernon but he had finally gone too far hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head never he thundered insult albus dumbledore in front of me he brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at dudley there wa a flash of violet light a sound like a firecracker a sharp squeal and page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the next second dudley wa dancing on the spot with his hand clasped over his fat bottom howling in pain when he turned his back on them harry saw a curly pig tail poking through a hole in his trouser uncle vernon roared pulling aunt petunia and dudley into the other room he cast one last terrified look at hagrid and slammed the door behind them hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard shouldnta lost me temper he said ruefully but it did not work anyway meant ter turn him into a pig but i suppose he wa so much like a pig anyway there wa not much left ter do he cast a sideways look at harry under his bushy eyebrow be grateful if yeh did not mention that ter anyone at hogwarts he said i am er not supposed ter do magic strictly speakin i wa allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an get yer letter to yeh an stuff one o the reason i wa so keen ter take on the job why are not you supposed to do magic asked harry oh well i wa at hogwarts meself but i er got expelled ter tell yeh the truth in me

said don mind if it wriggle a bit i think i still got a couple o dormouse in one o the pocket page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling diagon ally harry woke early the next morning although he could tell it wa daylight he kept his eye shut tight it wa a dream he told himself firmly i dreamed a giant called hagrid came to tell me i wa going to a school for wizard when i open my eye ill be at home in my cupboard there wa suddenly a loud tapping noise and there is aunt petunia knocking on the door harry thought his heart sinking but he still did not open his eye it had been such a good dream tap tap tap all right harry mumbled i am getting up he sat up and hagrid s heavy coat fell off him the hut wa full of sunlight the storm wa over hagrid himself wa asleep on the collapsed sofa and there page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling wa an owl rapping it claw on the window a newspaper held in it beak harry scrambled to his foot so happy he felt a though a large balloon wa swelling inside him he went straight to the window and jerked it open the owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of hagrid who did not wake up the owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack hagrid s coat do not do that harry tried to wave the owl out of the way but it snapped it beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat hagrid said harry loudly there is an owl pay him hagrid grunted into the sofa what he want payin fer deliverin the paper look in the pocket hagrid s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pocket bunch of key slug pellet ball of string peppermint humbug teabags finally harry pulled out a handful of strangelooking coin give him five knut said hagrid sleepily knut the little bronze one harry counted out five little bronze coin and the owl held out his leg so harry could put the money into a page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling small leather pouch tied to it then he flew off through the open window hagrid yawned loudly sat up and stretched best be off harry lot ter do today got to get up ter london an buy all yer stuff fer school harry wa turning over the wizard coin and looking at them he had just thought of something that made him feel a though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture urn hagrid mm said hagrid who wa pulling on his huge boot i have not got any money and you heard uncle vernon last night he will not pay for me to go and learn magic do not worry about that said hagrid standing up and scratching his head dyeh think yer parent did not leave yeh anything but if their house wa destroyed they didn keep their gold in the house boy nah first stop fer u is gringotts wizard bank have a sausage they are not bad cold an i wouldn say no teh a bit o yer birthday

gringotts anyway fer dumbledore hogwarts business hagrid drew himself up proudly he usually get me ter do important stuff fer him fetchin you gettin thing from gringotts know he can trust me see got everythin come on then harry followed hagrid out onto the rock the sky wa quite clear now and the sea gleamed in the sunlight the boat uncle vernon had hired wa still there with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm how did you get here harry asked looking around for another boat flew said hagrid flew yeah but well go back in this not spposed ter use magic now i have got yeh they settled down in the boat harry still staring at hagrid trying to imagine him flying seems a shame ter row though said hagrid giving harry another of his sideways look if i wa ter er speed thing up a bit would yeh mind not mentionin it at hogwarts of course not said harry eager to see more magic hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again tapped it page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling twice on the side of the boat and they sped off toward land why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts harry asked spell enchantment said hagrid unfolding his newspaper a he spoke they say there is dragon guardin the highsecurity vault and then yeh got to find yer way gringotts is hundred of mile under london see deep under the underground yehd die of hunger tryin ter get out even if yeh did manage ter get yer hand on summat harry sat and thought about this while hagrid read his newspaper the daily prophet harry had learned from uncle vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this but it wa very difficult he would never had so many question in his life ministry o magic messin thing up a usual hagrid muttered turning the page there is a ministry of magic harry asked before he could stop himself course said hagrid they wanted dumbledore fer minister o course but he would never leave hogwarts so old cornelius fudge got the job bungler if ever there wa one so he pelt dumbledore with owl every morning askin fer advice but what doe a ministry of magic do well their main job is to keep it from the muggles that there is still witch an wizard up an down the country why page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling why blimey harry everyone d be wantin magic solution to their problem nah were best left alone at this moment the boat bumped gently into the harbor wall hagrid folded up his newspaper and they clambered up the stone step onto the street passersby stared a lot at hagrid a they walked through the little town to the station harry could not blame them not only wa hagrid twice a tall a anyone else he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary thing like parking meter and saying loudly see that harry thing these muggles dream up eh hagrid said harry panting a bit a he ran to keep up did you say there are dragon at gringotts well so they say said hagrid crikey id like a dragon you would like one wanted one ever since i wa a kid here we go they had reached the station there wa a train to london in five minute time hagrid who did not understand muggle money a he called it gave the bill to harry so he could buy their ticket people stared more than ever on the train hagrid took up two seat and sat knitting what looked like a canaryyellow circus tent still got yer letter harry he asked a he counted stitch harry took the parchment envelope out of his pocket page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling good said hagrid there is a list there of everything yeh need harry unfolded a second piece of paper he had

been to london before although hagrid seemed to know where he wa going he wa obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way he got stuck in the ticket barrier on the underground and complained loudly that the seat were too small and the train too slow page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i do not know how the muggles manage without magic he said a they climbed a brokendown escalator that led up to a bustling road lined with shop hagrid wa so huge that he parted the crowd easily all harry had to do wa keep close behind him they passed book shop and music store hamburger restaurant and cinema but nowhere that looked a if it could sell you a magic wand this wa just an ordinary street full of ordinary people could there really be pile of wizard gold buried mile beneath them were there really shop that sold spell book and broomstick might this not all be some huge joke that the dursleys had cooked up if harry had not known that the dursleys had no sense of humor he might have thought so yet somehow even though everything hagrid had told him so far wa unbelievable harry could not help trusting him this is it said hagrid coming to a halt the leaky cauldron it a famous place it wa a tiny grubbylooking pub if hagrid had not pointed it out harry would not have noticed it wa there the people hurrying by did not glance at it their eye slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other a if they could not see the leaky cauldron at all in fact harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and hagrid could see it before he could mention this hagrid had steered him inside for a famous place it wa very dark and shabby a few old woman were sitting in a corner drinking tiny glass of sherry one of them wa smoking a long pipe a little man in a top hat wa talking to the old bartender who wa quite bald and looked like a toothless walnut the low buzz of chatter stopped page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling when they walked in everyone seemed to know hagrid they waved and smiled at him and the bartender reached for a glass saying the usual hagrid can not tom i am on hogwarts business said hagrid clapping his great hand on harrys shoulder and making harrys knee buckle good lord said the bartender peering at harry is this can this be the leaky cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent bless my soul whispered the old bartender harry potter what an honor he hurried out from behind the bar rushed toward harry and seized his hand tear in his eye welcome back mr potter welcome back harry did not know what to say everyone wa looking at him the old woman with the pipe wa puffing on it without realizing it had gone out hagrid wa beaming then there wa a great scraping of chair and the next moment harry found himself shaking hand with everyone in the leaky cauldron doris crockford mr potter can not believe i am meeting you at last so proud mr potter i am just so proud always wanted to shake your hand i am all of a flutter page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling delighted mr potter just can not tell you diggles the name dedalus diggle i have seen you before said harry a dedalus diggles top hat fell off in his excitement you bowed to me once in a shop he remembers cried dedalus diggle looking around at everyone did you hear that he remembers me harry shook hand again and again doris crockford kept coming back for more a pale young man made his way forward very nervously one of his eye wa twitching professor quirrell said hagrid harry professor quirrell will be one of your teacher at hogwarts pppotter stammered professor quirrell grasping harrys hand ccant ttell you how ppleased i am to meet you what sort of magic do you teach professor quirrell ddefense against the dddark art muttered professor quirrell a though he would rather not think about it nnot that you nneed it eh pppotter he laughed nervously you will be ggetting all your equipment i suppose i have ggot to ppick up a new b book on vampire mmyself he looked terrified at the very thought but the others would not let professor quirrell keep harry to himself it took almost ten minute to get away from them all at last hagrid managed to make himself heard over the babble page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling must get on lot ter buy come on harry doris crockford shook harrys hand one last time and hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small walled courtyard where there wa nothing but a trash can and a few weed hagrid grinned at harry told yeh did not i told yeh you wa famous even professor quirrell wa tremblin ter meet yeh mind you he usually tremblin is he always that nervous oh yeah poor bloke brilliant mind he wa fine while he wa studyin outta book but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience they say he met vampire in the black forest and there wa a nasty bit o trouble with a hag never been the same since scared of the student scared of his own subject now where is me umbrella vampire hag harrys head wa swimming hagrid meanwhile wa counting brick in the wall above the trash can three up two across he muttered right stand back harry he tapped the wall three time with the point of his umbrella the brick he had touched quivered it wriggled in the middle a small hole appeared it grew wider and wider a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for hagrid an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling welcome said hagrid to diagon alley he grinned at harrys amazement they stepped through the archway harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall the sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldron outside the nearest shop cauldron all size copper brass pewter silver selfstirring collapsible said a sign hanging over them yeah you will be needin one said hagrid but we got to get yer money first harry wished he had about eight more eye he turned his head in every direction a they walked up the street trying to look at everything at once the shop the thing outside them the people doing their shopping a plump woman outside an apothecary wa shaking her head a they passed saying dragon liver sixteen sickle an ounce they are mad a low soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying eeylops owl emporium tawny screech barn brown and snowy several boy of about harrys age had their nose pressed against a window with broomstick in it look harry heard one of them say the new nimbus two thousand fastest ever there were shop selling robe shop selling telescope and strange silver instrument harry had never seen before window stacked with barrel of bat spleen and eel eye tottering pile of spell book quill and roll of parchment potion bottle globe of the moon gringotts said hagrid page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling they had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shop standing beside it burnished bronze door wearing a uniform of scarlet and gold wa yeah that is a goblin said hagrid quietly a they walked up the white stone step toward him the goblin wa about a head shorter than harry he had a swarthy clever face a pointed beard and harry noticed very long finger and foot he bowed a they walked inside now they were facing a second pair of door silver this time with word engraved upon them enter stranger but take heed of what awaits the sin of greed for those who take but do not earn must pay most dearly in their turn so if you seek beneath our floor a treasure that wa never yours thief you have been warned beware of finding more than treasure there like i said yehd be mad ter try an rob it said hagrid a pair of goblin bowed them through the silver door and they were in a vast marble hall about a hundred more goblin were sitting on high stool behind a long counter scribbling in large ledger weighing coin in brass scale examining precious stone through eyeglass there were too many door to count page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling leading off the hall and yet more goblin were showing people in and out of these hagrid and harry made for the counter morning said hagrid to a free goblin we have come ter take some money outta mr harry potter safe you have his key sir got it here somewhere said hagrid and he started emptying his pocket onto the counter scattering a handful of moldy dog biscuit over the goblin book of number the goblin wrinkled his nose harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of ruby a big a glowing coal got it said hagrid at last holding up a tiny golden key the goblin looked at it closely that seems to be in order an i have also got a letter here from professor dumbledore said hagrid importantly throwing out his chest it about the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen the goblin read the letter carefully very well he said handing it back to hagrid i will have someone take you down to both vault griphook griphook wa yet another goblin once hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuit back inside his pocket he and harry followed griphook toward one of the door leading off the hall page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling what is the youknowwhat in vault seven hundred and thirteen harry asked can not tell yeh that said hagrid mysteriously very secret hogwarts business dumbledores trusted me moren my job worth ter tell yeh that griphook held the door open for them harry who had expected more marble wa surprised they were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torch it sloped steeply downward and there were little railway track on the floor griphook whistled and a small cart came hurtling up the track toward them they climbed in hagrid with some difficulty and were off at first they just hurtled through a maze of twisting passage harry tried to remember left right right left middle fork right left but it wa impossible the rattling cart seemed to know it own way because griphook wa not steering harrys eye stung a the cold air rushed past them but he kept them wide open once he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it wa a dragon but too late they plunged even deeper passing an underground lake where huge stalactite and stalagmite grew from the ceiling and floor i never know harry called to hagrid over the noise of the cart what is the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite stalagmite got an m in it said hagrid an don ask me question just now i think i am going to be sick page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he did look very green and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knee from trembling griphook unlocked the door a lot of green smoke came billowing out and a it cleared harry gasped inside were mound of gold coin column of silver heap of little bronze knut all yours smiled hagrid all harrys it wa incredible the dursleys could not have known about this or they would have had it from him faster than blinking how often had they complained how much harry cost them to keep and all the time there had been a small fortune belonging to him buried deep under london hagrid helped harry pile some of it into a bag the gold one are galleon he explained seventeen silver sickle to a galleon and twentynine knut to a sickle it easy enough right that should be enough fer a couple o term well keep the rest safe for yeh he turned to griphook vault seven hundred and thirteen now please and can we go more slowly one speed only said griphook they were going even deeper now and gathering speed the air became colder and colder a they hurtled round tight corner they went rattling over an underground ravine and harry leaned over the side to try to see what wa down at the dark bottom but hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole stand back said griphook importantly he stroked the door gently with one of his long finger and it simply melted away if anyone but a gringotts goblin tried that they would be sucked through the door and trapped in there said griphook how often do you check to see if anyones inside harry asked about once every ten year said griphook with a rather nasty grin something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault harry wa sure and he leaned forward eagerly expecting to see fabulous jewel at the very least but at first he thought it wa empty then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat harry longed to know what it wa but knew better than to ask come on back in this infernal cart and do not talk to me on the way back it best if i keep me mouth shut said hagrid one wild cart ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside gringotts harry did not know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money he did not have to know how many galleon there were to a pound to know that he wa holding more money than he would had in his whole life more money than even dudley had ever had page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling might a well get yer uniform said hagrid nodding toward madam malkins robe for all occasion listen harry would yeh mind if i slipped off fer a pickmeup in the leaky cauldron i hate them gringotts cart he did still look a bit sick so harry entered madam malkins shop alone feeling nervous madam malkin wa a squat smiling witch dressed all in mauve hogwarts dear she said when harry started to speak got the lot here another young man being fitted up just now in fact in the back of the shop a boy with a pale pointed face wa standing on a footstool while a second witch pinned up his long black robe madam malkin stood harry on a stool next to him slipped a long robe over his head and began to pin it to the right length hello said the boy hogwarts too yes said harry my father next door buying my book and mother up the street looking at wand said the boy he had a bored drawling voice then i am going to drag them off to look at racing broom i do not see why first year can not have their own i think ill bully father into getting me one and ill smuggle it in somehow harry wa strongly reminded of dudley have you got your own broom the boy went on no said harry play quidditch at all page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling no harry said again wondering what on earth quidditch could be i do father say it a crime if i am not picked to play for my house and i must say i agree know what house you be in yet no said harry feeling more stupid by the minute well no one really know until they get there do they but i know ill be in slytherin all our family have been imagine being in hufflepuff i think id leave would not you mmm said harry wishing he could say something a bit more interesting i say look at that man said the boy suddenly nodding toward the front window hagrid wa standing there grinning at harry and pointing at two large ice cream to show he could not come in that is hagrid said harry pleased to know something the boy did not he work at hogwarts oh said the boy i have heard of him he a sort of servant is not he he the gamekeeper said harry he wa liking the boy le and le every second yes exactly i heard he a sort of savage life in a hut on the school ground and every now and then he get drunk try to do magic and end up setting fire to his bed i think he brilliant said harry coldly page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling do you said the boy with a slight sneer why is he with you where are your parent they are dead said harry shortly he did not feel much like going into the matter with this boy oh sorry said the other not sounding sorry at all but they were our kind were not they they were a witch and wizard if that is what you mean i really do not think they should let the other sort in do you they are just not the same they have never been brought up to know our way some of them have never even heard of hogwarts until they get the letter imagine i think they should keep it in the old wizarding family what is your surname anyway but before harry could answer madam malkin said that is you done my dear and harry not sorry for an excuse to stop talking to the boy hopped down from the footstool well ill see you at hogwarts i suppose said the drawling boy harry wa rather quiet a he ate the ice cream hagrid had bought him chocolate and raspberry with chopped nut what is up said hagrid nothing harry lied they stopped to buy parchment and quill harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color a you wrote when they had left the shop he said hagrid what is quidditch page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling blimey harry i keep forgettin how little yeh know not knowin about quidditch do not make me feel worse said harry he told hagrid about the pale boy in madam malkins and he said people from muggle family should not even be allowed in yer not from a muggle family if he would known who yeh were he grown up knowin yer name

the ceiling with book a large a paving stone bound in leather book the size of postage stamp in cover of silk book full of peculiar symbol and a few book with nothing in them at all even dudley who never read anything would have been wild to get his hand on some of these hagrid almost had to drag harry away from curse and countercurses bewitch your friend and befuddle your enemy with the latest

in the muggle world except in very special circumstance said hagrid an anyway yeh couldn work any of them curse yet yehll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level hagrid would not let harry buy a solid gold cauldron either it say pewter on yer list but they got a nice set of scale for weighing potion ingredient and a collapsible brass telescope then they visited the apothecary which wa fascinating enough to make up for it horrible smell a mixture of bad egg and rotted cabbage barrel of slimy stuff stood on the floor jar of herb dried root and bright powder lined the wall bundle of feather string of fang and snarled claw hung from the ceiling while hagrid asked the man behind the counter for a supply of some basic potion ingredient for harry harry himself examined silver unicorn horn at twentyone galleon each and minuscule glittery black beetle eye five knut a scoop page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling outside the apothecary hagrid checked harrys list again just yer wand left oh yeah an i still have not got yeh a birthday present harry felt himself go red you do not have to i know i do not have to tell yeh what ill get yer animal not a toad toad went outta fashion year ago yehd be laughed at an i don like cat they make me sneeze ill get yer an owl all the kid want owl they are dead useful carry yer mail an everythin twenty minute later they left eeylops owl emporium which had been dark and full of rustling and flickering jewelbright eye harry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl fast asleep with her head under her wing he could not stop stammering his thanks sounding just like professor quirrell don mention it said hagrid gruffly don expect you have had a lotta present from them dursleys just ollivanders left now only place fer wand ollivanders and yeh got to have the best wand a magic wand this wa what harry had been really looking forward to the last shop wa narrow and shabby peeling gold letter over the door read ollivanders maker of fine wand since b c a single wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling a tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depth of the shop a they stepped inside it wa a tiny place empty except for a single spindly chair that hagrid sat on to wait harry felt strangely a though he had entered a very strict library he swallowed a lot of new question that had just occurred to him and looked instead at the thousand of narrow box piled neatly right up to the ceiling for some reason the back of his neck prickled the very dust and silence in here seemed to tingle with some secret magic good afternoon said a soft voice harry jumped hagrid must have jumped too because there wa a loud crunching noise and he got quickly off the spindly chair an old man wa standing before them his wide pale eye shining like moon through the gloom of the shop hello said harry awkwardly ah yes said the man yes yes i thought id be seeing you soon harry potter it wa not a question you have your mother eye it seems only yesterday she wa in here herself buying her first wand ten and a quarter inch long swishy made of willow nice wand for charm work mr ollivander moved closer to harry harry wished he would blink those silvery eye were a bit creepy your father on the other hand favored a mahogany wand eleven inch pliable a little more power and excellent for transfiguration well i say your father favored it it really the wand that chooses the wizard of course page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling mr ollivander had come so close that he and harry were almost nose to nose harry could see himself reflected in those misty eye and that is where mr ollivander touched the lightning scar on harrys forehead with a long white finger i am sorry to say i sold the wand that did it he said softly thirteenandahalf inch yew powerful wand very powerful and in the wrong hand well if id known what that wand wa going out into the world to do he shook his head and then to harrys relief spotted hagrid rubeus rubeus hagrid how nice to see you again oak sixteen inch rather bendy wa not it it wa sir yes said hagrid good wand that one but i suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled said mr ollivander suddenly stern er yes they did yes said hagrid shuffling his foot i have still got the piece though he added brightly but you do not use them said mr ollivander sharply oh no sir said hagrid quickly harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly a he spoke hmmm said mr ollivander giving hagrid a piercing look well now mr potter let me see page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he pulled a long tape measure with silver marking out of his pocket which is your wand arm er well i am righthanded said harry hold out your arm that is it he measured harry from shoulder to finger then wrist to elbow shoulder to floor knee to armpit and round his head a he measured he said every ollivander wand ha a core of a powerful magical substance mr potter we use unicorn hair phoenix tail feather and the heartstrings of dragon no two ollivander wand are the same just a no two unicorn dragon or phoenix are quite the same and of course you will never get such good result with another wizard wand harry suddenly realized that the tape measure which wa measuring between his nostril wa doing this on it own mr ollivander wa flitting around the shelf taking down box that will do he said and the tape measure crumpled into a heap on the floor right then mr potter try this one beechwood and dragon heartstring nine inch nice and flexible just take it and give it a wave harry took the wand and feeling foolish waved it around a bit but mr ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once maple and phoenix feather seven inch quite whippy try harry tried but he had hardly raised the wand when it too wa snatched back by mr ollivander page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling no no here ebony and unicorn hair eight and a half inch springy go on go on try it out harry tried and tried he had no idea what mr ollivander wa waiting for the pile of tried wand wa mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair but the more wand mr ollivander pulled from the shelf the happier he seemed to become tricky customer eh not to worry well find the perfect match here somewhere i wonder now yes why not unusual combination holly and phoenix feather eleven inch nice and supple harry took the wand he felt a sudden warmth in his finger he raised the wand above his head brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold spark shot from the end like a firework throwing dancing spot of light on to the wall hagrid whooped and clapped and mr ollivander cried oh bravo yes indeed oh very good well well well how curious how very curious he put harrys wand back into it box and wrapped it in brown paper still muttering curious curious sorry said harry but what is curious mr ollivander fixed harry with his pale stare i remember every wand i have ever sold mr potter every single wand it so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand gave another feather just one other it is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when it brother why it brother gave you that scar harry swallowed page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling yes thirteenandahalf inch yew curious indeed how these thing happen the wand chooses the wizard remember i think we must expect great thing from you mr potter after all hewho mustnotbenamed did great thing terrible yes but great harry shivered he wa not sure he liked mr ollivander too much he paid seven gold galleon for his wand and mr ollivander bowed them from his shop the late afternoon sun hung low in the sky a harry and hagrid made their way back down diagon alley back through the wall back through the leaky cauldron now empty harry did not speak at all a they walked down the road he did not even notice how much people were gawking at them on the underground laden a they were with all their funny shaped package with the snowy owl asleep in it cage on harrys lap up another escalator out into paddington station harry only realized where they were when hagrid tapped him on the shoulder got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaf he said he bought harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seat to eat them harry kept looking around everything looked so strange somehow you all right harry yer very quiet said hagrid harry wa not sure he could explain he would just had the best birthday of his life and yet he chewed his hamburger trying to find the word everyone think i am special he said at last all those people in the leaky cauldron professor page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling quirrell mr ollivander but i do not know anything about magic at all how can they expect great thing i am famous and i can not even remember what i am famous for i do not know what happened when vol sorry i mean the night my parent died hagrid leaned across the table behind the wild beard and eyebrow he wore a very kind smile don you worry harry you will learn fast enough everyone start at the beginning at hogwarts you will be just fine just be yerself i know it hard yehve been singled out an that is always hard but yehll have a great time at hogwarts i did still do smatter of fact hagrid helped harry on to the train that would take him back to the dursleys then handed him an envelope yer ticket fer hogwarts he said first o september king cross it all on yer ticket any problem with the dursleys send me a letter with yer owl she will know where to find me see yeh soon harry the train pulled out of the station harry wanted to watch hagrid until he wa out of sight he rose in his seat and pressed his nose against the window but he blinked and hagrid had gone page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the journey from platform nine and threequarters harrys last month with the dursleys wa not fun true dudley wa now so scared of harry he would not stay in the same room while aunt petunia and uncle vernon did not shut harry in his cupboard force him to do anything or shout at him in fact they did not speak to him at all half terrified half furious they acted a though any chair with harry in it were empty although this wa an improvement in many way it did become a bit depressing after a while harry kept to his room with his new owl for company he had decided to call her hedwig a name he had found in a history of magic his school book were very interesting he lay on his bed reading late into the night hedwig swooping in and out of the open window a she pleased it wa lucky that aunt petunia did not come in to vacuum anymore because hedwig kept bringing back dead mouse every night before he went to sleep harry ticked off another day page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall counting down to september the first on the last day of august he thought he would better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to king cross station the next day so he went down to the living room where they were watching a quiz show on television he cleared his throat to let them know he wa there and dudley screamed and ran from the room er uncle vernon uncle vernon grunted to show he wa listening er i need to be at king cross tomorrow to to go to hogwarts uncle vernon grunted again would it be all right if you gave me a lift grunt harry supposed that meant yes thank you he wa about to go back upstairs when uncle vernon actually spoke funny way to get to a wizard school the train magic carpet all got puncture have they harry did not say anything where is this school anyway i do not know said harry realizing this for the first time he pulled the ticket hagrid had given him out of his pocket page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i just take the train from platform nine and three quarter at eleven of the clock he read his aunt and uncle stared platform what nine and threequarters do not talk rubbish said uncle vernon there is no platform nine and threequarters it on my ticket barking said uncle vernon howling mad the lot of them you see you just wait all right well take you to king cross were going up to london tomorrow anyway or i would not bother why are you going to london harry asked trying to keep thing friendly taking dudley to the hospital growled uncle vernon got to have that ruddy tail removed before he go to smeltings harry woke at five of the clock the next morning and wa too excited and nervous to go back to sleep he got up and pulled on his jean because he did not want to walk into the station in his wizard robe he would change on the train he checked his hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed saw that hedwig wa shut safely in her cage and then paced the room waiting for the dursleys to get up two hour later harrys huge heavy trunk had been loaded into the dursleys car aunt petunia had talked dudley into sitting next to harry and they had set off page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling they reached king cross at half past ten uncle vernon dumped harrys trunk onto a cart and wheeled it into the station for him harry thought this wa strangely kind until uncle vernon stopped dead facing the platform with a nasty grin on his face well there you are boy platform nine platform ten your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they do not seem to have built it yet do they he wa quite right of course there wa a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it and in the middle nothing at all have a good term said uncle vernon with an even nastier smile he left without another word harry turned and saw the dursleys drive away all three of them were laughing harrys mouth went rather dry what on earth wa he going to do he wa starting to attract a lot of funny look because of hedwig he would have to ask someone he stopped a passing guard but did not dare mention platform nine and threequarters the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry could not even tell him what part of the country it wa in he started to get annoyed a though harry wa being stupid on purpose getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven of the clock but the guard said there wa not one in the end the guard strode away muttering about time waster harry wa now trying hard not to panic according to the large clock over the arrival board he had ten minute left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he wa stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector stand between platform nine and ten at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few word of what they were saying packed with muggles of course harry swung round the speaker wa a plump woman who wa talking to four boy all with flaming red hair each of them wa pushing a trunk like harrys in front of him and they had an owl heart hammering harry pushed his cart after them they stopped and so did he just near enough to hear what they were saying now what is the platform number said the boy mother nine and threequarters piped a small girl also red headed who wa holding her hand mom can not i go you are not old enough ginny now be quiet all right percy you go first what looked like the oldest boy marched toward platform nine and ten harry watched careful not to blink in case he missed it but just a the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platform a large crowd of tourist came swarming in front of him and by the time the last backpack had cleared away the boy had vanished page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling fred you next the plump woman said i am not fred i am george said the boy honestly woman you call yourself our mother can not you tell i am george sorry george dear only joking i am fred said the boy and off he went his twin called after him to hurry up and he must have done so because a second later he had gone but how had he done it now the third brother wa walking briskly toward the barrier he wa almost there and then quite suddenly he wa not anywhere there wa nothing else for it excuse me harry said to the plump woman hello dear she said first time at hogwarts ron new too she pointed at the last and youngest of her son he wa tall thin and gangling with freckle big hand and foot and a long nose yes said harry the thing is the thing is i do not know how to how to get onto the platform she said kindly and harry nodded not to worry she said all you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platform nine and ten do not stop and do not be scared you will crash into it that is very important best do it at a bit of a run if you are nervous go on go now before ron page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling er okay said harry he pushed his trolley around and stared at the barrier it looked very solid he started to walk toward it people jostled him on their way to platform nine and ten harry walked more quickly he wa going to smash right into that barrier and then he would be in trouble leaning forward on his cart he broke into a heavy run the barrier wa coming nearer and nearer he would not be able to stop the cart wa out of control he wa a foot away he closed his eye ready for the crash it did not come he kept on running he opened his eye a scarlet steam engine wa waiting next to a platform packed with people a sign overhead said hogwarts express eleven of the clock harry looked behind him and saw a wroughtiron archway where the barrier had been with the word platform nine and three quarter on it he had done it smoke from the engine drifted over the head of the chattering crowd while cat of every color wound here and there between their leg owl hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunk the first few carriage were already packed with student some hanging out of the window to talk to their family some fighting over seat harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat he passed a roundfaced boy who wa saying gran i have lost my toad again oh neville he heard the old woman sigh page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling a boy with dreadlock wa surrounded by a small crowd give u a look lee go on the boy lifted the lid of a box in his arm and the people around him shrieked and yelled a something inside poked out a long hairy leg harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door he tried to lift it up the step but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot want a hand it wa one of the redhaired twin he would followed through the barrier yes please harry panted oy fred cmere and help with the twin help harrys trunk wa at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment thanks said harry pushing his sweaty hair out of his eye what is that said one of the twin suddenly pointing at harrys lightning scar blimey said the other twin are you he is said the first twin are not you he added to harry what said harry page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry potter chorused the twin oh him said harry i mean yes i am the two boy gawked at him and harry felt himself turning red then to his relief a voice came floating in through the train open door fred george are you there coming mom with a last look at harry the twin hopped off the train harry sat down next to the window where half hidden he could watch the redhaired family on the platform and hear what they were saying their mother had just taken out her handkerchief ron you

a though he need reminding of that on his first day at school all right keep your hair on a whistle sounded hurry up their mother said and the three boy clambered onto the train they leaned out of the window for her to kiss them goodbye and their younger sister began to cry do not ginny well send you load of owl well send you a hogwarts toilet seat georg e only joking mom the train began to move harry saw the boy mother waving and their sister half laughing half cry running to keep up with the train until it gathered too much speed then she fell back and waved harry watched the girl and her mother disappear a the train rounded the corner house flashed past the window harry felt a great leap of excitement he did not know what he wa going to but it had to be better than what he wa leaving behind the door of the compartment slid open and the youngest redheaded boy came in anyone sitting there he asked pointing at the seat opposite harry everywhere else is full page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry shook his head and the boy sat down he glanced at harry and then looked quickly out of the window pretending he had not looked harry saw he still had a black mark on his nose hey ron the twin were back listen were going down the middle of the train lee jordan got a giant tarantula down there right mumbled ron harry said the other twin did we introduce ourselves

stared so that is where youknowwho yes said harry but i can not remember it nothing said ron eagerly page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling well i remember a lot of green light but

harry who found ron just a interesting a ron found him er yes i think so said ron i think mom got a second cousin who is an accountant but we never talk about him so you must know load of magic

name scabbers and he useless he hardly ever wake up percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect but they could not aff i mean i got scabbers instead ron ear went pink he seemed to think he would said too much because he went back to staring out of the window harry did not think there wa anything wrong with not being able to afford an owl after all he would never had any money in his life until a month ago and he told ron so all about having to wear dudleys old clothes and never getting proper birthday present this seemed to cheer ron up and until hagrid told me i did not know anything about being a wizard or about my parent or voldemort ron gasped what said harry you said youknowwhos name said ron sounding both shocked and impressed id have thought you of all people i am not trying to be brave or anything saying the name said harry i just never knew you should not see what i mean i have got load to learn i bet he added voicing for the first time something that had page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling been worrying him a lot lately i bet i am the worst in the class you will not be there is load of people who come from muggle family and they learn quick enough while they had been talking the train had carried them out of london now they were speeding past field full of cow and sheep they were quiet for a time watching the field and lane flick past around half past twelve there wa a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling dimpled woman slid back their door and said anything off the cart dear harry who had not had any breakfast leapt to his foot but ron ear went pink again and he muttered that he would brought sandwich harry went out into the corridor he had never had any money for candy with the dursleys and now that he had pocket rattling with gold and silver he wa ready to buy a many mar bar a he could carry but the woman did not have mar bar what she did have were bertie botts every flavor bean droobles best blowing gum chocolate frog pumpkin pasty cauldron cake licorice wand and a number of other strange thing harry had never seen in his life not wanting to miss anything he got some of everything and paid the woman eleven silver sickle and seven bronze knut ron stared a harry brought it all back in to the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat hungry are you page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling starving said harry taking a large bite out of a pumpkin pasty ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it there were four sandwich inside he pulled one of them apart and said she always forgets i do not like corned beef swap you for one of these said harry holding up a pasty go on you do not want this it all dry said ron she ha not got much time he added quickly you know with five of u go on have a pasty said harry who had never had anything to share before or indeed anyone to share it with it wa a nice feeling sitting there with ron eating their way through all harrys pasty cake and candy the sandwich lay forgotten what are these harry asked ron holding up a pack of chocolate frog they are not really frog are they he wa starting to feel that nothing would surprise him no said ron but see what the card is i am missing agrippa what oh of course you would not know chocolate frog have card inside them you know to collect famous witch and wizard i have got about five hundred but i have not got agrippa or ptolemy harry unwrapped his chocolate frog and picked up the card it showed a man face he wore halfmoon glass had a long crooked nose and flowing silver page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hair beard and mustache underneath the picture wa the name albus dumbledore so this is dumbledore said harry do not tell me you would never heard of dumbledore said ron can i have a frog i might get agrippa thanks harry turned over his card and read albus dumbledore currently headmaster of hogwarts considered by many the greatest wizard of modern time dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve us of dragon blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamel professor dumbledore enjoys chamber music and ten pin bowling harry turned the card back over and saw to his astonishment that dumbledore s face had disappeared he gone well you can not expect him to hang around all day said ron hell be back no i have got morgana again and i have got about six of her do you want it you can start collecting ron eye strayed to the pile of chocolate frog waiting to be unwrapped help yourself said harry but in you know the muggle world people just stay put in photo page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling do they what they do not move at all ron sounded amazed weird harry stared a dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile ron wa more interested in eating the frog than looking at the famous witch and wizard card but harry could not keep his eye off them soon he had not only dumbledore and morgana but hengist of woodcraft alberic grunnion circe paracelsus and merlin he finally tore his eye away from the druidess cliodna who wa scratching her nose to open a bag of bertie botts every flavor bean you want to be careful with those ron warned harry when they say every flavor they mean every flavor you know you get all the ordinary one like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe george reckons he had a boogerflavored one once ron picked up a green bean looked at it carefully and bit into a corner bleaaargh see sprout they had a good time eating the every flavor bean harry got toast coconut baked bean strawberry curry grass coffee sardine and wa even brave enough to nibble the end off a funny gray one ron would not touch which turned out to be pepper the countryside now flying past the window wa becoming wilder the neat field had gone now there were wood twisting river and dark green hill there wa a knock on the door of their compartment and the roundfaced boy harry had passed on page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling platform nine and threequarters came in he looked tearful sorry he said but have you seen a toad at all when they shook their head he wailed i have lost him he keep getting away from me hell turn up said harry yes said the boy miserably well if you see him he left do not know why he so bothered said ron if id brought a toad id lose it a quick a i could mind you i brought scabbers so i can not talk the rat wa still snoozing on ron lap he might have died and you would not know the difference said ron in disgust i tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting but the spell did not work ill show you look he rummaged around in his trunk and pulled out a very batteredlooking wand it wa chipped in place and something white wa glinting at the end unicorn hair nearly poking out anyway he had just raised his wand when the compartment door slid open again the toadless boy wa back but this time he had a girl with him she wa already wearing her new hogwarts robe ha anyone seen a toad nevilles lost one she said she had a bossy sort of voice lot of bushy brown hair and rather large front teeth page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling we have already told him we have not seen it said ron but the girl wa not listening she wa looking at the wand in his hand oh are you doing magic let u see it then she sat down ron looked taken aback er all right he cleared his throat sunshine daisy butter mellow turn this stupid fat rat yellow he waved his wand but nothing happened scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep are you sure that is a real spell said the girl well it not very good is it i have tried a few simple spell just for practice and it all worked for me nobody in my family magic at all it wa ever such a surprise when i got my letter but i wa ever so pleased of course i mean it the very best school of witchcraft there is i have heard i have learned all our course book by heart of course i just hope it will be enough i am hermione granger by the way who are you she said all this very fast harry looked at ron and wa relieved to see by his stunned face that he had not learned all the course book by heart either i am ron weasley ron muttered harry potter said harry page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling are you really said hermione i know all about you of course i got a few extra book for background reading and you are in modern magical history and the rise and fall of the dark art and great wizarding event of the twentieth century am i said harry feeling dazed goodness did not you know id have found out everything i could if it wa me said hermione do either of you know what house you will be in i have been asking around and i hope i am in gryffindor it sound by far the best i hear dumbledore himself wa in it but i suppose ravenclaw would not be too bad anyway wed better go and look for nevilles toad you two had better change you know i expect well be there soon and she left taking the toadless boy with her whatever house i am in i hope she is not in it said ron he threw his wand back into his trunk stupid spell george gave it to me bet he knew it wa a dud what house are your brother in asked harry gryffindor said ron gloom seemed to be settling on him again mom and dad were in it too i do not know what they will say if i am not i do not suppose ravenclaw would be too bad but imagine if they put me in slytherin that is the house vol i mean youknowwho wa in yeah said ron he flopped back into his seat looking depressed page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you know i think the end of scabbers whisker are a bit lighter said harry trying to take ron mind off house so what do your oldest brother do now that they have left anyway harry wa wondering what a wizard did once he would finished school charlies in romania studying dragon and bill in africa doing something for gringotts said ron did you hear about gringotts it been all over the daily prophet but i do not suppose you get that with the muggles someone tried to rob a high security vault harry stared really what happened to them nothing that is why it such big news they have not been caught my dad say it must have been a powerful dark wizard to get round gringotts but they do not think they took anything that is what is odd course everyone get scared when something like this happens in case youknowwhos behind it harry turned this news over in his mind he wa starting to get a prickle of fear every time youknow who wa mentioned he supposed this wa all part of entering the magical world but it had been a lot more comfortable saying voldemort without worrying what is your quidditch team ron asked er i do not know any harry confessed what ron looked dumbfounded oh you wait it the best game in the world and he wa off explaining all about the four ball and the position of page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the seven player describing famous game he would been to with his brother and the broomstick he would like to get if he had the money he wa just taking harry through the finer point of the game when the compartment door slid open yet again but it wa not neville the toadless boy or hermione granger this time three boy entered and harry recognized the middle one at once it wa the pale boy from madam malkins robe shop he wa looking at harry with a lot more interest than he would shown back in diagon alley is it true he said they are saying all down the train that harry potter in this compartment so it you is it yes said harry he wa looking at the other boy both of them were thickset and looked extremely mean standing on either side of the pale boy they looked like bodyguard oh this is crabbe and this is goyle said the pale boy carelessly noticing where harry wa looking and my name malfoy draco malfoy ron gave a slight cough which might have been hiding a snigger draco malfoy looked at him think my name funny do you no need to ask who you are my father told me all the weasleys have red hair freckle and more child than they can afford he turned back to harry you will soon find out some wizarding family are much better than others potter you do not want to go making friend with the wrong sort i can help you there page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he held out his hand to shake harrys but harry did not take it i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks he said coolly draco malfoy did not go red but a pink tinge appeared in his pale cheek id be careful if i were you potter he said slowly unless you are a bit politer you will go the same way a your parent they did not know what wa good for them either you hang around with riffraff like the weasleys and that hagrid and it will rub off on you both harry and ron stood up say that again ron said his face a red a his hair oh you are going to fight u are you malfoy sneered unless you get out now said harry more bravely than he felt because crabbe and goyle were a lot bigger than him or ron but we do not feel like leaving do we boy we have eaten all our food and you still seem to have some goyle reached toward the chocolate frog next to ron ron leapt forward but before he would so much a touched goyle goyle let out a horrible yell scabbers the rat wa hanging off his finger sharp little teeth sunk deep into goyle s knuckle crabbe and malfoy backed away a goyle swung scabbers round and round howling and when scabbers finally flew off and hit the window all three of them disappeared at once perhaps they thought there were page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling more rat lurking among the sweet or perhaps they would heard footstep because a second later hermione granger had come in what ha been going on she said looking at the sweet all over the floor and ron picking up scabbers by his tail i think he been knocked out ron said to harry he looked closer at scabbers no i do not believe it he gone back to sleep and so he had you have met malfoy before harry explained about their meeting in diagon alley i have heard of his family said ron darkly they were some of the first to come back to our side after you knowwho disappeared said they would been bewitched my dad doe not believe it he say malfoys father did not need an excuse to go over to the dark side he turned to hermione can we help you with something you would better hurry up and put your robe on i have just been up to the front to ask the conductor and he say were nearly there you have not been fighting have you you will be in trouble before we even get there scabbers ha been fighting not u said ron scowling at her would you mind leaving while we change all right i only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly racing up and down the corridor said hermione in a sniffy voice page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling and you have got dirt on your nose by the way did you know ron glared at her a she left harry peered out of the window it wa getting dark he could see mountain and forest under a deep purple sky the train did seem to be slowing down he and ron took off their jacket and pulled on their long black robe ron were a bit short for him you could see his sneaker underneath them a voice echoed through the train we will be reaching hogwarts in five minute time please leave your luggage on the train it will be taken to the school separately harrys stomach lurched with nerve and ron he saw looked pale under his freckle they crammed their pocket with the last of the sweet and joined the crowd thronging the corridor the train slowed right down and finally stopped people pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny dark platform harry shivered in the cold night air then a lamp came bobbing over the head of the student and harry heard a familiar voice fir year fir year over here all right there harry hagrids big hairy face beamed over the sea of head cmon follow me any more fir year mind yer step now fir year follow me slipping and stumbling they followed hagrid down what seemed to be a steep narrow path it wa so dark on either side of them that harry thought there must be thick tree there nobody spoke much page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling neville the boy who kept losing his toad sniffed once or twice yehll get yer fir sight o hogwarts in a sec hagrid called over his shoulder jus round this bend here there wa a loud oooooh the narrow path had opened suddenly onto the edge of a great black lake perched atop a high mountain on the other side it window sparkling in the starry sky wa a vast castle with many turret and tower no moren four to a boat hagrid called pointing to a fleet of little boat sitting in the water by the shore harry and ron were followed into their boat by neville and hermione everyone in shouted hagrid who had a boat to himself right then forward and the fleet of little boat moved off all at once gliding across the lake which wa a smooth a glass everyone wa silent staring up at the great castle overhead it towered over them a they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood head down yelled hagrid a the first boat reached the cliff they all bent their head and the little boat carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face they were carried along a dark tunnel which seemed to be taking them right underneath the castle until they reached a kind of underground harbor where they clambered out onto rock and pebble oy you there is this your toad said hagrid who wa checking the boat a people climbed out of them page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling trevor cried neville blissfully holding out his hand then they clambered up a passageway in the rock after hagrids lamp coming out at last onto smooth damp grass right in the shadow of the castle they walked up a flight of stone step and crowded around the huge oak front door everyone here you there still got yer toad hagrid raised a gigantic fist and knocked three time on the castle door page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the sorting hat the door swung open at once a tall blackhaired witch in emeraldgreen robe stood there she had a very stern face and harrys first thought wa that this wa not someone to cross the fir year professor mcgonagall said hagrid thank you hagrid i will take them from here she pulled the door wide the entrance hall wa so big you could have fit the whole of the dursleys house in it the stone wall were lit with flaming torch like the one at gringotts the ceiling wa too high to make out and a magnificent marble staircase facing them led to the upper floor they followed professor mcgonagall across the flagged stone floor harry could hear the drone of hundred of voice from a doorway to the right the rest of the school must already be here but professor mcgonagall showed the first year into a small empty chamber off the hall they crowded in page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling standing rather closer together than they would usually have done peering about nervously welcome to hogwarts said professor mcgonagall the startofterm banquet will begin shortly but before you take your seat in the great hall you will be sorted into your house the sorting is a very important ceremony because while you are here your house will be something like your family within hogwarts you will have class with the rest of your house sleep in your house dormitory and spend free time in your house common room the four house are called gryffindor hufflepuff ravenclaw and slytherin each house ha it own noble history and each ha produced outstanding witch and wizard while you are at hogwarts your triumph will earn your house point while any rule breaking will lose house point at the end of the year the house with the most point is awarded the house cup a great honor i hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours the sorting ceremony will take place in a few minute in front of the rest of the school i suggest you all smarten yourselves up a much a you can while you are waiting her eye lingered for a moment on nevilles cloak which wa fastened under his left ear and on ron smudged nose harry nervously tried to flatten his hair i shall return when we are ready for you said professor mcgonagall please wait quietly she left the chamber harry swallowed page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling how exactly do they sort u into house he asked ron some sort of test i think fred said it hurt a lot but i think he wa joking harrys heart gave a horrible jolt a test in front of the whole school but he did not know any magic yet what on earth would he have to do he had not expected something like this the moment they arrived he looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified too no one wa talking much except hermione granger who wa whispering very fast about all the spell she would learned and wondering which one she would need harry tried hard not to listen to her he would never been more nervous never not even when he would had to take a school report home to the dursleys saying that he would somehow turned his teacher wig blue he kept his eye fixed on the door any second now professor mcgonagall would come back and lead him to his doom then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air several people behind him screamed what the he gasped so did the people around him about twenty ghost had just streamed through the back wall pearlywhite and slightly transparent they glided across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first year they seemed to be arguing what looked like a fat little monk wa saying forgive and forget i say we ought to give him a second chance my dear friar have not we given peeve all the chance he deserves he give u all a bad name and page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you know he not really even a ghost i say what are you all doing here a ghost wearing a ruff and tights had suddenly noticed the first year nobody answered new student said the fat friar smiling around at them about to be sorted i suppose a few people nodded mutely hope to see you in hufflepuff said the friar my old house you know move along now said a sharp voice the sorting ceremony about to start professor mcgonagall had returned one by one the ghost floated away through the opposite wall now form a line professor mcgonagall told the first year and follow me feeling oddly a though his leg had turned to lead harry got into line behind a boy with sandy hair with ron behind him and they walked out of the chamber back across the hall and through a pair of double door into the great hall harry had never even imagined such a strange and splendid place it wa lit by thousand and thousand of candle that were floating in midair over four long table where the rest of the student were sitting these table were laid with glittering golden plate and goblet at the top of the hall wa another long table where the teacher were sitting professor mcgonagall led the first year up here so that they page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling came to a halt in a line facing the other student with the teacher behind them the hundred of face staring at them looked like pale lantern in the flickering candlelight dotted here and there among the student the ghost shone misty silver mainly to avoid all the staring eye harry looked upward and saw a velvety black ceiling dotted with star he heard hermione whisper it bewitched to look like the sky outside i read about it in hogwarts a history it wa hard to believe there wa a ceiling there at all and that the great hall did not simply open on to the heaven harry quickly looked down again a professor mcgonagall silently placed a fourlegged stool in front of the first year on top of the stool she put a pointed wizard hat this hat wa patched and frayed and extremely dirty aunt petunia would not have let it in the house maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it harry thought wildly that seemed the sort of thing noticing that everyone in the hall wa now staring at the hat he stared at it too for a few second there wa complete silence then the hat twitched a rip near the brim opened wide like a mouth and the hat began to sing oh you may not think i am pretty but do not judge on what you see ill eat myself if you can find a smarter hat than me you can keep your bowler black page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling your top hat sleek and tall for i am the hogwarts sorting hat and i can cap them all there is nothing hidden in your head the sorting hat can not see so try me on and i will tell you where you ought to be you might belong in gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart their daring nerve and chivalry set gryffindors apart you might belong in hufflepuff where they are just and loyal those patient hufflepuffs are true and unafraid of toil or yet in wise old ravenclaw if you have a ready mind where those of wit and learning will always find their kind or perhaps in slytherin page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you will make your real friend those cunning folk use any mean to achieve their end so put me on do not be afraid l and do not get in a flap you are in safe hand though i have none for i am a thinking cap the whole hall burst into applause a the hat finished it song it bowed to each of the four table and then became quite still again so we have just got to try on the hat ron whispered to harry ill kill fred he wa going on about wrestling a troll harry smiled weakly yes trying on the hat wa a lot better than having to do a spell but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching the hat seemed to be asking rather a lot harry did not feel brave or quickwitted or any of it at the moment if only the hat had mentioned a house for people who felt a bit queasy that would have been the one for him professor mcgonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment when i call your name you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted she said abbott hannah page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling a pinkfaced girl with blonde pigtail stumbled out of line put on the hat which fell right down over her eye and sat down a moment pause hufflepuff shouted the hat the table on the right cheered and clapped a hannah went to sit down at the hufflepuff table harry saw the ghost of the fat friar waving merrily at her bone susan hufflepuff shouted the hat again and susan scuttled off to sit next to hannah boot terry ravenclaw the table second from the left clapped this time several ravenclaws stood up to shake hand with terry a he joined them brocklehurst mandy went to ravenclaw too but brown lavender became the first new gryffindor and the table on the far left exploded with cheer harry could see ron twin brother catcalling bulstrode millicent then became a slytherin perhaps it wa harrys imagination after all he would heard about slytherin but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot he wa starting to feel definitely sick now he remembered being picked for team during gym at his old school he had always been last to be chosen not because he wa no good but because no one wanted dudley to think they liked him page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling finchfletchley justin hufflepuff sometimes harry noticed the hat shouted out the house at once but at others it took a little while to decide finnigan seamus the sandyhaired boy next to harry in the line sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a gryffindor granger hermione hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head gryffindor shouted the hat ron groaned a horrible thought struck harry a horrible thought always do when you are very nervous what if he wa not chosen at all what if he just sat there with the hat over his eye for age until professor mcgonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he would better get back on the train when neville longbottom the boy who kept losing his toad wa called he fell over on his way to the stool the hat took a long time to decide with neville when it finally shouted gryffindor neville ran off still wearing it and had to jog back amid gale of laughter to give it to macdougal morag malfoy swaggered forward when his name wa called and got his wish at once the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed slytherin malfoy went to join his friend crabbe and goyle looking pleased with himself page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling there were not many people left now moon nott parkinson then a pair of twin girl path and path then perk sally anne and then at last potter harry a harry stepped forward whisper suddenly broke out like little hissing fire all over the hall potter did she say the harry potter the last thing harry saw before the hat dropped over his eye wa the hall full of people craning to get a good look at him next second he wa looking at the black inside of the hat he waited hmm said a small voice in his ear difficult very difficult plenty of courage i see not a bad mind either there is talent oh my goodness yes and a nice thirst to prove yourself now that is interesting so where shall i put you harry gripped the edge of the stool and thought not slytherin not slytherin not slytherin eh said the small voice are you sure you could be great you know it all here in your head and slytherin will help you on the way to greatness no doubt about that no well if you are sure better be gryffindor harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall he took off the hat and walked shakily toward the gryffindor table he wa so relieved to have been chosen and not put in slytherin he hardly noticed page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling that he wa getting the loudest cheer yet percy the prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously while the weasley twin yelled we got potter we got potter harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he would seen earlier the ghost patted his arm giving harry the sudden horrible feeling he would just plunged it into a bucket of icecold water he could see the high table properly now at the end nearest him sat hagrid who caught his eye and gave him the thumb up harry grinned back and there in the center of the high table in a large gold chair sat albus dumbledore harry recognized him at once from the card he would gotten out of the chocolate frog on the train dumbledores silver hair wa the only thing in the whole hall that shone a brightly a the ghost harry spotted professor quirrell too the nervous young man from the leaky cauldron he wa looking very peculiar in a large purple turban and now there were only four people left to be sorted thomas dean a black boy even taller than ron joined harry at the gryffindor table turpin lisa became a ravenclaw and then it wa ron turn he wa pale green by now harry crossed his finger under the table and a second later the hat had shouted gryffindor harry clapped loudly with the rest a ron collapsed into the chair next to him well done ron excellent said percy weasley pompously across harry a zabini blaise wa made a slytherin professor mcgonagall rolled up her scroll and took the sorting hat away harry looked down at his empty gold plate he had only just realized how hungry he wa the pumpkin pasty seemed age ago page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling albus dumbledore had gotten to his foot he wa beaming at the student his arm opened wide a if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there welcome he said welcome to a new year at hogwarts before we begin our banquet i would like to say a few word and here they are nitwit blubber oddment tweak thank you he sat back down everybody clapped and cheered harry did not know whether to laugh or not is he a bit mad he asked percy uncertainly mad said percy airily he a genius best wizard in the world but he is a bit mad yes potato harry harrys mouth fell open the dish in front of him were now piled with food he had never seen so many thing he liked to eat on one table roast beef roast chicken pork chop and lamb chop sausage bacon and steak boiled potato roast potato fry yorkshire pudding pea carrot gravy ketchup and for some strange reason peppermint humbug the dursleys had never exactly starved harry but he would never been allowed to eat a much a he liked dudley had always taken anything that harry really wanted even if it made him sick harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermint and began to eat it wa all delicious that doe look good said the ghost in the ruff sadly watching harry cut up his steak page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling can not you i have not eaten for nearly five hundred year said the ghost i do not need to of course but one doe miss it i do not think i have introduced myself sir nicholas de mimsyporpington at your service resident ghost of gryffindor tower i know who you are said ron suddenly my brother told me about you you are nearly headless nick i would prefer you to call me sir nicholas de mimsy the ghost began stiffly but sandyhaired seamus finnigan interrupted nearly headless how can you be nearly headless sir nicholas looked extremely miffed a if their little chat wa not going at all the way he wanted like this he said irritably he seized his left ear and pulled his whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder a if it wa on a hinge someone had obviously tried to behead him but not done it properly looking pleased at the stunned look on their face nearly headless nick flipped his head back onto his neck coughed and said so new gryffindors i hope you are going to help u win the house championship this year gryffindors have never gone so long without winning slytherins have got the cup six year in a row the bloody baron becoming almost unbearable he the slytherin ghost harry looked over at the slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there with blank staring eye a gaunt face and robe stained with silver blood he wa right next to malfoy who harry wa pleased to page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling see did not look too pleased with the seating arrangement how did he get covered in blood asked seamus with great interest i have never asked said nearly headless nick delicately when everyone had eaten a much a they could the remains of the food faded from the plate leaving them sparkling clean a before a moment later the dessert appeared block of ice cream in every flavor you could think of apple pie treacle tart chocolate eclair and jam doughnut trifle strawberry jell rice pudding a harry helped himself to a treacle tart the talk turned to their family i am halfandhalf said seamus me dad a muggle mom did not tell him she wa a witch til after they were married bit of a nasty shock for him the others laughed what about you neville said ron well my gran brought me up and she is a witch said neville but the family thought i wa all muggle for age my great uncle algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me he pushed me off the end of blackpool pier once i nearly drowned but nothing happened until i wa eight great uncle algie came round for dinner and he wa hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankle when my great auntie enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go but i bounced all the way down the garden and into the road they were all page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling really pleased gran wa cry she wa so happy and you should have seen their face when i got in here they thought i might not be magic enough to come you see great uncle algie wa so pleased he bought me my toad on harrys other side percy weasley and hermione were talking about lesson i do hope they start right away there is so much to learn i am particularly interested in transfiguration you know turning something into something else of course it supposed to be very difficult you will be starting small just match into needle and that sort of thing harry who wa starting to feel warm and sleepy looked up at the high table again hagrid wa drinking deeply from his goblet professor mcgonagall wa talking to professor dumbledore professor quirrell in his absurd turban wa talking to a teacher with greasy black hair a hooked nose and sallow skin it happened very suddenly the hooknosed teacher looked past quirrells turban straight into harrys eye and a sharp hot pain shot across the scar on harrys forehead ouch harry clapped a hand to his head what is it asked percy nnothing the pain had gone a quickly a it had come harder to shake off wa the feeling harry had gotten from the teacher look a feeling that he did not like harry at all page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling who is that teacher talking to professor quirrell he asked percy oh you know quirrell already do you no wonder he looking so nervous that is professor snape he teach potion but he doe not want to everyone know he after quirrells job know an awful lot about the dark art snape harry watched snape for a while but snape did not look at him again at last the dessert too disappeared and professor dumbledore got to his foot again the hall fell silent ahem just a few more word now that we are all fed and watered i have a few startofterm notice to give you first year should note that the forest on the ground is forbidden to all pupil and a few of our older student would do well to remember that a well dumbledore s twinkling eye flashed in the direction of the weasley twin i have also been asked by mr filch the caretaker to remind you all that no magic should be used between class in the corridor quidditch trial will be held in the second week of the term anyone interested in playing for their house team should contact madam hooch and finally i must tell you that this year the third floor corridor on the righthand side is out of bound to everyone who doe not wish to die a very painful death page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry laughed but he wa one of the few who did he not serious he muttered to percy must be said percy frowning at dumbledore it odd because he usually give u a reason why were not allowed to go somewhere the forest full of dangerous beast everyone know that i do think he might have told u prefect at least and now before we go to bed let u sing the school song cried dumbledore harry noticed that the other teacher smile had become rather fixed dumbledore gave his wand a little flick a if he wa trying to get a fly off the end and a long golden ribbon flew out of it which rose high above the table and twisted itself snakelike into word everyone pick their favorite tune said dumbledore and off we go and the school bellowed hogwarts hogwarts hoggy warty hogwarts teach u something please whether we be old and bald or young with scabby knee our head could do with filling with some interesting stuff for now they are bare and full of air dead fly and bit of fluff page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling so teach u thing worth knowing bring back what we have forgot just do your best well do the rest and learn until our brain all rot everybody finished the song at different time at last only the weasley twin were left singing along to a very slow funeral march dumbledore conducted their last few line with his wand and when they had finished he wa one of those who clapped loudest ah music he said wiping his eye a magic beyond all we do here and now bedtime off you trot the gryffindor first year followed percy through the chattering crowd out of the great hall and up the marble staircase harrys leg were like lead again but only because he wa so tired and full of food he wa too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portrait along the corridor whispered and pointed a they passed or that twice percy led them through doorway hidden behind sliding panel and hanging tapestry they climbed more staircase yawning and dragging their foot and harry wa just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt a bundle of walking stick wa floating in midair ahead of them and a percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him peeve percy whispered to the first year a poltergeist he raised his voice peeve show yourself page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling a loud rude sound like the air being let out of a balloon answered do you want me to go to the bloody baron there wa a pop and a little man with wicked dark eye and a wide mouth appeared floating cross legged in the air clutching the walking stick oooooooh he said with an evil cackle ickle firsties what fun he swooped suddenly at them they all ducked go away peeve or the baronll hear about this i mean it barked percy peeve stuck out his tongue and vanished dropping the walking stick on nevilles head they heard him zooming away rattling coat of armor a he passed you want to watch out for peeve said percy a they set off again the bloody baron the only one who can control him he will not even listen to u prefect here we are at the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress password she said caput draconis said percy and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall they all scrambled through it neville needed a leg up and found themselves in the gryffindor common room a cozy round room full of squashy armchair percy directed the girl through one door to their dormitory and the boy through another at the top of page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling a spiral staircase they were obviously in one of the tower they found their bed at last five four poster hung with deep red velvet curtain their trunk had already been brought up too tired to talk much they pulled on their pajama and fell into bed great food is not it ron muttered to harry through the hanging get off scabbers he chewing my sheet harry wa going to ask ron if he would had any of the treacle tart but he fell asleep almost at once perhaps harry had eaten a bit too much because he had a very strange dream he wa wearing professor quirrells turban which kept talking to him telling him he must transfer to slytherin at once because it wa his destiny harry told the turban he did not want to be in slytherin it got heavier and heavier he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully and there wa malfoy laughing at him a he struggled with it then malfoy turned into the hooknosed teacher snape whose laugh became high and cold there wa a burst of green light and harry woke sweating and shaking he rolled over and fell asleep again and when he woke next day he did not remember the dream at all page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the potion master there look where next to the tall kid with the red hair wearing the glass did you see his face did you see his scar whisper followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day people lining up outside classroom stood on tiptoe to get a look at him or doubled back to pas him in the corridor again staring harry wished they would not because he wa trying to concentrate on finding his way to class there were a hundred and fortytwo staircase at hogwarts wide sweeping one narrow rickety one some that led somewhere different on a friday some page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling with a vanishing step halfway up that you had to remember to jump then there were door that would not open unless you asked politely or tickled them in exactly the right place and door that were not really door at all but solid wall just pretending it wa also very hard to remember where anything wa because it all seemed to move around a lot the people in the portrait kept going to visit each other and harry wa sure the coat of armor could walk the ghost did not help either it wa always a nasty shock when one of them glided suddenly through a door you were trying to open nearly headless nick wa always happy to point new gryffindors in the right direction but peeve the poltergeist wa worth two locked door and a trick staircase if you met him when you were late for class he would drop wastepaper basket on your head pull rug from under your foot pelt you with bit of chalk or sneak up behind you invisible grab your nose and screech got your conk even worse than peeve if that wa possible wa the caretaker argus filch harry and ron managed to get on the wrong side of him on their very first morning filch found them trying to force their way through a door that unluckily turned out to be the entrance to the outofbounds corridor on the third floor he would not believe they were lost wa sure they were trying to break into it on purpose and wa threatening to lock them in the dungeon when they were rescued by professor quirrell who wa passing filch owned a cat called mr norris a scrawny dust colored creature with bulging lamplike eye just like filchs she patrolled the corridor alone break a rule in front of her put just one toe out of line and she would whisk off for filch who would appear wheezing two second later filch knew the secret passageway of page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the school better than anyone except perhaps the weasley twin and could pop up a suddenly a any of the ghost the student all hated him and it wa the dearest ambition of many to give mr norris a good kick and then once you had managed to find them there were the class themselves there wa a lot more to magic a harry quickly found out than waving your wand and saying a few funny word they had to study the night sky through their telescope every wednesday at midnight and learn the name of different star and the movement of the planet three time a week they went out to the greenhouse behind the castle to study herbology with a dumpy little witch called professor sprout where they learned how to take care of all the strange plant and fungi and found out what they were used for easily the most boring class wa history of magic which wa the only one taught by a ghost professor binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep in front of the staff room fire and got up next morning to teach leaving his body behind him binns droned on and on while they scribbled down name and date and got emeric the evil and uric the oddball mixed up professor flitwick the charm teacher wa a tiny little wizard who had to stand on a pile of book to see over his desk at the start of their first class he took the roll call and when he reached harrys name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out of sight professor mcgonagall wa again different harry had been quite right to think she wa not a teacher to page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling cross strict and clever she gave them a talking to the moment they sat down in her first class transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at hogwarts she said anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back you have been warned then she changed her desk into a pig and back again they were all very impressed and could not wait to get started but soon realized they were not going to be changing the furniture into animal for a long time after taking a lot of complicated note they were each given a match and started trying to turn it into a needle by the end of the lesson only hermione granger had made any difference to her match professor mcgonagall showed the class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave hermione a rare smile the class everyone had really been looking forward to wa defense against the dark art but quirrells lesson turned out to be a bit of a joke his classroom smelled strongly of garlic which everyone said wa to ward off a vampire he would met in romania and wa afraid would be coming back to get him one of these day his turban he told them had been given to him by an african prince a a thankyou for getting rid of a troublesome zombie but they were not sure they believed this story for one thing when seamus finnigan asked eagerly to hear how quirrell had fought off the zombie quirrell went pink and started talking about the weather for another they had noticed that a funny smell hung around the turban and the weasley twin insisted that it wa stuffed full of garlic a well so that quirrell wa protected wherever he went page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry wa very relieved to find out that he wa not mile behind everyone else lot of people had come from muggle family and like him had not had any idea that they were witch and wizard there wa so much to learn that even people like ron did not have much of a head start friday wa an important day for harry and ron they finally managed to find their way down to the great hall for breakfast without getting lost once what have we got today harry asked ron a he poured sugar on his porridge double potion with the slytherins said ron snapes head of slytherin house they say he always favor them well be able to see if it true wish mcgonagall favored u said harry professor mcgonagall wa head of gryffindor house but it had not stopped her from giving them a huge pile of homework the day before just then the mail arrived harry had gotten used to this by now but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning when about a hundred owl had suddenly streamed into the great hall during breakfast circling the table until they saw their owner and dropping letter and package onto their lap hedwig had not brought harry anything so far she sometimes flew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the owlery with the other school owl this morning however she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar bowl and dropped a note onto harrys plate harry tore it open at once it said in a very untidy scrawl page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling dear harry i know you get friday afternoon off so would you like to come and have a cup of tea with me around three i want to hear all about your first week send u an answer back with hedwig hagrid harry borrowed ron quill scribbled yes please see you later on the back of the note and sent hedwig off again it wa lucky that harry had tea with hagrid to look forward to because the potion lesson turned out to be the worst thing that had happened to him so far at the startofterm banquet harry had gotten the idea that professor snape disliked him by the end of the first potion lesson he knew he would been wrong snape did not dislike harry he hated him potion lesson took place down in one of the dungeon it wa colder here than up in the main castle and would have been quite creepy enough without the pickled animal floating in glass jar all around the wall snape like flitwick started the class by taking the roll call and like flitwick he paused at harrys name ah yes he said softly harry potter our new celebrity draco malfoy and his friend crabbe and goyle sniggered behind their hand snape finished calling the name and looked up at the class his eye were black like hagrid s but they had none of hagrid s page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling warmth they were cold and empty and made you think of dark tunnel you are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking he began he spoke in barely more than a whisper but they caught every word like professor mcgonagall snape had the gift of keeping a class silent without effort a there is little foolish wand waving here many of you will hardly believe this is magic i do not expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with it shimmering fume the delicate power of liquid that creep through human vein bewitching the mind ensnaring the sens i can teach you how to bottle fame brew glory even stopper death if you are not a big a bunch of dunderhead a i usually have to teach more silence followed this little speech harry and ron exchanged look with raised eyebrow hermione granger wa on the edge of her seat and looked desperate to start proving that she wa not a dunderhead potter said snape suddenly what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood powdered root of what to an infusion of what harry glanced at ron who looked a stumped a he wa hermione s hand had shot into the air i do not know sir said harry snape s lip curled into a sneer tut tut fame clearly is not everything he ignored hermione s hand page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling let u try again potter where would you look if i told you to find me a bezoar hermione stretched her hand a high into the air a it would go without her leaving her seat but harry did not have the faintest idea what a bezoar wa he tried not to look at malfoy crabbe and goyle who were shaking with laughter i do not know sir thought you would not open a book before coming eh potter harry forced himself to keep looking straight into those cold eye he had looked through his book at the dursleys but did snape expect him to remember everything in one thousand magical herb and fungi snape wa still ignoring hermiones quivering hand what is the difference potter between monkshood and wolfsbane at this hermione stood up her hand stretching toward the dungeon ceiling i do not know said harry quietly i think hermione doe though why do not you try her a few people laughed harry caught seamuss eye and seamus winked snape however wa not pleased sit down he snapped at hermione for your information potter asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known a the draught of living death a bezoar is a stone taken page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poison a for monkshood and wolfsbane they are the same plant which also go by the name of aconite well why are not you all copying that down there wa a sudden rummaging for quill and parchment over the noise snape said and a point will be taken from gryffindor house for your cheek potter thing did not improve for the gryffindors a the potion lesson continued snape put them all into pair and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boil he swept around in his long black cloak watching them weigh dried nettle and crush snake fang criticizing almost everyone except malfoy whom he seemed to like he wa just telling everyone to look at the perfect way malfoy had stewed his horned slug when cloud of acid green smoke and a loud hissing filled the dungeon neville had somehow managed to melt seamuss cauldron into a twisted blob and their potion wa seeping across the stone floor burning hole in people shoe within second the whole class wa standing on their stool while neville who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron collapsed moaned in pain a angry red boil sprang up all over his arm and leg idiot boy snarled snape clearing the spilled potion away with one wave of his wand i suppose you added the porcupine quill before taking the cauldron off the fire neville whimpered a boil started to pop up all over his nose take him up to the hospital wing snape spat at seamus then he rounded on harry and ron who had been working next to neville page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you potter why did not you tell him not to add the quill thought he would make you look good if he got it wrong did you that is another point you have lost for gryffindor this wa so unfair that harry opened his mouth to argue but ron kicked him behind their cauldron do not push it he muttered i have heard snape can turn very nasty a they climbed the step out of the dungeon an hour later harrys mind wa racing and his spirit were low he would lost two point for gryffindor in his very first week why did snape hate him so much cheer up said ron snapes always taking point off fred and george can i come and meet hagrid with you at five to three they left the castle and made their way across the ground hagrid lived in a small wooden house on the edge of the forbidden forest a crossbow and a pair of galosh were outside the front door when harry knocked they heard a frantic scrabbling from inside and several booming bark then hagrid s voice rang out saying back fang back hagrid s big hairy face appeared in the crack a he pulled the door open hang on he said back fang he let them in struggling to keep a hold on the collar of an enormous black boarhound there wa only one room inside ham and pheasant were hanging from the ceiling a copper kettle wa page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling boiling on the open fire and in the corner stood a massive bed with a patchwork quilt over it make yerselves at home said hagrid letting go of fang who bounded straight at ron and started licking his ear like hagrid fang wa clearly not a fierce a he looked this is ron harry told hagrid who wa pouring boiling water into a large teapot and putting rock cake onto a plate another weasley eh said hagrid glancing at ron freckle i spent half me life chasin yer twin brother away from the forest the rock cake were shapeless lump with raisin that almost broke their teeth but harry and ron pretended to be enjoying them a they told hagrid all about their first lesson fang rested his head on harrys knee and drooled all over his robe harry and ron were delighted to hear hagrid call filch that old git an a fer that cat mr norris id like ter introduce her to fang sometime dyeh know every time i go up ter the school she follows me everywhere can not get rid of her filch put her up to it harry told hagrid about snapes lesson hagrid like ron told harry not to worry about it that snape liked hardly any of the student but he seemed to really hate me rubbish said hagrid why should he page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling yet harry could not help thinking that hagrid did not quite meet his eye when he said that how is yer brother charlie hagrid asked ron i liked him a lot great with animal harry wondered if hagrid had changed the subject on purpose while ron told hagrid all about charlies work with dragon harry picked up a piece of paper that wa lying on the table under the tea cozy it wa a cutting from the daily prophet gringotts breakin latest investigation continue into the breakin at gringotts on july widely believed to be the work of dark wizard or witch unknown gringotts goblin today insisted that nothing had been taken the vault that wa searched had in fact been emptied the same day but were not telling you what wa in there so keep your nose out if you know what is good for you said a gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon harry remembered ron telling him on the train that someone had tried to rob gringotts but ron had not mentioned the date hagrid said harry that gringotts breakin happened on my birthday it might have been happening while we were there there wa no doubt about it hagrid definitely did not meet harrys eye this time he grunted and offered him another rock cake harry read the story again the vault that wa searched had in fact been emptied earlier that same day hagrid had emptied vault seven page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hundred and thirteen if you could call it emptying taking out that grubby little package had that been what the thief were looking for a harry and ron walked back to the castle for dinner their pocket weighed down with rock cake they would been too polite to refuse harry thought that none of the lesson he would had so far had given him a much to think about a tea with hagrid had hagrid collected that package just in time where wa it now and did hagrid know something about snape that he did not want to tell harry page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the midnight duel harry had never believed he would meet a boy he hated more than dudley but that wa before he met draco malfoy still firstyear gryffindors only had potion with the slytherins so they did not have to put up with malfoy much or at least they did not until they spotted a notice pinned up in the gryffindor common room that made them all groan flying lesson would be starting on thursday and gryffindor and slytherin would be learning together typical said harry darkly just what i always wanted to make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of malfoy he had been looking forward to learning to fly more than anything else you do not know that you will make a fool of yourself said ron reasonably anyway i know malfoys always going on about how good he is at quidditch but i bet that is all talk page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling malfoy certainly did talk about flying a lot he complained loudly about first year never getting on the house quidditch team and told long boastful story that always seemed to end with him narrowly escaping muggles in helicopter he wa not the only one though the way seamus finnigan told it he would spent most of his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broomstick even ron would tell anyone who would listen about the time he would almost hit a hang glider on charlies old broom everyone from wizarding family talked about quidditch constantly ron had already had a big argument with dean thomas who shared their dormitory about soccer ron could not see what wa exciting about a game with only one ball where no one wa allowed to fly harry had caught ron prodding dean poster of west ham soccer team trying to make the player move neville had never been on a broomstick in his life because his grandmother had never let him near one privately harry felt she would had good reason because neville managed to have an extraordinary number of accident even with both foot on the ground hermione granger wa almost a nervous about flying a neville wa this wa something you could not learn by heart out of a book not that she had not tried at breakfast on thursday she bored them all stupid with flying tip she would gotten out of a library book called quidditch through the age neville wa hanging on to her every word desperate for anything that might help him hang on to his broomstick later but everybody else wa very pleased when hermione s lecture wa interrupted by the arrival of the mail harry had not had a single letter since hagrids note something that malfoy had been quick to notice of course malfoy s eagle owl wa always bringing him page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling package of sweet from home which he opened gloatingly at the slytherin table a barn owl brought neville a small package from his grandmother he opened it excitedly and showed them a glass ball the size of a large marble which seemed to be full of white smoke it a remembrall he explained gran know i forget thing this tell you if there is something you have forgotten to do look you hold it tight like this and if it turn red oh his face fell because the remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet you have forgotten something neville wa trying to remember what he would forgotten when draco malfoy who wa passing the gryffindor table snatched the remembrall out of his hand harry and ron jumped to their foot they were half hoping for a reason to fight malfoy but professor mcgonagall who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher in the school wa there in a flash what is going on malfoys got my remembrall professor scowling malfoy quickly dropped the remembrall back on the table just looking he said and he sloped away with crabbe and goyle behind him at threethirty that afternoon harry ron and the other gryffindors hurried down the front step onto the ground for their first flying lesson it wa a clear breezy day and the grass rippled under their foot a they marched down the sloping lawn toward a page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling smooth flat lawn on the opposite side of the ground to the forbidden forest whose tree were swaying darkly in the distance the slytherins were already there and so were twenty broomstick lying in neat line on the ground harry had heard fred and george weasley complain about the school broom saying that some of them started to vibrate if you flew too high or always flew slightly to the left their teacher madam hooch arrived she had short gray hair and yellow eye like a hawk well what are you all waiting for she barked everyone stand by a broomstick come on hurry up harry glanced down at his broom it wa old and some of the twig stuck out at odd angle stick out your right hand over your broom called madam hooch at the front and say up up everyone shouted harrys broom jumped into his hand at once but it wa one of the few that did hermione granger had simply rolled over on the ground and nevilles had not moved at all perhaps broom like horse could tell when you were afraid thought harry there wa a quaver in nevilles voice that said only too clearly that he wanted to keep his foot on the ground madam hooch then showed them how to mount their broom without sliding off the end and walked up and down the row correcting their grip harry and ron were delighted when she told malfoy he would been doing it wrong for year page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling now when i blow my whistle you kick off from the ground hard said madam hooch keep your broom steady rise a few foot and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly on my whistle three two but neville nervous and jumpy and frightened of being left on the ground pushed off hard before the whistle had touched madam hooch lip come back boy she shouted but neville wa rising straight up like a cork shot out of a bottle twelve foot twenty foot harry saw his scared white face look down at the ground falling away saw him gasp slip sideways off the broom and wham a thud and a nasty crack and neville lay facedown on the grass in a heap his broomstick wa still rising higher and higher and started to drift lazily toward the forbidden forest and out of sight madam hooch wa bending over neville her face a white a his broken wrist harry heard her mutter come on boy it all right up you get she turned to the rest of the class none of you is to move while i take this boy to the hospital wing you leave those broom where they are or you will be out of hogwarts before you can say quidditch come on dear neville his face tearstreaked clutching his wrist hobbled off with madam hooch who had her arm around him page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling no sooner were they out of earshot than malfoy burst into laughter did you see his face the great lump the other slytherins joined in shut up malfoy snapped parvati patil ooh sticking up for longbottom said pansy parkinson a hardfaced slytherin girl never thought you would like fat little crybaby parvati look said malfoy darting forward and snatching something out of the grass it that stupid thing longbottoms gran sent him the remembrall glittered in the sun a he held it up give that here malfoy said harry quietly everyone stopped talking to watch malfoy smiled nastily i think ill leave it somewhere for longbottom to find how about up a tree give it here harry yelled but malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off he had not been lying he could fly well hovering level with the topmost branch of an oak he called come and get it potter harry grabbed his broom ivo shouted hermione granger madam hooch told u not to move you will get u all into trouble page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry ignored her blood wa pounding in his ear he mounted the broom and kicked hard against the ground and up up he soared air rushed through his hair and his robe whipped out behind him and in a rush of fierce joy he realized he would found something he could do without being taught this wa easy this wa wonderful he pulled his broomstick up a little to take it even higher and heard scream and gasp of girl back on the ground and an admiring whoop from ron he turned his broomstick sharply to face malfoy in midair malfoy looked stunned give it here harry called or ill knock you off that broom oh yeah said malfoy trying to sneer but looking worried harry knew somehow what to do he leaned forward and grasped the broom tightly in both hand and it shot toward malfoy like a javelin malfoy only just got out of the way in time harry made a sharp about face and held the broom steady a few people below were clapping no crabbe and goyle up here to save your neck malfoy harry called the same thought seemed to have struck malfoy catch it if you can then he shouted and he threw the glass ball high into the air and streaked back toward the ground harry saw a though in slow motion the ball rise up in the air and then start to fall he leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down next second page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he wa gathering speed in a steep dive racing the ball wind whistled in his ear mingled with the scream of people watching he stretched out his hand a foot from the ground he caught it just in time to pull his broom straight and he toppled gently onto the grass with the remembrall clutched safely in his fist harry potter his heart sank faster than he would just dived professor mcgonagall wa running toward them he got to his foot trembling never in all my time at hogwarts professor mcgonagall wa almost speechless with shock and her glass flashed furiously how dare you might have broken your neck it wa not his fault professor be quiet miss patil but malfoy that is enough mr weasley potter follow me now harry caught sight of malfoy crabbe and goyles triumphant face a he left walking numbly in professor mcgonagalls wake a she strode toward the castle he wa going to be expelled he just knew it he wanted to say something to defend himself but there seemed to be something wrong with his voice professor mcgonagall wa sweeping along without even looking at him he had to jog to keep up now he would done it he had not even lasted two week he would be packing his bag in ten minute what would the dursleys say when he turned up on the doorstep page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling up the front step up the marble staircase inside and still professor mcgonagall did not say a word to him she wrenched open door and marched along corridor with harry trotting miserably behind her maybe she wa taking him to dumbledore he thought of hagrid expelled but allowed to stay on a gamekeeper perhaps he could be hagrids assistant his stomach twisted a he imagined it watching ron and the others becoming wizard while he stumped around the ground carrying hagrids bag professor mcgonagall stopped outside a classroom she opened the door and poked her head inside excuse me professor flitwick could i borrow wood for a moment wood thought harry bewildered wa wood a cane she wa going to use on him but wood turned out to be a person a burly fifthyear boy who came out of flitwicks class looking confused follow me you two said professor mcgonagall and they marched on up the corridor wood looking curiously at harry in here professor mcgonagall pointed them into a classroom that wa empty except for peeve who wa busy writing rude word on the blackboard out peeve she barked peeve threw the chalk into a bin which clanged loudly and he swooped out cursing professor mcgonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the two boy page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling potter this is oliver wood wood i have found you a seeker wood expression changed from puzzlement to delight are you serious professor absolutely said professor mcgonagall crisply the boy a natural i have never seen anything like it wa that your first time on a broomstick potter harry nodded silently he did not have a clue what wa going on but he did not seem to be being expelled and some of the feeling started coming back to his leg he caught that thing in his hand after a fiftyfoot dive professor mcgonagall told wood did not even scratch himself charlie weasley could not have done it wood wa now looking a though all his dream had come true at once ever seen a game of quidditch potter he asked excitedly wood captain of the gryffindor team professor mcgonagall explained he just the build for a seeker too said wood now walking around harry and staring at him light speedy well have to get him a decent broom professor a nimbus two thousand or a cleansweep seven id say i shall speak to professor dumbledore and see if we can not bend the firstyear rule heaven know we need a better team than last year flattened in that last page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling match by slytherin i could not look severus snape in the face for week professor mcgonagall peered sternly over her glass at harry i want to hear you are training hard potter or i may change my mind about punishing you then she suddenly smiled your father would have been proud she said he wa an excellent quidditch player himself you are joking it wa dinnertime harry had just finished telling ron what had happened when he would left the ground with professor mcgonagall ron had a piece of steak and kidney pie halfway to his mouth but he would forgotten all about it seeker he said but first year never you must be the youngest house player in about a century said harry shoveling pie into his mouth he felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon wood told me ron wa so amazed so impressed he just sat and gaped at harry i start training next week said harry only do not tell anyone wood want to keep it a secret fred and george weasley now came into the hall spotted harry and hurried over page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling well done said george in a low voice wood told u were on the team too beater i tell you were going to win that quidditch cup for sure this year said fred we have not won since charlie left but this year team is going to be brilliant you must be good harry wood wa almost skipping when he told u anyway we have got to go lee jordan reckons he found a new secret passageway out of the school bet it that one behind the statue of gregory the smarmy that we found in our first week see you fred and george had hardly disappeared when someone far le welcome turned up malfoy flanked by crabbe and goyle having a last meal potter when are you getting the train back to the muggles you are a lot braver now that you are back on the ground and you have got your little friend with you said harry coolly there wa of course nothing at all little about crabbe and goyle but a the high table wa full of teacher neither of them could do more than crack their knuckle and scowl id take you on anytime on my own said malfoy tonight if you want wizard duel wand only no contact what is the matter never heard of a wizard duel before i suppose of course he ha said ron wheeling around i am his second who is yours malfoy looked at crabbe and goyle sizing them up page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling crabbe he said midnight all right well meet you in the trophy room that is always unlocked when malfoy had gone ron and harry looked at each other what is a wizard duel said harry and what do you mean you are my second well a second there to take over if you die said ron casually getting started at last on his cold pie catching the look on harrys face he added quickly but people only die in proper duel you know with real wizard the most you and malfoyll be able to do is send spark at each other neither of you know enough magic to do any real damage i bet he expected you to refuse anyway and what if i wave my wand and nothing happens throw it away and punch him on the nose ron suggested excuse me they both looked up it wa hermione granger can not a person eat in peace in this place said ron hermione ignored him and spoke to harry i could not help overhearing what you and malfoy were saying bet you could ron muttered and you must not go wandering around the school at night think of the point you will lose gryffindor if page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you are caught and you are bound to be it really very selfish of you and it really none of your business said harry goodbye said ron all the same it wa not what you would call the perfect end to the day harry thought a he lay awake much later listening to dean and seamus falling asleep neville wa not back from the hospital wing ron had spent all evening giving him advice such a if he try to curse you you would better dodge it because i can not remember how to block them there wa a very good chance they were going to get caught by filch or mr norris and harry felt he wa pushing his luck breaking another school rule today on the other hand malfoys sneering face kept looming up out of the darkness this wa his big chance to beat malfoy facetoface he could not miss it halfpast eleven ron muttered at last wed better go they pulled on their bathrobe picked up their wand and crept across the tower room down the spiral staircase and into the gryffindor common room a few ember were still glowing in the fireplace turning all the armchair into hunched black shadow they had almost reached the portrait hole when a voice spoke from the chair nearest them i can not believe you are going to do this harry a lamp flickered on it wa hermione granger wearing a pink bathrobe and a frown you said ron furiously go back to bed page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i almost told your brother hermione snapped percy he a prefect he would put a stop to this harry could not believe anyone could be so interfering come on he said to ron he pushed open the portrait of the fat lady and climbed through the hole hermione wa not going to give up that easily she followed ron through the portrait hole hissing at them like an angry goose do not you care about gryffindor do you only care about yourselves do not want slytherin to win the house cup and you will lose all the point i got from professor mcgonagall for knowing about switching spell go away all right but i warned you you just remember what i said when you are on the train home tomorrow you are so but what they were they did not find out hermione had turned to the portrait of the fat lady to get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting the fat lady had gone on a nighttime visit and hermione wa locked out of gryffindor tower now what am i going to do she asked shrilly that is your problem said ron we have got to go were going to be late they had not even reached the end of the corridor when hermione caught up with them i am coming with you she said page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you are not dyou think i am going to stand out here and wait for filch to catch me if he find all three of u ill tell him the truth that i wa trying to stop you and you can back me up you have got some nerve said ron loudly shut up both of you said harry sharply i heard something it wa a sort of snuffling mr norris breathed ron squinting through the dark it wa not mr norris it wa neville he wa curled up on the floor fast asleep but jerked suddenly awake a they crept nearer thank goodness you found me i have been out here for hour i could not remember the new password to get in to bed keep your voice down neville the password pig snout but it will not help you now the fat lady gone off somewhere how is your arm said harry fine said neville showing them madam pomfrey mended it in about a minute good well look neville we have got to be somewhere well see you later page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling do not leave me said neville scrambling to his foot i do not want to stay here alone the bloody baron been past twice already ron looked at his watch and then glared furiously at hermione and neville if either of you get u caught ill never rest until i have learned that curse of the bogy quirrell told u about and used it on you hermione opened her mouth perhaps to tell ron exactly how to use the curse of the bogy but harry hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned them all forward they flitted along corridor striped with bar of moonlight from the high window at every turn harry expected to run into filch or mr norris but they were lucky they sped up a staircase to the third floor and tiptoed toward the trophy room malfoy and crabbe were not there yet the crystal trophy case glimmered where the moonlight caught them cup shield plate and statue winked silver and gold in the darkness they edged along the wall keeping their eye on the door at either end of the room harry took out his wand in case malfoy leapt in and started at once the minute crept by he late maybe he chickened out ron whispered then a noise in the next room made them jump harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wa not malfoy sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling it wa filch speaking to mr norris horrorstruck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him a quickly a possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filchs voice nevilles robe had barely whipped round the corner when they heard filch enter the trophy room they are in here somewhere they heard him mutter probably hiding this way harry mouthed to the others and petrified they began to creep down a long gallery full of suit of armor they could hear filch getting nearer neville suddenly let out a frightened squeak and broke into a run he tripped grabbed ron around the waist and the pair of them toppled right into a suit of armor the clanging and crashing were enough to wake the whole castle run harry yelled and the four of them sprinted down the gallery not looking back to see whether filch wa following they swung around the doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another harry in the lead without any idea where they were or where they were going they ripped through a tapestry and found themselves in a hidden passageway hurtled along it and came out near their charm classroom which they knew wa mile from the trophy room i think we have lost him harry panted leaning against the cold wall and wiping his forehead neville wa bent double wheezing and spluttering i told you hermione gasped clutching at the stitch in her chest i told you page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling we have got to get back to gryffindor tower said ron quickly a possible malfoy tricked you hermione said to harry you realize that do not you he wa never going to meet you filch knew someone wa going to be in the trophy room malfoy must have tipped him off harry thought she wa probably right but he wa not going to tell her that let u go it wa not going to be that simple they had not gone more than a dozen pace when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in front of them it wa peeve he caught sight of them and gave a squeal of delight shut up peeve please you will get u thrown out peeve cackled wandering around at midnight ickle firsties tut tut tut naughty naughty you will get caughty not if you do not give u away peeve please should tell filch i should said peeve in a sanity voice but his eye glittered wickedly it for your own good you know get out of the way snapped ron taking a swipe at peeve this wa a big mistake page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling student out of bed peeve bellowed student out of bed down the charm corridor ducking under peeve they ran for their life right to the end of the corridor where they slammed into a door and it wa locked this is it ron moaned a they pushed helplessly at the door were done for this is the end they could hear footstep filch running a fast a he could toward peeve s shout oh move over hermione snarled she grabbed harrys wand tapped the lock and whispered alohomora the lock clicked and the door swung open they piled through it shut it quickly and pressed their ear against it listening which way did they go peeve filch wa saying quick tell me say please do not mess with me peeve now where did they go shall not say nothing if you do not say please said peeve in his annoying singsong voice all right please nothing ha haaa told you i would not say nothing if you did not say please ha ha haaaaaa and they heard the sound of peeve whooshing away and filch cursing in rage page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he think this door is locked harry whispered i think well be okay get off neville for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harrys bathrobe for the last minute what harry turned around and saw quite clearly what for a moment he wa sure he would walked into a nightmare this wa too much on top of everything that had happened so far they were not in a room a he had supposed they were in a corridor the forbidden corridor on the third floor and now they knew why it wa forbidden they were looking straight into the eye of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor it had three head three pair of rolling mad eye three nose twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouth saliva hanging in slippery rope from yellowish fang it wa standing quite still all six eye staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they were not already dead wa that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it wa quickly getting over that there wa no mistaking what those thunderous growl meant harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death he would take filch they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they did not see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do wa put a much space a possible between them and that monster they did not stop running until they page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor where on earth have you all been she asked looking at their bathrobe hanging off their shoulder and their flushed sweaty face never mind that pig snout pig snout panted harry and the portrait swung forward they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchair it wa a while before any of them said anything neville indeed looked a if he would never speak again what do they think they are doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school said ron finally if any dog need exercise that one doe hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again you do not use your eye any of you do you she snapped did not you see what it wa standing on the floor harry suggested i wa not looking at it foot i wa too busy with it head no not the floor it wa standing on a trapdoor it obviously guarding something she stood up glaring at them i hope you are pleased with yourselves we could all have been killed or worse expelled now if you do not mind i am going to bed ron stared after her his mouth open page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling no we do not mind he said you would think we dragged her along would not you but hermione had given harry something else to think about a he climbed back into bed the dog wa guarding something what had hagrid said gringotts wa the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts it looked a though harry had found out where the grubby little package from vault seven hundred and thirteen wa page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling halloween malfoy could not believe his eye when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection it either really valuable or really dangerous said ron or both said harry but a all they knew for sure about the mysterious object wa that it wa about two inch long they did not have much chance of guessing what it wa without further clue page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor all neville cared about wa never going near the dog again hermione wa now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she wa such a bossy knowitall that they saw this a an added bonus all they really wanted now wa a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later a the owl flooded into the great hall a usual everyone is attention wa caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owl harry wa just a interested a everyone else to see what wa in this large parcel and wa amazed when the owl soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel harry ripped open the letter first which wa lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i do not want everybody knowing you have got a broomstick or they will all want one oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven of the clock for your first training session professor m mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee a he handed the note to ron to read page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling a nimbus two thousand ron moaned enviously i have never even touched one they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it that is a broomstick he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face you will be in for it this time potter first year are not allowed them ron could not resist it it not any old broomstick he said it a nimbus two thousand what did you say you have got at home malfoy a comet two sixty ron grinned at harry comet look flashy but they are not in the same league a the nimbus what would you know about it weasley you could not afford half the handle malfoy snapped back i suppose you and your brother have to save up twig by twig before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoys elbow not arguing i hope boy he squeaked potter been sent a broomstick professor said malfoy quickly yes yes that is right said professor flitwick beaming at harry professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstance potter and what model is it page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling a nimbus two thousand sir said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoys face and it really thanks to malfoy here that i have got it he added harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoys obvious rage and confusion well it true harry chortled a they reached the top of the marble staircase if he had not stolen nevilles remembrall i would not be on the team so i suppose you think that is a reward for breaking rule came an angry voice from just behind them hermione wa stomping up the stair looking disapprovingly at the package in harrys hand i thought you were not speaking to u said harry yes do not stop now said ron it doing u so much good hermione marched away with her nose in the air harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lesson that day it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick wa lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where he would be learning to play that night he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he wa eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last wow ron sighed a the broomstick rolled onto harrys bedspread even harry who knew nothing about the different broom thought it looked wonderful sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling neat straight twig and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top a seven of the clock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field he would never been inside the stadium before hundred of seat were raised in stand around the field so that the spectator were high enough to see what wa going on at either end of the field were three golden pole with hoop on the end they reminded harry of the little plastic stick muggle child blew bubble through except that they were fifty foot high too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal post and then sped up and down the field the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch hey potter come down oliver wood had arrived he wa carrying a large wooden crate under his arm harry landed next to him very nice said wood his eye glinting i see what mcgonagall meant you really are a natural i am just going to teach you the rule this evening then you will be joining team practice three time a week he opened the crate inside were four differentsized ball right said wood now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if it not too easy to play there are seven player on each side three of them are called chaser page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling three chaser harry repeated a wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball this ball called the quaffle said wood the chaser throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoop to score a goal ten point every time the quaffle go through one of the hoop follow me the chaser throw the quaffle and put it through the hoop to score harry recited so that is sort of like basketball on broomstick with six hoop is not it what is basketball said wood curiously never mind said harry quickly now there is another player on each side who is called the keeper i am keeper for gryffindor i have to fly around our hoop and stop the other team from scoring three chaser one keeper said harry who wa determined to remember it all and they play with the quaffle okay got that so what are they for he pointed at the three ball left inside the box ill show you now said wood take this he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat i am going to show you what the bludgers do wood said these two are the bludgers he showed harry two identical ball jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle harry noticed page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling that they seemed to be straining to escape the strap holding them inside the box stand back wood warned harry he bent down and freed one of the bludgers at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harrys face harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their head and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground see wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely the bludgers rocket around trying to knock player off their broom that is why you have two beater on each team the weasley twin are ours it their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team so think you have got all that three chaser try and score with the quaffle the keeper guard the goal post the beater keep the bludgers away from their team harry reeled off very good said wood er have the bludgers ever killed anyone harry asked hoping he sounded offhand never at hogwarts we have had a couple of broken jaw but nothing worse than that now the last member of the team is the seeker that is you and you do not have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling do not worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean they are like a pair of human bludgers themselves wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it wa tiny about the size of a large walnut it wa bright gold and had little fluttering silver wing this said wood is the golden snitch and it the most important ball of the lot it very hard to catch because it so fast and difficult to see it the seeker job to catch it you have got to weave in and out of the chaser beater bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team seeker because whichever seeker catch the snitch win his team an extra hundred and fifty point so they nearly always win that is why seeker get fouled so much a game of quidditch only end when the snitch is caught so it can go on for age i think the record is three month they had to keep bringing on substitute so the player could get some sleep well that is it any question harry shook his head he understood what he had to do all right it wa doing it that wa going to be the problem we will not practice with the snitch yet said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate it too dark we might lose it let u try you out with a few of these he pulled a bag of ordinary golf ball out of his pocket and a few minute later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf ball a hard a he could in every direction for harry to catch page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry did not miss a single one and wood wa delighted after half an hour night had really fallen and they could not carry on that quidditch cupll have our name on it this year said wood happily a they trudged back up to the castle i would not be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he had not gone off chasing dragon perhaps it wa because he wa now so busy what with quidditch practice three evening a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he would already been at hogwarts two month the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had his lesson too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basic on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridor even better professor flitwick announced in charm that he thought they were ready to start making object fly something they had all been dying to try since they would seen him make nevilles toad zoom around the classroom professor flitwick put the class into pair to practice harrys partner wa seamus finnigan which wa a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye ron however wa to be working with hermione granger it wa hard to tell whether ron or hermione wa angrier about this she had not spoken to either of them since the day harrys broomstick had arrived now do not forget that nice wrist movement we have been practicing squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of book a usual swish and flick remember swish and flick and saying the magic word properly is very important too never page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling forget wizard baruffio who said s instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest it wa very difficult harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat ron at the next table wa not having much more luck wingardium leviosal he shouted waving his long arm like a windmill you are saying it wrong harry heard hermione snap it winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and long you do it then if you are so clever ron snarled hermione rolled up the sleeve of her gown flicked her wand and said wingardium leviosav their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four foot above their head oh well done cried professor flitwick clapping everyone see here miss granger done it ron wa in a very bad mood by the end of the class it no wonder no one can stand her he said to harry a they pushed their way into the crowded corridor she is a nightmare honestly page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling someone knocked into harry a they hurried past him it wa hermione harry caught a glimpse of her face and wa startled to see that she wa in tear i think she heard you so said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable she must have noticed she is got no friend hermione did not turn up for the next class and wa not seen all afternoon on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione wa cry in the girl bathroom and wanted to be left alone ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decoration put hermione out of their mind a thousand live bat fluttered from the wall and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the table in low black cloud making the candle in the pumpkin stutter the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plate a it had at the startofterm banquet harry wa just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face everyone stared a he reached professor dumbledores chair slumped against the table and gasped troll in the dungeon thought you ought to know he then sank to the floor in a dead faint there wa an uproar it took several purple firecracker exploding from the end of professor dumbledores wand to bring silence page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling prefect he rumbled lead your house back to the dormitory immediately percy wa in his element follow me stick together first year no need to fear the troll if you follow my order stay close behind me now make way first year coming through excuse me i am a prefect how could a troll get in harry asked a they climbed the stair do not ask me they are supposed to be really stupid said ron maybe peeve let it in for a halloween joke they passed different group of people hurrying in different direction a they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed ron arm i have just thought hermione what about her she doe not know about the troll ron bit his lip oh all right he snapped but percyd better not see u ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girl bathroom they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footstep behind them page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling percy hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin peering around it however they saw not percy but snape he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view what is he doing harry whispered why is not he down in the dungeon with the rest of the teacher search me quietly a possible they crept along the next corridor after snape s fading footstep he heading for the third floor harry said but ron held up his hand can you smell something harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostril a mixture of old sock and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfall of gigantic foot ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge wa moving toward them they shrank into the shadow and watched a it emerged into a patch of moonlight it wa a horrible sight twelve foot tall it skin wa a dull granite gray it great lumpy body like a boulder with it small bald head perched on top like a coconut it had short leg thick a tree trunk with flat horny foot the smell coming from it wa incredible it wa holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because it arm were so long page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside it waggled it long ear making up it tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room the key in the lock harry muttered we could lock it in good idea said ron nervously they edged toward the open door mouth dry praying the troll wa not about to come out of it with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it yes flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but a they reached the corner they heard something that made their heart stop a high petrified scream and it wa coming from the chamber they would just chained up oh no said ron pale a the bloody baron it the girl bathroom harry gasped hermionel they said together it wa the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic harry pulled the door open and they ran inside hermione granger wa shrinking against the wall opposite looking a if she wa about to faint the troll wa advancing on her knocking the sink off the wall a it went page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling confuse it harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it a hard a he could against the wall the troll stopped a few foot from hermione it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise it mean little eye saw harry it hesitated then made for him instead lifting it club a it went oy peabrain yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it the troll did not even seem to notice the pipe hitting it shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning it ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it come on run run harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she could not move she wa still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror the shouting and the echo seemed to be driving the troll berserk it roared again and started toward ron who wa nearest and had no way to escape harry then did something that wa both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arm around the troll neck from behind the troll could not feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up it nose and harrys wand had still been in his hand when he would jumped it had gone straight up one of the troll nostril howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed it club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll wa going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he wa going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head wingardium leviosal the club flew suddenly out of the troll hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto it owner head the troll swayed on the spot and then fell flat on it face with a thud that made the whole room tremble harry got to his foot he wa shaking and out of breath ron wa standing there with his wand still raised staring at what he had done it wa hermione who spoke first is it dead i do not think so said harry i think it just been knocked out he bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll nose it wa covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue urgh troll booger he wiped it on the troll trouser a sudden slamming and loud footstep made the three of them look up they had not realized what a racket they had been making but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crash and the troll roar a moment later professor mcgonagall had come bursting into the room closely followed by snape with quirrell bringing up the rear quirrell page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling took one look at the troll let out a faint whimper and sat quickly down on a toilet clutching his heart snape bent over the troll professor mcgonagall wa looking at ron and harry harry had never seen her look so angry her lip were white hope of winning fifty point for gryffindor faded quickly from harrys mind what on earth were you thinking of said professor mcgonagall with cold fury in her voice harry looked at ron who wa still standing with his wand in the air you are lucky you were not killed why are not you in your dormitory snape gave harry a swift piercing look harry looked at the floor he wished ron would put his wand down then a small voice came out of the shadow please professor mcgonagall they were looking for me miss granger hermione had managed to get to her foot at last i went looking for the troll because i i thought i could deal with it on my own you know because i have read all about them ron dropped his wand hermione granger telling a downright lie to a teacher if they had not found me id be dead now harry stuck his wand up it nose and ron knocked it out with it own club they did not have time to come and fetch anyone it wa about to finish me off when they arrived page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry and ron tried to look a though this story wa not new to them well in that case said professor mcgonagall staring at the three of them miss granger you foolish girl how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own hermione hung her head harry wa speechless hermione wa the last person to do anything against the rule and here she wa pretending she had to get them out of trouble it wa a if snape had started handing out sweet miss granger five point will be taken from gryffindor for this said professor mcgonagall i am very disappointed in you if you are not hurt at all you would better get off to gryffindor tower student are finishing the feast in their house hermione left professor mcgonagall turned to harry and ron well i still say you were lucky but not many first year could have taken on a fullgrown mountain troll you each win gryffindor five point professor dumbledore will be informed of this you may go they hurried out of the chamber and did not speak at all until they had climbed two floor up it wa a relief to be away from the smell of the troll quite apart from anything else we should have gotten more than ten point ron grumbled five you mean once she is taken off hermione s page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling good of her to get u out of trouble like that ron admitted mind you we did save her she might not have needed saving if we had not locked the thing in with her harry reminded him they had reached the portrait of the fat lady pig snout they said and entered the common room wa packed and noisy everyone wa eating the food that had been sent up hermione however stood alone by the door waiting for them there wa a very embarrassed pause then none of them looking at each other they all said thanks and hurried off to get plate but from that moment on hermione granger became their friend there are some thing you can not share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling quidditch a they entered november the weather turned very cold the mountain around the school became icy gray and the lake like chilled steel every morning the ground wa covered in frost hagrid could be seen from the upstairs window defrosting broomstick on the quidditch field bundled up in a long moleskin overcoat rabbit fur glove and enormous beaverskin boot the quidditch season had begun on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after week of training gryffindor versus slytherin if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that a their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret but the news that he wa playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry did not know which wa worse people telling him he would be brilliant or people telling him they would be running around underneath him holding a mattress page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling it wa really lucky that harry now had hermione a a friend he did not know how he would have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the last minute quidditch practice wood wa making them do she had also lent him quidditch through the age which turned out to be a very interesting read harry learned that there were seven hundred way of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in that seeker were usually the smallest and fastest player and that most serious quidditch accident seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referee had been known to vanish and turn up month later in the sahara desert hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rule since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she wa much nicer for it the day before harrys first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar they were standing with their back to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard harry noticed at once that snape wa limping harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it would not be allowed unfortunately something about their guilty face caught snapes eye he limped over he had not seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway what is that you have got there potter it wa quidditch through the age harry showed him page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling library book are not to be taken outside the school said snape give it to me five point from gryffindor he just made that rule up harry muttered angrily a snape limped away wonder what is wrong with his leg do not know but i hope it really hurting him said ron bitterly the gryffindor common room wa very noisy that evening harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window hermione wa checking harry and ron charm homework for them she would never let them copy how will you learn but by asking her to read it through they got the right answer anyway harry felt restless he wanted quidditch through the age back to take his mind off his nerve about tomorrow why should he be afraid of snape getting up he told ron and hermione he wa going to ask snape if he could have it better you than me they said together but harry had an idea that snape would not refuse if there were other teacher listening he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked there wa no answer he knocked again nothing perhaps snape had left the book in there it wa worth a try he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eye snape and filch were inside alone snape wa holding his robe above his knee one of his leg wa bloody and mangled filch wa handing snape bandage page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling blasted thing snape wa saying how are you supposed to keep your eye on all three head at once harry tried to shut the door quietly but potter snape s face wa twisted with fury a he dropped his robe quickly to hide his leg harry gulped i just wondered if i could have my book back get out out harry left before snape could take any more point from gryffindor he sprinted back upstairs did you get it ron asked a harry joined them what is the matter in a low whisper harry told them what he would seen you know what this mean he finished breathlessly he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween that is where he wa going when we saw him he after whatever it guarding and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion hermiones eye were wide no he would not she said i know he not very nice but he would not try and steal something dumbledore wa keeping safe honestly hermione you think all teacher are saint or something snapped ron i am with harry i page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling would not put anything past snape but what is he after what is that dog guarding harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question neville wa snoring loudly but harry could not sleep he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hour but the expression on snapes face when harry had seen his leg wa not easy to forget the next morning dawned very bright and cold the great hall wa full of the delicious smell of fried sausage and the cheerful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match you have got to eat some breakfast i do not want anything just a bit of toast wheedled hermione i am not hungry harry felt terrible in an hour time he would be walking onto the field harry you need your strength said seamus finnigan seeker are always the one who get clobbered by the other team thanks seamus said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausage by eleven of the clock the whole school seemed to be out in the stand around the quidditch pitch many student had binoculars the seat might be raised high in the air but it wa still difficult to see what wa going on sometimes page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row a a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheet scabbers had ruined it said potter for president and dean who wa good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different color meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robe slytherin would be playing in green wood cleared his throat for silence okay men he said and woman said chaser angelina johnson and woman wood agreed this is it the big one said fred weasley the one we have all been waiting for said george we know oliver speech by heart fred told harry we were on the team last year shut up you two said wood this is the best team gryffindors had in year were going to win i know it he glared at them all a if to say or else right it time good luck all of you harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knee were not going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheer page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling madam hooch wa refereeing she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two team her broom in her hand now i want a nice fair game all of you she said once they were all gathered around her harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a fifth year harry thought flint looked a if he had some troll blood in him out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd his heart skipped he felt braver mount your broom please harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle fifteen broom rose up high high into the air they were off and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too jordan sorry professor the weasley twin friend lee jordan wa doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall and she is really belting along up there a neat pas to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver wood last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gain the quaffle and off he go flint page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling flying like an eagle up there he going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle that is chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and ouch that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger quaffle taken by the slytherins that is adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal post but he blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley can not tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she go she is really flying dodge a speeding bludger the goal post are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dive miss gryffindors score gryffindor cheer filled the cold air with howl and moan from the slytherins budge up there move along hagrid ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them bin watchin from me hut said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck but it is not the same a bein in the crowd no sign of the snitch yet eh nope said ron harry ha not had much to do yet kept outta trouble though that is somethin said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that wa harry page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling way up above them harry wa gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch this wa part of his and wood game plan keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch wood had said we do not want you attacked before you have to be when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feeling now he wa back to staring around for the snitch once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it wa just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatch and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it all right there harry he had time to yell a he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint slytherin in possession lee jordan wa saying chaser pucey duck two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speed toward the wait a moment wa that the snitch a murmur ran through the crowd a adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear harry saw it in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chaser seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing a they hung in midair to watch page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry wa faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wing fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harrys broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life foul screamed the gryffindors madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal post for gryffindor but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again down in the stand dean thomas wa yelling send him off ref red card what are you talking about dean said ron red card said dean furiously in soccer you get shown the red card and you are out of the game but this is not soccer dean ron reminded him hagrid however wa on dean side they oughta change the rule flint coulda knocked harry outta the air lee jordan wa finding it difficult not to take side so after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating jordan growled professor mcgonagall i mean after that open and revolting foul page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling jordan i am warning you all right all right flint nearly kill the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone i am sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinnet who put it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession it wa a harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch for a split second he thought he wa going to fall he gripped the broom tightly with both his hand and knee he would never felt anything like that it happened again it wa a though the broom wa trying to buck him off but nimbus two thousand did not suddenly decide to buck their rider off harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal post he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout and then he realized that his broom wa completely out of his control he could not turn it he could not direct it at all it wa zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movement that almost unseated him lee wa still commentating slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle pass spinnet pass bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score oh no the slytherins were cheering no one seemed to have noticed that harrys broom wa behaving strangely it wa carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching a it went page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling do not know what harry think he doing hagrid mumbled he stared through his binoculars if i didn know better id say he would lost control of his broom but he can not have suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stand his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on then the whole crowd gasped harrys broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it he wa now dangling from it holding on with only one hand did something happen to it when flint blocked him seamus whispered can not have hagrid said his voice shaking can not nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand at these word hermione seized hagrid s binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd what are you doing moaned ron grayfaced i knew it hermione gasped snape look ron grabbed the binoculars snape wa in the middle of the stand opposite them he had his eye fixed on harry and wa muttering nonstop under his breath he doing something jinxing the broom said hermione what should we do leave it to me page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared ron turned the binoculars back on harry his broom wa vibrating so hard it wa almost impossible for him to hang on much longer the whole crowd wa on it foot watching terrified a the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their broom but it wa no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five time without anyone noticing come on hermione ron muttered desperately hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and wa now racing along the row behind him she did not even stop to say sorry a she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few wellchosen word bright blue flame shot from her wand onto the hem of snape s robe it took perhaps thirty second for snape to realize that he wa on fire a sudden yelp told her she had done her job scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened it wa enough up in the air harry wa suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom neville you can look ron said neville had been sobbing into hagrids jacket for the last five minute harry wa speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth a though page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he wa about to be sick he hit the field on all four coughed and something gold fell into his hand i have got the snitch he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion he did not catch it he nearly swallowed it flint wa still howling twenty minute later but it made no difference harry had not broken any rule and lee jordan wa still happily shouting the result gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy point to sixty harry heard none of this though he wa being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrids hut with ron and hermione it wa snape ron wa explaining hermione and i saw him he wa cursing your broomstick muttering he would not take his eye off you rubbish said hagrid who had not heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stand why would snape do somethin like that harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him harry decided on the truth i found out something about him he told hagrid he tried to get past that threeheaded dog on halloween it bit him we think he wa trying to steal whatever it guarding hagrid dropped the teapot how do you know about fluffy he said fluffy page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling yeah he mine bought him off a greek chappie i met in the pub la year i lent him to dumbledore to guard the yes said harry eagerly now do not ask me anymore said hagrid gruffly that is top secret that is but snapes trying to steal it rubbish said hagrid again snapes a hogwarts teacher he would do nothin of the sort so why did he just try and kill harry cried hermione the afternoon event certainly seemed to have changed her mind about snape i know a jinx when i see one hagrid i have read all about them you have got to keep eye contact and snape wa not blinking at all i saw him i am tellin yeh yer wrong said hagrid hotly i don know why harrys broom acted like that but snape wouldn try an kill a student now listen to me all three of yeh yer meddlin in thing that don concern yeh it dangerous you forget that dog an you forget what it guardin that is between professor dumbledore an nicolas flamel aha said harry so there is someone called nicolas flamel involved is there hagrid looked furious with himself page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the mirror of erised christmas wa coming one morning in mid december hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several foot of snow the lake froze solid and the weasley twin were punished for bewitching several snowball so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban the few owl that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again no one could wait for the holiday to start while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fire the drafty corridor had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the window in the classroom worst of all were professor snapes class down in the dungeon where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept a close a possible to their hot cauldron i do feel so sorry said draco malfoy one potion class for all those people who have to stay at page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hogwarts for christmas because they are not wanted at home he wa looking over at harry a he spoke crabbe and goyle chuckled harry who wa measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry a seeker next then he would realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family it wa true that harry wa not going back to privet drive for christmas professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of student who would be staying for the holiday and harry had signed up at once he did not feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas he would ever had ron and his brother were staying too because mr and mr weasley were going to romania to visit charlie when they left the dungeon at the end of potion they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead two enormous foot sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid wa behind it hi hagrid want any help ron asked sticking his head through the branch nah i am all right thanks ron page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling would you mind moving out of the way came malfoys cold drawl from behind them are you trying to earn some extra money weasley hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrids must seem like a palace compared to what your family used to ron dived at malfoy just a snape came up the stair weasley ron let go of the front of malfoys robe he wa provoked professor snape said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree malfoy wa insultin his family be that a it may fighting is against hogwarts rule hagrid said snape silkily five point from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it is not more move along all of you malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needle everywhere and smirking ill get him said ron grinding his teeth at malfoys back one of these day ill get him i hate them both said harry malfoy and snape come on cheer up it nearly christmas said hagrid tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall look a treat so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decoration page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you the hall looked spectacular festoon of holly and mistletoe hung all around the wall and no le than twelve towering christmas tree stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicle some glittering with hundred of candle how many day you got left until yer holiday hagrid asked just one said hermione and that reminds me harry ron we have got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library oh yeah you are right said ron tearing his eye away from professor flitwick who had golden bubble blossoming out of his wand and wa trailing them over the branch of the new tree the library said hagrid following them out of the hall just before the holiday bit keen are not yeh oh were not working harry told him brightly ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we have been trying to find out who he is you what hagrid looked shocked listen here i have told yeh drop it it nothin to you what that dog guardin we just want to know who nicolas flamel is that is all said hermione unless you would like to tell u and save u the trouble harry added we must have been through hundred of book already and we can not find him anywhere just page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling give u a hint i know i have read his name somewhere i am sayin nothin said hagrid flatly just have to find out for ourselves then said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library they had indeed been searching book for flamels name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape wa trying to steal the trouble wa it wa very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book he wa not in great wizard of the twentieth century or notable magical name of our time he wa missing too from important modern magical discovery and a study of recent development in wizardry and then of course there wa the sheer size of the library ten of thousand of book thousand of shelf hundred of narrow row hermione took out a list of subject and title she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of book and started pulling them off the shelf at random harry wandered over to the restricted section he had been wondering for a while if flamel wa not somewhere in there unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teacher to look in any of the restricted book and he knew he would never get one these were the book containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older student studying advanced defense against the dark art what are you looking for boy nothing said harry page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him you would better get out then go on out wishing he would been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library he ron and hermione had already agreed they would better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel they were sure she would be able to tell them but they could not risk snape hearing what they were up to harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he wa not very hopeful they had been looking for two week after all but a they only had odd moment between lesson it wa not surprising they would found nothing what they really needed wa a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their neck five minute later ron and hermione joined him shaking their head they went off to lunch you will keep looking while i am away will not you said hermione and send me an owl if you find anything and you could ask your parent if they know who flamel is said ron it would be safe to ask them very safe a they are both dentist said hermione once the holiday had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room wa far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchair by the fire they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffin page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling marshmallow and plotting way of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they would not work ron also started teaching harry wizard chess this wa exactly like muggle chess except that the figure were alive which made it a lot like directing troop in battle ron set wa very old and battered like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather however old chessman were not a drawback at all ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted harry played with chessman seamus finnigan had lent him and they did not trust him at all he wa not a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bit of advice at him which wa confusing do not send me there can not you see his knight send him we can afford to lose him on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any present at all when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw wa a small pile of package at the foot of his bed merry christmas said ron sleepily a harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe you too said harry will you look at this i have got some present what did you expect turnip said ron turning to his own pile which wa a lot bigger than harrys harry picked up the top parcel it wa wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it wa to harry from hagrid inside wa a roughly cut wooden page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling flute hagrid had obviously whittled it himself harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl a second very small parcel contained a note we received your message and enclose your christmas present from uncle vernon and aunt petunia taped to the note wa a fiftypence piece that is friendly said harry ron wa fascinated by the fifty penny weird he said what a shape this is money you can keep it said harry laughing at how pleased ron wa hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these i think i know who that one from said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel my mom i told her you did not expect any present and oh no he groaned she is made you a weasley sweater harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick hand knitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge every year she make u a sweater said ron unwrapping his own and mine always maroon that is really nice of her said harry trying the fudge which wa very tasty his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frog from hermione page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling this only left one parcel harry picked it up and felt it it wa very light he unwrapped it something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming fold ron gasped i have heard of those he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor bean he would gotten from hermione if that is what i think it is they are really rare and really valuable what is it harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor it wa strange to the touch like water woven into material it an invisibility cloak said ron a look of awe on his face i am sure it is try it on harry threw the cloak around his shoulder and ron gave a yell it is look down harry looked down at his foot but they were gone he dashed to the mirror sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely there is a note said ron suddenly a note fell out of it harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following word page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling your father left this in my possession before he died it is time it wa returned to you use it well a very merry christmas to you there wa no signature harry stared at the note ron wa admiring the cloak id give anuthinq for one of these he said anuthinq what is the matter nothing said harry he felt very strange who had sent the cloak had it really once belonged to his father before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door wa flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight he did not feel like sharing it with anyone else yet merry christmas hey look harrys got a weasley sweater too fred and george were wearing blue sweater one with a large yellow f on it the other a g harrys is better than ours though said fred holding up harrys sweater she obviously make more of an effort if you are not family why are not you wearing yours ron george demanded come on get it on they are lovely and warm page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i hate maroon ron moaned halfheartedly a he pulled it over his head you have not got a letter on yours george observed i suppose she think you do not forget your name but were not stupid we know were called gred and forge what is all this noise percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his present a he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized p for prefect get it on percy come on were all wearing ours even harry got one i do not want said percy thickly a the twin forced the sweater over his head knocking his glass askew and you are not sitting with the prefect today either said george christmas is a time for family they frogmarched percy from the room his arm pinned to his side by his sweater harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner a hundred fat roast turkey mountain of roast and boiled potato platter of chipolata tureen of buttered pea silver boat of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stack of wizard cracker every few foot along the table these fantastic party favor were nothing like the feeble muggle one the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toy and their flimsy paper hat inside harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it did not just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admiral hat and several live white mouse up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard hat for a flowered bonnet and wa chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him flaming christmas pudding followed the turkey percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face a he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harrys amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided when harry finally left the table he wa laden down with a stack of thing out of the cracker including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloon a grow yourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess set the white mouse had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up a mr norris christmas dinner harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the ground then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron he suspected he would not have lost so badly if percy had not tried to help him so much after a meal of turkey sandwich crumpet trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they would stolen his prefect badge it had been harrys best christmas day ever yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling all day not until he climbed into bed wa he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost a soon a he would drawn the curtain of his fourposter harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it his father this had been his father he let the material flow over his hand smoother than silk light a air use it well the note had said he had to try it now he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself looking down at his leg he saw only moonlight and shadow it wa a very funny feeling use it well suddenly harry felt wideawake the whole of hogwarts wa open to him in this cloak excitement flooded through him a he stood there in the dark and silence he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know ron grunted in his sleep should harry wake him something held him back his father cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone he crept out of the dormitory down the stair across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole who is there squawked the fat lady harry said nothing he walked quickly down the corridor page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling where should he go he stopped his heart racing and thought and then it came to him the restricted section in the library he would be able to read a long a he liked a long a it took to find out who flamel wa he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him a he walked the library wa pitchblack and very eerie harry lit a lamp to see his way along the row of book the lamp looked a if it wa floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creep the restricted section wa right at the back of the library stepping carefully over the rope that separated these book from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the title they did not tell him much their peeling faded gold letter spelled word in language harry could not understand some had no title at all one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood the hair on the back of harrys neck prickled maybe he wa imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering wa coming from the book a though they knew someone wa there who should not be he had to start somewhere setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book a large black and silver volume caught his eye he pulled it out with difficulty because it wa very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book wa screaming harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once panicking he page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling heard footstep coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it he passed filch in the doorway filchs pale wild eye looked straight through him and harry slipped under filchs outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the book shriek still ringing in his ear he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor he had been so busy getting away from the library he had not paid attention to where he wa going perhaps because it wa dark he did not recognize where he wa at all there wa a suit of armor near the kitchen he knew but he must be five floor above there you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone wa wandering around at night and somebody is been in the library restricted section harry felt the blood drain out of his face wherever he wa filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice wa getting nearer and to his horror it wa snape who replied the restricted section well they can not be far well catch them harry stood rooted to the spot a filch and snape came around the corner ahead they could not see him of course but it wa a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they would knock right into him the cloak did not stop him from being solid he backed away a quietly a he could a door stood ajar to his left it wa his only hope he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footstep dying away that page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling had been close very close it wa a few second before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in it looked like an unused classroom the dark shape of desk and chair were piled against the wall and there wa an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him wa something that did not look a if it belonged there something that looked a if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way it wa a magnificent mirror a high a the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed foot there wa an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi his panic fading now that there wa no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again he stepped in front of it he had to clap his hand to his mouth to stop himself from screaming he whirled around his heart wa pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him but the room wa empty breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror there he wa reflected in it white and scared looking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others harry looked over his shoulder but still no one wa there or were they all invisible too wa he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror trick wa that it reflected them invisible or not page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling he looked in the mirror again a woman standing right behind his reflection wa smiling at him and waving he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him if she wa really there he would touch her their reflection were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror she wa a very pretty woman she had dark red hair and her eye her eye are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she wa cry smiling but cry at the same time the tall thin blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her he wore glass and his hair wa very untidy it stuck up at the back just a harrys did harry wa so close to the mirror now that his nose wa nearly touching that of his reflection mom he whispered dad they just looked at him smiling and slowly harry looked into the face of the other people in the mirror and saw other pair of green eye like his other nose like his even a little old man who looked a though he had harrys knobbly knee harry wa looking at his family for the first time in his life the potter smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hand pressed flat against the glass a though he wa hoping to fall right through it and reach them he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness how long he stood there he did not know the reflection did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his sens he could not stay here he had to find his way back to page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling bed he tore his eye away from his mother face whispered ill come back and hurried from the room you could have woken me up said ron crossly you can come tonight i am going back i want to show you the mirror id like to see your mom and dad ron said eagerly and i want to see all your family all the weasleys you will be able to show me your other brother and everyone you can see them any old time said ron just come round my house this summer anyway maybe it only show dead people shame about not finding flamel though have some bacon or something why are not you eating anything harry could not eat he had seen his parent and would be seeing them again tonight he had almost forgotten about flamel it did not seem very important anymore who cared what the threeheaded dog wa guarding what did it matter if snape stole it really are you all right said ron you look odd what harry feared most wa that he might not be able to find the mirror room again with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night they tried retracing harrys route from the library wandering around the dark passageway for nearly an hour i am freezing said ron let u forget it and go back ivo harry hissed i know it here somewhere page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else just a ron started moaning that his foot were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor it here just here yes they pushed the door open harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulder and ran to the mirror there they were his mother and father beamed at the sight of him see harry whispered i can not see anything look look at them all there are load of them i can only see you look in it properly go on stand where i am harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he could not see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajama ron though wa staring transfixed at his image look at me he said can you see all your family standing around you no i am alone but i am different i look older and i am head boy what page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i am i am wearing the badge like bill used to and i am holding the house cup and the quidditch cup i am quidditch captain too ron tore his eye away from this splendid sight to look excitedly at harry do you think this mirror show the future how can it all my family are dead let me have another look you had it to yourself all last night give me a bit more time you are only holding the quidditch cup what is interesting about that i want to see my parent do not push me a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion they had not realized how loudly they had been talking quick ron threw the cloak back over them a the luminous eye of mr norris came round the door ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cat after what seemed an age she turned and left this is not safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard u come on and ron pulled harry out of the room the snow still had not melted the next morning page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling want to play chess harry said ron no why do not we go down and visit hagrid no you go i know what you are thinking about harry that mirror do not go back tonight why not i do not know i have just got a bad feeling about it and anyway you have had too many close shave already filch snape and mr norris are wandering around so what if they can not see you what if they walk into you what if you knock something over you sound like hermione i am serious harry do not go but harry only had one thought in his head which wa to get back in front of the mirror and ron wa not going to stop him that third night he found his way more quickly than before he wa walking so fast he knew he wa making more noise than wa wise but he did not meet anyone and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfather nodding happily harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror there wa nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family nothing at all except page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling so back again harry harry felt a though his inside had turned to ice he looked behind him sitting on one of the desk by the wall wa none other than albus dumbledore harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he had not noticed him i i did not see you sir strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you said dumbledore and harry wa relieved to see that he wa smiling so said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry you like hundred before you have discovered the delight of the mirror of erised i did not know it wa called that sir but i expect you have realized by now what it doe it well it show me my family and it showed your friend ron himself a head boy how did you know i do not need a cloak to become invisible said dumbledore gently now can you think what the mirror of erised show u all harry shook his head let me explain the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly a he is doe that help page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry thought then he said slowly it show u what we want whatever we want yes and no said dumbledore quietly it show u nothing more or le than the deepest most desperate desire of our heart you who have never known your family see them standing around you ronald weasley who ha always been overshadowed by his brother see himself standing alone the best of all of them however this mirror will give u neither knowledge or truth men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it show is real or even possible the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared it doe not do to dwell on dream and forget to live remember that now why do not you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed harry stood up sir professor dumbledore can i ask you something obviously you have just done so dumbledore smiled you may ask me one more thing however what do you see when you look in the mirror i i see myself holding a pair of thick woolen sock harry stared one can never have enough sock said dumbledore another christmas ha come and gone page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling and i did not get a single pair people will insist on giving me book it wa only when he wa back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful but then he thought a he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling nicholas flambl dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holiday the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk harry wished he could forget what he would seen in the mirror a easily but he could not he started having nightmare over and over again he dreamed about his parent disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter you see dumbledore wa right that mirror could drive you mad said ron when harry told him about these dream hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of thing she wa torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three night in a row if filch had caught you and disappointment that he had not at least found out who nicolas flamel wa page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a library book even though harry wa still sure he would read the name somewhere once term had started they were back to skimming through book for ten minute during their break harry had even le time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again wood wa working the team harder than ever even the endless rain that had replaced the snow could not dampen his spirit the weasleys complained that wood wa becoming a fanatic but harry wa on wood side if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven year quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmare when he wa tired out after training then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news he would just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their broom will you stop messing around he yelled that is exactly the sort of thing that will lose u the match snapes refereeing this time and hell be looking for any excuse to knock point off gryffindor george weasley really did fall off his broom at these word snapes refereeing he spluttered through a mouthful of mud when is he ever refereed a quidditch match he not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too it not my fault said wood we have just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape ha not got an excuse to pick on u which wa all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he wa playing quidditch the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another a usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess chess wa the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought wa very good for her do not talk to me for a moment said ron when harry sat down next to him i need to concern he caught sight of harrys face what is the matter with you you look terrible speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about snape s sudden sinister desire to be a quidditch referee do not play said hermione at once say you are ill said ron pretend to break your leg hermione suggested really break your leg said ron i can not said harry there is not a reserve seeker if i back out gryffindor can not play at all page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling at that moment neville toppled into the common room how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole wa anyones guess because his leg had been stuck together with what they recognized at once a the leglocker curse he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse nevilles leg sprang apart and he got to his foot trembling what happened hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron malfoy said neville shakily i met him outside the library he said he would been looking for someone to practice that on go to professor mcgonagall hermione urged neville report him neville shook his head i do not want more trouble he mumbled you have got to stand up to him neville said ron he used to walking all over people but that is no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier there is no need to tell me i am not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoys already done that neville choked out harry felt in the pocket of his robe and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas he gave it to neville who looked a though he might cry page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you are worth twelve of malfoy harry said the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor did not it and where is malfoy in stinking slytherin nevilles lip twitched in a weak smile a he unwrapped the frog thanks harry i think ill go to bed dyou want the card you collect them do not you a neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card dumbledore again he said he wa the first one i ever he gasped he stared at the back of the card then he looked up at ron and hermione i have found him he whispered i have found flamel i told you id read the name somewhere before i read it on the train coming here listen to this dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard grindelwald in for the discovery of the twelve us of dragon blood and his work on alchemy with his partner nicolas flamelv hermione jumped to her foot she had not looked so excited since they would gotten back the mark for their very first piece of homework stay there she said and she sprinted up the stair to the girl dormitory harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified look before she wa dashing back an enormous old book in her arm i never thought to look in here she whispered excitedly i got this out of the library week ago for a bit of light reading page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling light said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until she would looked something up and started flicking frantically through the page muttering to herself at last she found what she wa looking for i knew it i knew it are we allowed to speak yet said ron grumpily hermione ignored him nicolas flamel she whispered dramatically is the only known maker of the sorcerer stone this did not have quite the effect she would expected the what said harry and ron oh honestly do not you two read look read that there she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer stone a legendary substance with astonishing power the stone will transform any metal into pure gold it also produce the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal there have been many report of the sorcerer stone over the century but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover mr flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling see said hermione when harry and ron had finished the dog must be guarding flamels sorcerer stone i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they are friend and he knew someone wa after it that is why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts a stone that make gold and stop you from ever dying said harry no wonder snapes after it anyone would want it and no wonder we could not find flamel in that study of recent development in wizardry said ron he not exactly recent if he six hundred and sixtyfive is he the next morning in defense against the dark art while copying down different way of treating werewolf bite harry and ron were still discussing what they would do with a sorcerer stone if they had one it wa not until ron said he would buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match i am going to play he told ron and hermione if i do not all the slytherins will think i am just too scared to face snape ill show them it will really wipe the smile off their face if we win just a long a were not wiping you off the field said hermione a the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione the rest of the team wa not too calm either the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship wa wonderful no one had done it for seven year but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry did not know whether he wa imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went at time he even wondered whether snape wa following him trying to catch him on his own potion lesson were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape wa so horrible to harry could snape possibly know they would found out about the sorcerer stone harry did not see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read mind harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker room the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether they would ever see him alive again this wa not what you would call comforting harry hardly heard a word of wood pep talk a he pulled on his quidditch robe and picked up his nimbus two thousand ron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stand next to neville who could not understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wand to the match little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse they would gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry now do not forget it locomotor mortis hermione muttered a ron slipped his wand up his sleeve i know ron snapped do not nag back in the locker room wood had taken harry aside do not want to pressure you potter but if we ever need an early capture of the snitch it now finish page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the game before snape can favor hufflepuff too much the whole school out there said fred weasley peering out of the door even blimey dumbledores come to watch harrys heart did a somersault dumbledore he said dashing to the door to make sure fred wa right there wa no mistaking that silver beard harry could have laughed out loud with relief he wa safe there wa simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore wa watching perhaps that wa why snape wa looking so angry a the team marched onto the field something that ron noticed too i have never seen snape look so mean he told hermione look they are off ouch someone had poked ron in the back of the head it wa malfoy oh sorry weasley did not see you there malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle wonder how long potter going to stay on his broom this time anyone want a bet what about you weasley ron did not answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him hermione who had all her finger crossed in her lap wa squinting fixedly at harry page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling who wa circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team said malfoy loudly a few minute later a snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all it people they feel sorry for see there is potter who is got no parent then there is the weasleys who have got no money you should be on the team longbottom you have got no brain neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy i am worth twelve of you malfoy he stammered malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eye from the game said you tell him neville longbottom if brain were gold you would be poorer than weasley and that is saying something ron nerve were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry i am warning you malfoy one more word ron said hermione suddenly harry what where harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasp and cheer from the crowd hermione stood up her crossed finger in her mouth a harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet you are in luck weasley potter obviously spotted some money on the ground said malfoy page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling ron snapped before malfoy knew what wa happening ron wa on top of him wrestling him to the ground neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help come on harry hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch a harry sped straight at snape she did not even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffle and yelp coming from the whirl of fist that wa neville crabbe and goyle up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inch the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand the stand erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly ron ron where are you the game over harrys won we have won gryffindor is in the lead shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground he could not believe it he would done it the game wa over it had barely lasted five minute a gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledores smiling face well done said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear nice to see you have not been brooding about that mirror been keeping busy excellent page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling snape spat bitterly on the ground jc jc jc harry left the locker room alone some time later to take his nimbus two thousand back to the broomshed he could not ever remember feeling happier he would really done something to be proud of now no one could say he wa just a famous name any more the evening air had never smelled so sweet he walked over the damp grass reliving the last hour in his head which wa a happy blur gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulder ron and hermione in the distance jumping up and down ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed harry had reached the she would he leaned against the wooden door and looked up at hogwarts with it window glowing red in the setting sun gryffindor in the lead he would done it he would shown snape and speaking of snape a hooded figure came swiftly down the front step of the castle clearly not wanting to be seen it walked a fast a possible toward the forbidden forest harrys victory faded from his mind a he watched he recognized the figure prowling walk snape sneaking into the forest while everyone else wa at dinner what wa going on harry jumped back on his nimbus two thousand and took off gliding silently over the castle he saw snape enter the forest at a run he followed the tree were so thick he could not see where snape had gone he flew in circle lower and lower brushing the top branch of tree until he heard page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling voice he glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree he climbed carefully along one of the branch holding tight to his broomstick trying to see through the leaf below in a shadowy clearing stood snape but he wa not alone quirrell wa there too harry could not make out the look on his face but he wa stuttering worse than ever harry strained to catch what they were saying ddont know why you wanted ttto meet here of all pplaces severus oh i thought wed keep this private said snape his voice icy student are not supposed to know about the sorcerer stone after all harry leaned forward quirrell wa mumbling something snape interrupted him have you found out how to get past that beast of hagrids yet bbbut severus i you do not want me a your enemy quirrell said snape taking a step toward him ii do not know what you you know perfectly well what i mean an owl hooted loudly and harry nearly fell out of the tree he steadied himself in time to hear snape say your little bit of hocuspocus i am waiting page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling bbut i dddont very well snape cut in well have another little chat soon when you have had time to think thing over and decided where your loyalty lie he threw his cloak over his head and strode out of the clearing it wa almost dark now but harry could see quirrell standing quite still a though he wa petrified jc jc jc harry where have you been hermione squeaked we won you won we won shouted ron thumping harry on the back and i gave malfoy a black eye and neville tried to take on crabbe and goyle single handed he still out cold but madam pomfrey say hell be all right talk about showing slytherin everyone is waiting for you in the common room were having a party fred and george stole some cake and stuff from the kitchen never mind that now said harry breathlessly let u find an empty room you wait til you hear this he made sure peeve wa not inside before shutting the door behind them then he told them what he would seen and heard so we were right it is the sorcerer stone and snapes trying to force quirrell to help him get it he asked if he knew how to get past fluffy and he said something about quirrells hocuspocus i reckon there are other thing guarding the stone apart from fluffy load of enchantment probably and quirrell page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling would have done some antidark art spell that snape need to break through so you mean the stone only safe a long a quirrell stand up to snape said hermione in alarm it will be gone by next tuesday said ron page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling norbert the norwegian ridgeback quirrell however must have been braver than they would thought in the week that followed he did seem to be getting paler and thinner but it did not look a though he would cracked yet every time they passed the thirdfloor corridor harry ron and hermione would press their ear to the door to check that fluffy wa still growling inside snape wa sweeping about in his usual bad temper which surely meant that the stone wa still safe whenever harry passed quirrell these day he gave him an encouraging sort of smile and ron had started telling people off for laughing at quirrells stutter hermione however had more on her mind than the sorcerer stone she had started drawing up study schedule and colorcoding all her note harry and ron would not have minded but she kept nagging them to do the same page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hermione the exam are age away ten week hermione snapped that is not age that is like a second to nicolas flamel but were not six hundred year old ron reminded her anyway what are you studying for you already know it all what am i studying for are you crazy you

to be thinking along the same line a hermione they piled so much homework on them that the easter holiday were not nearly a much fun a the christmas one it wa hard to relax with hermione next to you reciting the twelve us of dragon blood or practicing wand movement moaning and yawning harry and ron spent most of their free time in the library with her trying to get through all their extra work ill never remember this ron burst out one afternoon throwing down his quill and looking longingly out of the library window it wa the first really fine day they would had in month the sky wa a clear forgetmenot blue and there wa a feeling in the air of summer coming harry who wa looking up dittany in one thousand magical herb and fungi did not look up until he heard ron say hagrid what are you doing in the library page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hagrid shuffled into view hiding something behind his back he looked very out of place in his moleskin overcoat jus lookin

in his arm and slammed them down on the table page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling dragon he whispered hagrid wa looking up stuff about dragon look at these dragon specie of great britain and ireland from egg to inferno a dragon keeper guide hagrid s always wanted a dragon he told me so the first time i ever met him said harry but it against our law said ron dragon breeding wa

hushing them up i can tell you our kind have to keep putting spell on muggles who have spotted them to make them forget so what on earth hagrid up to said hermione when they knocked on the door of the gamekeeper hut an hour later they were surprised to see that all the curtain were closed hagrid called who is it before he let them in and then shut the door quickly behind them it wa stifling hot inside even though it wa such a warm day there wa a blazing fire in the grate hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwich which they refused so yeh wanted to ask me somethin page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling yes said harry there wa no point beating around the bush we were wondering if you could tell u what is guarding the sorcerer stone apart from fluffy hagrid frowned at him o course i can not he said number one i don know meself number two yeh know too much already so i wouldn tell yeh if i could that stone here fer a good reason it wa almost stolen outta gringotts i sppose yehve worked that out an all beat me how yeh even know abou fluffy oh come on hagrid you might not want to tell u but you do know you know everything that go on round here said hermione in a warm flattering voice hagrid s beard twitched and they could tell he wa smiling we only wondered who had done the guarding really hermione went on we wondered who dumbledore had trusted enough to help him apart from you hagrid s chest swelled at these last word harry and ron beamed at hermione well i don spose it could hurt ter tell yeh that let u see he borrowed fluffy from me then

steal it harry knew ron and hermione were thinking the same a he wa if snape had been in on protecting the stone it must have been easy to find out how the other teacher had guarded it he probably knew everything except it seemed quirrells spell and how to get past fluffy you are the only one who know how to get past fluffy are not you hagrid said harry anxiously and you would not tell anyone would you not even one of the teacher not a soul know except me an dumbledore said hagrid proudly well that is something harry muttered to the others hagrid can we have a window open i am boiling can not harry sorry said hagrid harry noticed him glance at the fire harry looked at it too hagrid what is that but he already knew what it wa in the very heart of the fire underneath the kettle wa a huge black egg ah said hagrid fiddling nervously with his beard that is er where did you get it hagrid said ron crouching over the fire to get a closer look at the egg it must have cost you a fortune page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling won it said hagrid la night i wa down in the village havin a few drink an got into a game o card with a stranger think he wa quite glad ter get rid of it ter be honest but what are you going to do with it when it hatched said hermione well i have bin doin some readin said hagrid pulling a large book from under his pillow got this outta the library dragon breeding for pleasure and profit it a bit outta date o course but it all in here keep the egg in the fire because their mother breathe on them see an when it hatch feed it on a bucket o brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour an see here how ter recognize diffrent egg what i got there is a norwegian ridgeback they are rare them he looked very pleased with himself but hermione did not hagrid you live in a wooden house she said but hagrid wa not listening he wa humming merrily a he stoked the fire so now they had something else to worry about what might happen to hagrid if anyone found out he wa hiding an illegal dragon in his hut wonder what it like to have a peaceful life ron sighed a evening after evening they struggled through all the extra homework they were getting hermione had now started making study schedule for harry and ron too it wa driving them nut page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling then one breakfast time hedwig brought harry another note from hagrid he had written only two word it hatching ron wanted to skip herbology and go straight down to the hut hermione would not hear of it hermione how many time in our life are we going to see a dragon hatching we have got lesson well get into trouble and that is nothing to what hagrid s going to be in when someone find out what he doing shut up harry whispered malfoy wa only a few foot away and he had stopped dead to listen how much had he heard harry did not like the look on malfoys face at all ron and hermione argued all the way to herbology and in the end hermione agreed to run down to hagrids with the other two during morning break when the bell sounded from the castle at the end of their lesson the three of them dropped their trowel at once and hurried through the ground to the edge of the forest hagrid greeted them looking flushed and excited it nearly out he ushered them inside the egg wa lying on the table there were deep crack in it something wa moving inside a funny clicking noise wa coming from it they all drew their chair up to the table and watched with bated breath page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling all at once there wa a scraping noise and the egg split open the baby dragon flopped onto the table it wa not exactly pretty harry thought it looked like a crumpled black umbrella it spiny wing were huge compared to it skinny jet body it had a long snout with wide nostril the stub of horn and bulging orange eye it sneezed a couple of spark flew out of it snout is not he beautiful hagrid murmured he reached out a hand to stroke the dragon head it snapped at his finger showing pointed fang bless him look he know his mommy said hagrid hagrid said hermione how fast do norwegian ridgebacks grow exactly hagrid wa about to answer when the color suddenly drained from his face he leapt to his foot and ran to the window what is the matter someone wa lookin through the gap in the curtain it a kid he runnin back up ter the school harry bolted to the door and looked out even at a distance there wa no mistaking him malfoy had seen the dragon something about the smile lurking on malfoys face during the next week made harry ron and hermione very nervous they spent most of their free time in hagrid s darkened hut trying to reason with him just let him go harry urged set him free page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i can not said hagrid he too little he would die they looked at the dragon it had grown three time in length in just a week smoke kept furling out of it nostril hagrid had not been doing his gamekeeping duty because the dragon wa keeping him so busy there were empty brandy bottle and chicken feather all over the floor i have decided to call him norbert said hagrid looking at the dragon with misty eye he really know me now watch norbert norbert where is mommy he lost his marble ron muttered in harrys ear hagrid said harry loudly give it two week and norberts going to be a long a your house malfoy could go to dumbledore at any moment hagrid bit his lip i i know i can not keep him forever but i can not jus dump him can not harry suddenly turned to ron charlie he said you are losing it too said ron i am ron remember no charlie your brother charlie in romania studying dragon we could send norbert to him charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild brilliant said ron how about it hagrid and in the end hagrid agreed that they could send an owl to charlie to ask him page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the following week dragged by wednesday night found hermione and harry sitting alone in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed the clock on the wall had just chimed midnight when the portrait hole burst open ron appeared out of nowhere a he pulled off harrys invisibility cloak he had been down at hagrids hut helping him feed norbert who wa now eating dead rat by the crate it bit me he said showing them his hand which wa wrapped in a bloody handkerchief i am not going to be able to hold a quill for a week i tell you that dragon the most horrible animal i have ever met but the way hagrid go on about it you would think it wa a fluffy little bunny rabbit when it bit me he told me off for frightening it and when i left he wa singing it a lullaby there wa a tap on the dark window it hedwig said harry hurrying to let her in she will have charlies answer the three of them put their head together to read the note dear ron how are you thanks for the letter id be glad to take the norwegian ridgeback but it will not be easy getting him here i think the best thing will be to send him over with some friend of mine who are coming to visit me next week trouble is they must not be seen carrying an illegal dragon could you get the ridgeback up the tallest tower at midnight on saturday they can meet you there and take him away while it still dark page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling send me an answer a soon a possible love charlie they looked at one another we have got the invisibility cloak said harry it should not be too difficult i think the cloak big enough to cover two of u and norbert it wa a mark of how bad the last week had been that the other two agreed with him anything to get rid of norbert and malfoy there wa a hitch by the next morning ron bitten hand had swollen to twice it usual size he did not know whether it wa safe to go to madam pomfrey would she recognize a dragon bite by the afternoon though he had no choice the cut had turned a nasty shade of green it looked a if norberts fang were poisonous harry and hermione rushed up to the hospital wing at the end of the day to find ron in a terrible state in bed it not just my hand he whispered although that feel like it about to fall off malfoy told madam pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my book so he could come and have a good laugh at me he kept threatening to tell her what really bit me i have told her it wa a dog but i do not think she belief me i should not have hit him at the quidditch match that is why he doing this harry and hermione tried to calm ron down page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling it will all be over at midnight on saturday said hermione but this did not soothe ron at all on the contrary he sat bolt upright and broke into a sweat midnight on saturday he said in a hoarse voice oh no oh no i have just remembered charlies letter wa in that book malfoy took he going to know were getting rid of norbert harry and hermione did not get a chance to answer madam pomfrey came over at that moment and made them leave saying ron needed sleep it too late to change the plan now harry told hermione we have not got time to send charlie another owl and this could be our only chance to get rid of norbert well have to risk it and we have got the invisibility cloak malfoy doe not know about that they found fang the boarhound sitting outside with a bandaged tail when they went to tell hagrid who opened a window to talk to them i will not let you in he puffed norberts at a tricky stage nothin i can not handle when they told him about charlies letter his eye filled with tear although that might have been because norbert had just bitten him on the leg aargh it all right he only got my boot jus playin he only a baby after all the baby banged it tail on the wall making the window rattle harry and hermione walked back to the castle feeling saturday could not come quickly enough page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling they would have felt sorry for hagrid when the time came for him to say goodbye to norbert if they had not been so worried about what they had to do it wa a very dark cloudy night and they were a bit late arriving at hagrid s hut because they would had to wait for peeve to get out of their way in the entrance hall where he would been playing tennis against the wall hagrid had norbert packed and ready in a large crate he got lot o rat an some brandy fer the journey said hagrid in a muffled voice an i have packed his teddy bear in case he get lonely from inside the crate came ripping noise that sounded to harry a though the teddy wa having his head torn off byebye norbert hagrid sobbed a harry and hermione covered the crate with the invisibility cloak and stepped underneath it themselves mommy will never forget you how they managed to get the crate back up to the castle they never knew midnight ticked nearer a they heaved norbert up the marble staircase in the entrance hall and along the dark corridor up another staircase then another even one of harrys shortcut did not make the work much easier nearly there harry panted a they reached the corridor beneath the tallest tower then a sudden movement ahead of them made them almost drop the crate forgetting that they were already invisible they shrank into the shadow staring at the dark outline of two people grappling with each other ten foot away a lamp flared page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling professor mcgonagall in a tartan bathrobe and a hair net had malfoy by the ear detention she shouted and twenty point from slytherin wandering around in the middle of the night how dare you you do not understand professor harry potter coming he got a dragon what utter rubbish how dare you tell such lie come on i shall see professor snape about you malfoy the steep spiral staircase up to the top of the tower seemed the easiest thing in the world after that not until they would stepped out into the cold night air did they throw off the cloak glad to be able to breathe properly again hermione did a sort of jig malfoys got detention i could sing do not harry advised her chuckling about malfoy they waited norbert thrashing about in his crate about ten minute later four broomstick came swooping down out of the darkness charlies friend were a cheery lot they showed harry and hermione the harness they would rigged up so they could suspend norbert between them they all helped buckle norbert safely into it and then harry and hermione shook hand with the others and thanked them very much at last norbert wa going going gone page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling they slipped back down the spiral staircase their heart a light a their hand now that norbert wa off them no more dragon malfoy in detention what could spoil their happiness the answer to that wa waiting at the foot of the stair a they stepped into the corridor filchs face loomed suddenly out of the darkness well well well he whispered we are in trouble they would left the invisibility cloak on top of the tower page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the forbidden forest thing could not have been worse filch took them down to professor mcgonagalls study on the first floor where they sat and waited without saying a word to each other hermione wa trembling excuse alibi and wild coverup story chased each other around harrys brain each more feeble than the last he could not see how they were going to get out of trouble this time they were cornered how could they have been so stupid a to forget the cloak there wa no reason on earth that professor mcgonagall would accept for their being out of bed and creeping around the school in the dead of night let alone being up the tallest astronomy tower which wa outofbounds except for class add norbert and the invisibility cloak and they might a well be packing their bag already had harry thought that thing could not have been worse he wa wrong when professor mcgonagall appeared she wa leading neville page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry neville burst out the moment he saw the other two i wa trying to find you to warn you i heard malfoy saying he wa going to catch you he said you had a drag harry shook his head violently to shut neville up but professor mcgonagall had seen she looked more likely to breathe fire than norbert a she towered over the three of them i would never have believed it of any of you mr filch say you were up in the astronomy tower it one of the clock in the morning explain yourselves it wa the first time hermione had ever failed to answer a teacher question she wa staring at her slipper a still a a statue i think i have got a good idea of what is been going on said professor mcgonagall it doe not take a genius to work it out you fed draco malfoy some cockand bull story about a dragon trying to get him out of bed and into trouble i have already caught him i suppose you think it funny that longbottom here heard the story and believed it too harry caught nevilles eye and tried to tell him without word that this wa not true because neville wa looking stunned and hurt poor blundering neville harry knew what it must have cost him to try and find them in the dark to warn them i am disgusted said professor mcgonagall four student out of bed in one night i have never heard of such a thing before you miss granger i thought you had more sense a for you mr potter i thought gryffindor meant more to you than this all three of you will receive detention yes you too mr longbottom nothing give you the right to walk page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling around school at night especially these day it very dangerous and fifty point will be taken from gryffindor fifty harry gasped they would lose the lead the lead he would won in the last quidditch match fifty point each said professor mcgonagall breathing heavily through her long pointed nose professor please you can not do not tell me what i can and can not do potter now get back to bed all of you i have never been more ashamed of gryffindor student a hundred and fifty point lost that put gryffindor in last place in one night they would ruined any chance gryffindor had had for the house cup harry felt a though the bottom had dropped out of his stomach how could they ever make up for this harry did not sleep all night he could hear neville sobbing into his pillow for what seemed like hour harry could not think of anything to say to comfort him he knew neville like himself wa dreading the dawn what would happen when the rest of gryffindor found out what they would done at first gryffindors passing the giant hourglass that recorded the house point the next day thought there d been a mistake how could they suddenly have a hundred and fifty point fewer than yesterday and then the story started to spread harry potter the famous harry potter their hero of two quidditch match had lost them all those point him and a couple of other stupid first year page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling from being one of the most popular and admired people at the school harry wa suddenly the most hated even ravenclaws and hufflepuffs turned on him because everyone had been longing to see slytherin lose the house cup everywhere harry went people pointed and did not trouble to lower their voice a they insulted him slytherins on the other hand clapped a he walked past them whistling and cheering thanks potter we owe you one only ron stood by him they will all forget this in a few week fred and george have lost load of point in all the time they have been here and people still like them they have never lost a hundred and fifty point in one go though have they said harry miserably well no ron admitted it wa a bit late to repair the damage but harry swore to himself not to meddle in thing that were not his business from now on he would had it with sneaking around and spying he felt so ashamed of himself that he went to wood and offered to resign from the quidditch team resign wood thundered what goodll that do how are we going to get any point back if we can not win at quidditch but even quidditch had lost it fun the rest of the team would not speak to harry during practice and if they had to speak about him they called him the seeker hermione and neville were suffering too they did not have a bad a time a harry because they were not a page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling wellknown but nobody would speak to them either hermione had stopped drawing attention to herself in class keeping her head down and working in silence harry wa almost glad that the exam were not far away all the studying he had to do kept his mind off his misery he ron and hermione kept to themselves working late into the night trying to remember the ingredient in complicated potion learn charm and spell by heart memorize the date of magical discovery and goblin rebellion then about a week before the exam were due to start harrys new resolution not to interfere in anything that did not concern him wa put to an unexpected test walking back from the library on his own one afternoon he heard somebody whimpering from a classroom up ahead a he drew closer he heard quirrells voice no no not again please it sounded a though someone wa threatening him harry moved closer all right all right he heard quirrell sob next second quirrell came hurrying out of the classroom straightening his turban he wa pale and looked a though he wa about to cry he strode out of sight harry did not think quirrell had even noticed him he waited until quirrells footstep had disappeared then peered into the classroom it wa empty but a door stood ajar at the other end harry wa halfway toward it before he remembered what he would promised himself about not meddling all the same he would have gambled twelve sorcerer stone that snape had just left the room and from page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling what harry had just heard snape would be walking with a new spring in his step quirrell seemed to have given in at last harry went back to the library where hermione wa testing ron on astronomy harry told them what he would heard snapes done it then said ron if quirrells told him how to break his antidark force spell there is still fluffy though said hermione maybe snapes found out how to get past him without asking hagrid said ron looking up at the thousand of book surrounding them i bet there is a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant threeheaded dog so what do we do harry the light of adventure wa kindling again in ron eye but hermione answered before harry could go to dumbledore that is what we should have done age ago if we try anything ourselves well be thrown out for sure but we have got no proof said harry quirrells too scared to back u up snapes only got to say he doe not know how the troll got in at halloween and that he wa nowhere near the third floor who do you think they will believe him or u it not exactly a secret we hate him dumbledore ll think we made it up to get him sacked filch would not help u if his life depended on it he too friendly with snape and the more student get thrown out the better hell think and do not forget were not supposed to know about the stone or fluffy that will take a lot of explaining hermione looked convinced but ron did not page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling if we just do a bit of poking around no said harry flatly we have done enough poking around he pulled a map of jupiter toward him and started to learn the name of it moon the following morning note were delivered to harry hermione and neville at the breakfast table they were all the same your detention will take place at eleven of the clock tonight meet mr filch in the entrance hall professor m mcgonagall harry had forgotten they still had detention to do in the furor over the point they would lost he half expected hermione to complain that this wa a whole night of studying lost but she did not say a word like harry she felt they deserved what they would got at eleven of the clock that night they said goodbye to ron in the common room and went down to the entrance hall with neville filch wa already there and so wa malfoy harry had also forgotten that malfoy had gotten a detention too follow me said filch lighting a lamp and leading them outside i bet you will think twice about breaking a school rule again will not you eh he said leering at them oh yes hard work and pain are the best teacher if you ask me it just a pity they let the old punishment die out hang you by your wrist from page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the ceiling for a few day i have got the chain still in my office keep them well oiled in case they are ever needed right off we go and do not think of running off now it will be worse for you if you do they marched off across the dark ground neville kept sniffing harry wondered what their punishment wa going to be it must be something really horrible or filch would not be sounding so delighted the moon wa bright but cloud scudding across it kept throwing them into darkness ahead harry could see the lighted window of hagrids hut then they heard a distant shout is that you filch hurry up i want ter get started harrys heart rose if they were going to be working with hagrid it would not be so bad his relief must have showed in his face because filch said i suppose you think you will be enjoying yourself with that oaf well think again boy it into the forest you are going and i am much mistaken if you will all come out in one piece at this neville let out a little moan and malfoy stopped dead in his track the forest he repeated and he did not sound quite a cool a usual we can not go in there at night there is all sort of thing in there werewolf i heard neville clutched the sleeve of harrys robe and made a choking noise that is your problem is not it said filch his voice cracking with glee should have thought of them werewolf before you got in trouble should not you page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hagrid came striding toward them out of the dark fang at his heel he wa carrying his large crossbow and a quiver of arrow hung over his shoulder abou time he said i bin waitin fer half an hour already all right harry hermione i should not be too friendly to them hagrid said filch coldly they are here to be punished after all that is why yer late is it said hagrid frowning at filch bin lecturin them eh snot your place ter do that yehve done yer bit ill take over from here ill be back at dawn said filch for what is left of them he added nastily and he turned and started back toward the castle his lamp bobbing away in the darkness malfoy now turned to hagrid i am not going in that forest he said and harry wa pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice yeh are if yeh want ter stay at hogwarts said hagrid fiercely yehve done wrong an now yehve got ter pay fer it but this is servant stuff it not for student to do i thought wed be copying line or something if my father knew i wa doing this he would tell yer that is how it is at hogwarts hagrid growled copyin line what good that ter anyone yehll do summat useful or yehll get out if yeh think yer fatherd rather you were expelled then get back off ter the castle an pack go on page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling malfoy did not move he looked at hagrid furiously but then dropped his gaze right then said hagrid now listen carefully because it dangerous what were going to do tonight an i don want no one takin risk follow me over here a moment he led them to the very edge of the forest holding his lamp up high he pointed down a narrow winding earth track that disappeared into the thick black tree a light breeze lifted their hair a they looked into the forest look there said hagrid see that stuff shinin on the ground silvery stuff that is unicorn blood there is a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat this is the second time in a week i found one dead last wednesday were going to try an find the poor thing we might have ter put it out of it misery and what if whatever hurt the unicorn find u first said malfoy unable to keep the fear out of his voice there is nothin that life in the forest that will hurt yeh if yer with me or fang said hagrid an keep ter the path right now were going to split inter two party an follow the trail in diffrent direction there is blood all over the place it must have bin staggerin around since last night at least i want fang said malfoy quickly looking at fang long teeth all right but i warn yeh he a coward said hagrid so me harry an hermionell go one way an draco neville an fangll go the other now if any of u find the unicorn well send up green spark right page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling get yer wand out an practice now that is it an if anyone get in trouble send up red spark an well all come an find yeh so be careful let u go the forest wa black and silent a little way into it they reached a fork in the earth path and harry hermione and hagrid took the left path while malfoy neville and fang took the right they walked in silence their eye on the ground every now and then a ray of moonlight through the branch above lit a spot of silverblue blood on the fallen leaf harry saw that hagrid looked very worried could a werewolf be killing the unicorn harry asked not fast enough said hagrid it not easy ter catch a unicorn they are powerful magic creature i never knew one ter be hurt before they walked past a mossy tree stump harry could hear running water there must be a stream somewhere close by there were still spot of unicorn blood here and there along the winding path you all right hermione hagrid whispered don worry it can not have gone far if it this badly hurt an then well be able ter get behind that tree hagrid seized harry and hermione and hoisted them off the path behind a towering oak he pulled out an arrow and fitted it into his crossbow raising it ready to fire the three of them listened something wa slithering over dead leaf nearby it sounded like a cloak trailing along the ground hagrid wa squinting page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling up the dark path but after a few second the sound faded away i knew it he murmured there is summat in here that shouldn be a werewolf harry suggested that wasn no werewolf an it wasn no unicorn neither said hagrid grimly right follow me but careful now they walked more slowly ear straining for the faintest sound suddenly in a clearing ahead something definitely moved who is there hagrid called show yerself i am armed and into the clearing came wa it a man or a horse to the waist a man with red hair and beard but below that wa a horse gleaming chestnut body with a long reddish tail harry and hermiones jaw dropped oh it you ronan said hagrid in relief how are yeh he walked forward and shook the centaur hand good evening to you hagrid said ronan he had a deep sorrowful voice were you going to shoot me can not be too careful ronan said hagrid patting his crossbow there is summat bad loose in this forest this is harry potter an hermione granger by the way student up at the school an this is ronan you two he a centaur page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling wed noticed said hermione faintly good evening said ronan student are you and do you learn much up at the school erm a bit said hermione timidly a bit well that is something ronan sighed he flung back his head and stared at the sky mar is bright tonight yeah said hagrid glancing up too listen i am glad we have run inter yeh ronan because there is a unicorn bin hurt you seen anythin ronan did not answer immediately he stared unblinkingly upward then sighed again always the innocent are the first victim he said so it ha been for age past so it is now yeah said hagrid but have yeh seen anythin ronan anythin unusual mar is bright tonight ronan repeated while hagrid watched him impatiently unusually bright yeah but i wa meanin anythin unusual a bit nearer home said hagrid so yeh have not noticed anythin strange yet again ronan took a while to answer at last he said the forest hide many secret a movement in the tree behind ronan made hagrid raise his bow again but it wa only a second centaur page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling blackhaired and bodied and wilderlooking than ronan hullo bane said hagrid all right good evening hagrid i hope you are well well enough look i have jus bin askin ronan you seen anythin odd in here lately there is a unicorn bin injured would yeh know anythin about it bane walked over to stand next to ronan he looked skyward mar is bright tonight he said simply we have heard said hagrid grumpily well if either of you do see anythin let me know will not yeh well be off then harry and hermione followed him out of the clearing staring over their shoulder at ronan and bane until the tree blocked their view never said hagrid irritably try an get a straight answer out of a centaur ruddy stargazer not interested in anythin closern the moon are there many of them in here asked hermione oh a fair few keep themselves to themselves mostly but they are good enough about turnin up if ever i want a word they are deep mind centaur they know thing jus don let on much dyou think that wa a centaur we heard earlier said harry page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling did that sound like hoof to you nah if yeh ask me that wa what is bin killin the unicorn never heard anythin like it before they walked on through the dense dark tree harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder he had the nasty feeling they were being watched he wa very glad they had hagrid and his crossbow with them they had just passed a bend in the path when hermione grabbed hagrid s arm hagrid look red spark the others are in trouble you two wait here hagrid shouted stay on the path ill come back for yeh they heard him crashing away through the undergrowth and stood looking at each other very scared until they could not hear anything but the rustling of leaf around them you do not think they have been hurt do you whispered hermione i do not care if malfoy ha but if something is got neville it our fault he here in the first place the minute dragged by their ear seemed sharper than usual harrys seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind every cracking twig what wa going on where were the others at last a great crunching noise announced hagrids return malfoy neville and fang were with him hagrid wa fuming malfoy it seemed had sneaked up behind neville and grabbed him a a joke neville had panicked and sent up the spark page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling well be lucky ter catch anythin now with the racket you two were makin right were changin group neville you stay with me an hermione harry you go with fang an this idiot i am sorry hagrid added in a whisper to harry but hell have a harder time frightenin you an we have got to get this done so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the tree were so thick harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker there were splash on the root of a tree a though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branch of an ancient oak look he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy something bright white wa gleaming on the ground they inched closer it wa the unicorn all right and it wa dead harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad it long slender leg were stuck out at odd angle where it had fallen and it mane wa spread pearlywhite on the dark leaf harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered then out of the shadow a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered it head over the wound in the animal side and began to drink it blood page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling aaaaaaaaaaargh malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang the hooded figure raised it head and looked right at harry unicorn blood wa dribbling down it front it got to it foot and came swiftly toward harry he could not move for fear then a pain like he would never felt before pierced his head it wa a though his scar were on fire half blinded he staggered backward he heard hoof behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure the pain in harrys head wa so bad he fell to his knee it took a minute or two to pas when he looked up the figure had gone a centaur wa standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino body are you all right said the centaur pulling harry to his foot yes thank you what wa that the centaur did not answer he had astonishingly blue eye like pale sapphire he looked carefully at harry his eye lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harrys forehead you are the potter boy he said you had better get back to hagrid the forest is not safe at this time especially for you can you ride it will be quicker this way my name is firenze he added a he lowered himself on to his front leg so that harry could clamber onto his back page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling there wa suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing ronan and bane came bursting through the tree their flank heaving and sweaty firenze bane thundered what are you doing you have a human on your back have you no shame are you a common mule do you realize who this is said firenze this is the potter boy the quicker he leaf this forest the better what have you been telling him growled bane remember firenze we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heaven have we not read what is to come in the movement of the planet ronan pawed the ground nervously i am sure firenze thought he wa acting for the best he said in his gloomy voice bane kicked his back leg in anger for the best what is that to do with u centaur are concerned with what ha been foretold it is not our business to run around like donkey after stray human in our forest firenze suddenly reared on to his hind leg in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulder to stay on do you not see that unicorn firenze bellowed at bane do you not understand why it wa killed or have the planet not let you in on that secret i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with human alongside me if i must page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on a best he could they plunged off into the tree leaving ronan and bane behind them harry did not have a clue what wa going on why is bane so angry he asked what wa that thing you saved me from anyway firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branch but did not answer harrys question they made their way through the tree in silence for so long that harry thought firenze did not want to talk to him anymore they were passing through a particularly dense patch of tree however when firenze suddenly stopped harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for no said harry startled by the odd question we have only used the horn and tail hair in potion that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn said firenze only one who ha nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touch your lip harry stared at the back of firenze head which wa dappled silver in the moonlight but who would be that desperate he wondered aloud if you are going to be cursed forever death better is not it page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling it is firenze agreed unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die mr potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment the sorcerer stone of course the elixir of life but i do not understand who can you think of nobody who ha waited many year to return to power who ha clung to life awaiting their chance it wa a though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harrys heart over the rustling of the tree he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met some say he died codswallop in my opinion do not know if he had enough human left in him to die do you mean harry croaked that wa voz harry harry are you all right hermione wa running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her i am fine said harry hardly knowing what he wa saying the unicorn dead hagrid it in that clearing back there this is where i leave you firenze murmured a hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn you are safe now harry slid off his back page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling good luck harry potter said firenze the planet have been read wrongly before now even by centaur i hope this is one of those time he turned and cantered back into the depth of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return he shouted something about quidditch foul when harry roughly shook him awake in a matter of second though he wa wide eyed a harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest harry could not sit down he paced up and down in front of the fire he wa still shaking snape want the stone for voldemort and voldemorts waiting in the forest and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich stop saying the name said ron in a terrified whisper a if he thought voldemort could hear them harry wa not listening firenze saved me but he should not have done so bane wa furious he wa talking about interfering with what the planet say is going to happen they must show that voldemorts coming back bane think firenze should have let voldemort kill me i suppose that is written in the star a well will you stop saying the name ron hissed so all i have got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone harry went on feverishly then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off well i suppose bane be happy page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort harry everyone say dumbledores the only one youknowwho wa ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho will not touch you anyway who say the centaur are right it sound like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall say that is a very imprecise branch of magic the sky had turned light before they stopped talking they went to bed exhausted their throat sore but the night surprise were not over when harry pulled back his sheet he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them there wa a note pinned to it just in case page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling through the trapdoor in year to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exam when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment yet the day crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy wa still alive and well behind the locked door it wa sweltering hot especially in the large classroom where they did their written paper they had been given special new quill for the exam which had been bewitched with an anticheating spell they had practical exam a well professor flitwick called them one by one into his class to see if they could make a pineapple tapdance across a desk professor mcgonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox point were given for how pretty the snuffbox wa but taken away if it had whisker snape made them all nervous breathing down their neck while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pain in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerve because harry could not sleep but the truth wa that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it wa now worse than ever because there wa a hooded figure dripping blood in it maybe it wa because they had not seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they did not have scar burning on their forehead but ron and hermione did not seem a worried about the stone a harry the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he did not keep visiting them in dream and they were so busy with their studying they did not have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to their very last exam wa history of magic one hour of answering question about batty old wizard who would invented selfstirring cauldron and they would be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam result came out when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quill and roll up their parchment harry could not help cheering with the rest that wa far easier than i thought it would be said hermione a they joined the crowd flocking out onto the sunny ground i need not have learned about the werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager hermione always liked to go through their exam paper afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree the weasley twin and lee jordan were page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling tickling the tentacle of a giant squid which wa basking in the warm shallow no more studying ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass you could look more cheerful harry we have got a week before we find out how badly we have done there is no need to worry yet harry wa rubbing his forehead i wish i knew what this mean he burst out angrily my scar keep hurting it happened before but never a often a this go to madam pomfrey hermione suggested i am not ill said harry i think it a warning it mean danger coming ron could not get worked up it wa too hot harry relax hermione s right the stone safe a long a dumbledores around anyway we have never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy he nearly had his leg ripped off once he not going to try it again in a hurry and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid let u dumbledore down harry nodded but he could not shake off a lurking feeling that there wa something he would forgotten to do something important when he tried to explain this hermione said that is just the exam i woke up last night and wa halfway through my transfiguration note before i remembered wed done that one harry wa quite sure the unsettled feeling did not have anything to do with work though he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in it mouth hagrid wa the only one page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling who ever sent him letter hagrid would never betray dumbledore hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy never but harry suddenly jumped to his foot where re you going said ron sleepily i have just thought of something said harry he had turned white we have got to go and see hagrid now why panted hermione hurrying to keep up do not you think it a bit odd said harry scrambling up the grassy slope that what hagrid want more than anything else is a dragon and a stranger turn up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket how many people wander around with dragon egg if it against wizard law lucky they found hagrid do not you think why did not i see it before what are you talking about said ron but harry sprinting across the ground toward the forest did not answer hagrid wa sitting in an armchair outside his house his trouser and sleeve were rolled up and he wa shelling pea into a large bowl hullo he said smiling finished yer exam got time fer a drink yes please said ron but harry cut him off no were in a hurry hagrid i have got to ask you something you know that night you won norbert what did the stranger you were playing card with look like page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling do not know said hagrid casually he wouldn take his cloak off he saw the three of them look stunned and raised his eyebrow it not that unusual yeh get a lot o funny folk in the hog head that is one o the pub down in the village mighta bin a dragon dealer mightn he i never saw his face he kept his hood up harry sank down next to the bowl of pea what did you talk to him about hagrid did you mention hogwarts at all mighta come up said hagrid frowning a he tried to remember yeah he asked what i did an i told him i wa gamekeeper here he asked a bit about the sorta creature i look after so i told him an i said what id always really wanted wa a dragon an then i can remember too well because he kept buyin me drink let u see yeah then he said he had the dragon egg an we could play card fer it if i wanted but he had ter be sure i could handle it he didn want it ter go ter any old home so i told him after fluffy a dragon would be easy and did he did he seem interested in fluffy harry asked trying to keep his voice calm well yeah how many threeheaded dog dyeh meet even around hogwarts so i told him fluffys a piece o cake if yeh know how to calm him down jus play him a bit o music an hell go straight off ter sleep hagrid suddenly looked horrified page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i shouldnta told yeh that he blurted out forget i said it hey where are yeh goin harry ron and hermione did not speak to each other at all until they came to a halt in the entrance hall which seemed very cold and gloomy after the ground we have got to go to dumbledore said harry hagrid told that stranger how to get past fluffy and it wa either snape or voldemort under that cloak it must have been easy once he would got hagrid drunk i just hope dumbledore belief u firenze might back u up if bane doe not stop him where is dumbledores office they looked around a if hoping to see a sign pointing them in the right direction they had never been told where dumbledore lived nor did they know anyone who had been sent to see him well just have to harry began but a voice suddenly rang across the hall what are you three doing inside it wa professor mcgonagall carrying a large pile of book we want to see professor dumbledore said hermione rather bravely harry and ron thought see professor dumbledore professor mcgonagall repeated a though this wa a very fishy thing to want to do why harry swallowed now what page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling it sort of secret he said but he wished at once he had not because professor mcgonagalls nostril flared professor dumbledore left ten minute ago she said coldly he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and flew off for london at once he gone said harry frantically now professor dumbledore is a very great wizard potter he ha many demand on his time but this is important something you have to say is more important than the ministry of magic potter look said harry throwing caution to the wind professor it about the sorcerer stone whatever professor mcgonagall had expected it wa not that the book she wa carrying tumbled out of her arm but she did not pick them up how do you know she spluttered professor i think i know that sn that someone is going to try and steal the stone i have got to talk to professor dumbledore she eyed him with a mixture of shock and suspicion professor dumbledore will be back tomorrow she said finally i do not know how you found out about the stone but rest assured no one can possibly steal it it too well protected but professor page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling potter i know what i am talking about she said shortly she bent down and gathered up the fallen book i suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine but they did not it tonight said harry once he wa sure professor mcgonagall wa out of earshot snapes going through the trapdoor tonight he found out everything he need and now he got dumbledore out of the way he sent that note i bet the ministry of magic will get a real shock when dumbledore turn up but what can we hermione gasped harry and ron wheeled round snape wa standing there good afternoon he said smoothly they stared at him you should not be inside on a day like this he said with an odd twisted smile we were harry began without any idea what he wa going to say you want to be more careful said snape hanging around like this people will think you are up to something and gryffindor really can not afford to lose any more point can it harry flushed they turned to go outside but snape called them back page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling be warned potter any more nighttime wandering and i will personally make sure you are expelled good day to you he strode off in the direction of the staffroom out on the stone step harry turned to the others right here is what we have got to do he whispered urgently one of u ha got to keep an eye on snape wait outside the staffroom and follow him if he leaf it hermione you would better do that why me it obvious said ron you can pretend to be waiting for professor flitwick you know he put on a high voice oh professor flitwick i am so worried i think i got question fourteen b wrong oh shut up said hermione but she agreed to go and watch out for snape and wed better stay outside the thirdfloor corridor harry told ron come on but that part of the plan did not work no sooner had they reached the door separating fluffy from the rest of the school than professor mcgonagall turned up again and this time she lost her temper i suppose you think you are harder to get past than a pack of enchantment she stormed enough of this nonsense if i hear you have come anywhere near here again ill take another fifty point from gryffindor yes weasley from my own house harry and ron went back to the common room harry had just said at least hermiones on snapes tail page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling when the portrait of the fat lady swung open and hermione came in i am sorry harry she wailed snape came out and asked me what i wa doing so i said i wa waiting for flitwick and snape went to get him and i have only just got away i do not know where snape went well that is it then is not it harry said the other two stared at him he wa pale and his eye were glittering i am going out of here tonight and i am going to try and get to the stone first you are mad said ron you can not said hermione after what mcgonagall and snape have said you will be expelled so what harry shouted do not you understand if snape get hold of the stone voldemorts coming back have not you heard what it wa like when he wa trying to take over there will not be any hogwarts to get expelled from hell flatten it or turn it into a school for the dark art losing point doe not matter anymore can not you see dyou think hell leave you and your family alone if gryffindor win the house cup if i get caught before i can get to the stone well ill have to go back to the dursleys and wait for voldemort to find me there it only dying a bit later than i would have because i am never going over to the dark side i am going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me voldemort killed my parent remember he glared at them page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you are right harry said hermione in a small voice ill use the invisibility cloak said harry it just lucky i got it back but will it cover all three of u said ron all all three of u oh come off it you do not think wed let you go alone of course not said hermione briskly how do you think you would get to the stone without u id better go and look through my book there might be something useful but if we get caught you two will be expelled too not if i can help it said hermione grimly flitwick told me in secret that i got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam they are not throwing me out after that after dinner the three of them sat nervously apart in the common room nobody bothered them none of the gryffindors had anything to say to harry any more after all this wa the first night he had not been upset by it hermione wa skimming through all her note hoping to come across one of the enchantment they were about to try to break harry and ron did not talk much both of them were thinking about what they were about to do slowly the room emptied a people drifted off to bed better get the cloak ron muttered a lee jordan finally left stretching and yawning harry ran upstairs to their dark dormitory he pulled out the page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling cloak and then his eye fell on the flute hagrid had given him for christmas he pocketed it to use on fluffy he did not feel much like singing he ran back down to the common room wed better put the cloak on here and make sure it cover all three of u if filch spot one of our foot wandering along on it own what are you doing said a voice from the corner of the room neville appeared from behind an armchair clutching trevor the toad who looked a though he would been making another bid for freedom nothing neville nothing said harry hurriedly putting the cloak behind his back neville stared at their guilty face you are going out again he said no no no said hermione no were not why do not you go to bed neville harry looked at the grandfather clock by the door they could not afford to waste any more time snape might even now be playing fluffy to sleep you can not go out said neville you will be caught again gryffindor will be in even more trouble you do not understand said harry this is important but neville wa clearly steeling himself to do something desperate page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling i will not let you do it he said hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole ill ill fight you neville ron exploded get away from that hole and do not be an idiot do not you call me an idiot said neville i do not think you should be breaking any more rule and you were the one who told me to stand up to people yes but not to u said ron in exasperation neville you do not know what you are doing he took a step forward and neville dropped trevor the toad who leapt out of sight go on then try and hit me said neville raising his fist i am ready harry turned to hermione do something he said desperately hermione stepped forward neville she said i am really really sorry about this she raised her wand petrificus totalusl she cried pointing it at neville nevilles arm snapped to his side his leg sprang together his whole body rigid he swayed where he stood and then fell flat on his face stiff a a board hermione ran to turn him over nevilles jaw were jammed together so he could not speak only his eye were moving looking at them in horror page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling what have you done to him harry whispered it the full bodybind said hermione miserably oh neville i am so sorry we had to neville no time to explain said harry you will understand later neville said ron a they stepped over him and pulled on the invisibility cloak but leaving neville lying motionless on the floor did not feel like a very good omen in their nervous state every statue shadow looked like filch every distant breath of wind sounded like peeve swooping down on them at the foot of the first set of stair they spotted mr norris skulking near the top oh let u kick her just this once ron whispered in harrys ear but harry shook his head a they climbed carefully around her mr norris turned her lamplike eye on them but did not do anything they did not meet anyone else until they reached the staircase up to the third floor peeve wa bobbing halfway up loosening the carpet so that people would trip who is there he said suddenly a they climbed toward him he narrowed his wicked black eye know you are there even if i can not see you are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie he rose up in the air and floated there squinting at them should call filch i should if something is acreeping around unseen page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry had a sudden idea peeve he said in a hoarse whisper the bloody baron ha his own reason for being invisible peeve almost fell out of the air in shock he caught himself in time and hovered about a foot off the stair so sorry your bloodiness mr baron sir he said greasily my mistake my mistake i did not see you of course i did not you are invisible forgive old peevsie his little joke sir i have business here peeve croaked harry stay away from this place tonight i will sir i most certainly will said peeve rising up in the air again hope your business go well baron ill not bother you and he scooted off brilliant harry whispered ron a few second later they were there outside the thirdfloor corridor and the door wa already ajar well there you are harry said quietly snapes already got past fluffy seeing the open door somehow seemed to impress upon all three of them what wa facing them underneath the cloak harry turned to the other two if you want to go back i will not blame you he said you can take the cloak i will not need it now do not be stupid said ron page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling were coming said hermione harry pushed the door open a the door creaked low rumbling growl met their ear all three of the dog nose sniffed madly in their direction even though it could not see them what is that at it foot hermione whispered look like a harp said ron snape must have left it there it must wake up the moment you stop playing said harry well here go he put hagrids flute to his lip and blew it wa not really a tune but from the first note the beast eye began to droop harry hardly drew breath slowly the dog growl ceased it tottered on it paw and fell to it knee then it slumped to the ground fast asleep keep playing ron warned harry a they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor they could feel the dog hot smelly breath a they approached the giant head i think well be able to pull the door open said ron peering over the dog back want to go first hermione no i do not all right ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog leg he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open what can you see hermione said anxiously page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling nothing just black there is no way of climbing down well just have to drop harry who wa still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself you want to go first are you sure said ron i do not know how deep this thing go give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep harry handed the flute over in the few second silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into it deep sleep harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor there wa no sign of the bottom he lowered himself through the hole until he wa hanging on by his fingertip then he looked up at ron and said if anything happens to me do not follow go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right right said ron see you in a minute i hope and harry let go cold damp air rushed past him a he fell down down down and flump with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft he sat up and felt around his eye not used to the gloom it felt a though he wa sitting on some sort of plant it okay he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which wa the open trapdoor it a soft landing you can jump page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling ron followed right away he landed sprawled next to harry what is this stuff were his first word do not know some sort of plant thing i suppose it here to break the fall come on hermione the distant music stopped there wa a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped she landed on harrys other side we must be mile under the school she said lucky this plant thing here really said ron lucky shrieked hermione look at you both she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendril around her ankle a for harry and ron their leg had already been bound tightly in long creeper without their noticing hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her now she watched in horror a the two boy fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them stop moving hermione ordered them i know what this is it devil snare oh i am so glad we know what it called that is a great help snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling shut up i am trying to remember how to kill it said hermione well hurry up i can not breathe harry gasped wrestling with it a it curled around his chest devil snare devil snare what did professor sprout say it like the dark and the damp so light a fire harry choked yes of course but there is no wood hermione cried wringing her hand have you gone mad ron bellowed are you a witch or not oh right said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flame she had used on snape at the plant in a matter of second the two boy felt it loosening it grip a it cringed away from the light and warmth wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their body and they were able to pull free lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione said harry a he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face yeah said ron and lucky harry doe not lose his head in a crisis there is no wood honestly this way said harry pointing down a stone passageway which wa the only way forward all they could hear apart from their footstep wa the gentle drip of water trickling down the wall the passageway sloped downward and harry wa reminded of gringotts with an unpleasant jolt of the page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling heart he remembered the dragon said to be guarding vault in the wizard bank if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enough can you hear something ron whispered harry listened a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead do you think it a ghost i do not know sound like wing to me there is light ahead i can see something moving they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber it ceiling arching high above them it wa full of small jewel bright bird fluttering and tumbling all around the room on the opposite side of the chamber wa a heavy wooden door do you think they will attack u if we cross the room said ron probably said harry they do not look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once well there is no other choice ill run he took a deep breath covered his face with his arm and sprinted across the room he expected to feel sharp beak and claw tearing at him any second but nothing happened he reached the door untouched he pulled the handle but it wa locked the other two followed him they tugged and heaved at the door but it would not budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling now what said ron these bird they can not be here just for decoration said hermione they watched the bird soaring overhead glittering glittering they are not bird harry said suddenly they are key winged key look carefully so that must mean he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of key yes look broomstick we have got to catch the key to the door but there are hundred of them ron examined the lock on the door were looking for a big oldfashioned one probably silver like the handle they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of key they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched key darted and dived so quickly it wa almost impossible to catch one not for nothing though wa harry the youngest seeker in a century he had a knack for spotting thing other people did not after a minute weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feather he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing a if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole that one he called to the others that big one there no there with bright blue wing the feather are all crumpled on one side page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling ron went speeding in the direction that harry wa pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom we have got to close in on it harry called not taking his eye off the key with the damaged wing ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and ill try and catch it right now ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand ron and hermione s cheer echoed around the high chamber they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice ready harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle they nodded he pulled the door open the next chamber wa so dark they could not see anything at all but a they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessman which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone facing them way across the chamber were the white piece harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessman had no face now what do we do harry whispered page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling it obvious is not it said ron we have got to play our way across the room behind the white piece they could see another door how said hermione nervously i think said ron were going to have to be chessman he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight horse at once the stone sprang to life the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron do we er have to join you to get across the black knight nodded ron turned to the other two this need thinking about he said i suppose we have got to take the place of three of the black piece harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think finally he said now do not be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess were not offended said harry quickly just tell u what to do well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you go there instead of that castle what about you i am going to be a knight said ron page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the chessman seemed to have been listening because at these word a knight a bishop and a castle turned their back on the white piece and walked off the board leaving three empty square that harry ron and hermione took white always play first in chess said ron peering across the board yes look a white pawn had moved forward two square ron started to direct the black piece they moved silently wherever he sent them harrys knee were trembling what if they lost harry move diagonally four square to the right their first real shock came when their other knight wa taken the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown had to let that happen said ron looking shaken leaf you free to take that bishop hermione go on every time one of their men wa lost the white piece showed no mercy soon there wa a huddle of limp black player slumped along the wall twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger he himself darted around the board taking almost a many white piece a they had lost black one were nearly there he muttered suddenly let me think let me think the white queen turned her blank face toward him page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling yes said ron softly it the only way i have got to be taken no harry and hermione shouted that is chess snapped ron you have got to make some sacrifice i make my move and she will take me that leaf you free to checkmate the king harry but do you want to stop snape or not ron look if you do not hurry up hell already have the stone there wa no alternative ready ron called his face pale but determined here i go now do not hang around once you have won he stepped forward and the white queen pounced she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side he looked a if he would been knocked out shaking harry moved three space to the left the white king took off his crown and threw it at harrys foot they had won the chessman parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling what if he hell be all right said harry trying to convince himself what do you reckons next we have had sprout that wa the devil snare flitwick must have put charm on the key mcgonagall transfigured the chessman to make them alive that leaf quirrells spell and snapes they had reached another door all right harry whispered go on harry pushed it open a disgusting smell filled their nostril making both of them pull their robe up over their nose eye watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on it head i am glad we did not have to fight that one harry whispered a they stepped carefully over one of it massive leg come on i can not breathe he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there wa nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottle standing on it in a line snapes said harry what do we have to do they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway it wa not ordinary fire either it wa purple at the same page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling instant black flame shot up in the doorway leading onward they were trapped look hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottle harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lie before you while safety lie behind two of u will help you whichever you would find one among u seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of u are killer waiting hidden in line choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clue four first however slyly the poison try to hide you will always find some on nettle wine left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third a you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant hold death in their inside fourth the second left and the second on the right are twin once you taste them though different at first sight page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she wa smiling the very last thing he felt like doing brilliant said hermione this is not magic it logic a puzzle a lot of the greatest wizard have not got an ounce of logic they would be stuck in here forever but so will we will not we of course not said hermione everything we need is here on this paper seven bottle three are poison two are wine one will get u safely through the black fire and one will get u back through the purple but how do we know which to drink give me a minute hermione read the paper several time then she walked up and down the line of bottle muttering to herself and pointing at them at last she clapped her hand got it she said the smallest bottle will get u through the black fire toward the stone harry looked at the tiny bottle there is only enough there for one of u he said that is hardly one swallow they looked at each other which one will get you back through the purple flame hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling you drink that said harry no listen get back and get ron grab broom from the flyingkey room they will get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him i might be able to hold snape off for a while but i am no match for him really but harry what if youknow who is with him well i wa lucky once wa not i said harry pointing at his scar i might get lucky again hermiones lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arm around him hermionel harry you are a great wizard you know i am not a good a you said harry very embarrassed a she let go of him me said hermione book and cleverness there are more important thing friendship and bravery and oh harry be carefull you drink first said harry you are sure which is which are not you positive said hermione she took a long drink from the round bottle at the end and shuddered it not poison said harry anxiously no but it like ice quick go before it wear off page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling good luck take care go hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle he turned to face the black flame here i come he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp it wa indeed a though ice wa flooding his body he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flame licking his body but could not feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he wa on the other side in the last chamber there wa already someone there but it wa not snape it wa not even voldemort page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the man with two face it wa quirrell you gasped harry quirrell smiled his face wa not twitching at all me he said calmly i wondered whether id be meeting you here potter but i thought snape severus quirrell laughed and it wa not his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp yes severus doe seem the type doe not he so useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat next to him who would suspect pppoor st stuttering pprofessor quirrell harry could not take it in this could not be true it could not but snape tried to kill me page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling no no no tried to kill you your friend miss granger accidentally knocked me over a she rushed to set fire to snape at that quidditch match she broke my eye contact with you another few second and id have got you off that broom id have managed it before then if snape had not been muttering a countercurse trying to save you snape wa trying to save me of course said quirrell coolly why do you think he wanted to referee your next match he wa trying to make sure i did not do it again funny really he need not have bothered i could not do anything with dumbledore watching all the other teacher thought snape wa trying to stop gryffindor from winning he did make himself unpopular and what a waste of time when after all that i am going to kill you tonight quirrell snapped his finger rope sprang out of thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around harry you are too nosy to live potter scurrying around the school on halloween like that for all i knew you would seen me coming to look at what wa guarding the stone you let the troll in certainly i have a special gift with troll you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there unfortunately while everyone else wa running around looking for it snape who already suspected me went straight to the third floor to head me off and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death that threeheaded dog did not even manage to bite snape s leg off properly page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling now wait quietly potter i need to examine this interesting mirror it wa only then that harry realized what wa standing behind quirrell it wa the mirror of erised this mirror is the key to finding the stone quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame trust dumbledore to come up with something like this but he in london ill be far away by the time he get back all harry could think of doing wa to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror i saw you and snape in the forest he blurted out yes said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back he wa on to me by that time trying to find out how far id got he suspected me all along tried to frighten me a though he could when i had lord voldemort on my side quirrell came back out from behind the mirror and stared hungrily into it i see the stone i am presenting it to my master but where is it harry struggled against the rope binding him but they did not give he had to keep quirrell from giving his whole attention to the mirror but snape always seemed to hate me so much oh he doe said quirrell casually heaven yes he wa at hogwarts with your father did not you page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling know they loathed each other but he never wanted you dead but i heard you a few day ago sobbing i thought snape wa threatening you for the first time a spasm of fear flitted across quirrells face sometimes he said i find it hard to follow my master instruction he is a great wizard and i am weak you mean he wa there in the classroom with you harry gasped he is with me wherever i go said quirrell quietly i met him when i traveled around the world a foolish young man i wa then full of ridiculous idea about good and evil lord voldemort showed me how wrong i wa there is no good and evil there is only power and those too weak to seek it since then i have served him faithfully although i have let him down many time he ha had to be very hard on me quirrell shivered suddenly he doe not forgive mistake easily when i failed to steal the stone from gringotts he wa most displeased he punished me decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me quirrells voice trailed away harry wa remembering his trip to diagon alley how could he have been so stupid he would seen quirrell there that very day shaken hand with him in the leaky cauldron quirrell cursed under his breath i do not understand is the stone inside the mirror should i break it page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harrys mind wa racing what i want more than anything else in the world at the moment he thought is to find the stone before quirrell doe so if i look in the mirror i should see my self finding it which mean ill see where it hidden but how can i look without quirrell realizing what i am up to he tried to edge to the left to get in front of the glass without quirrell noticing but the rope around his ankle were too tight he tripped and fell over quirrell ignored him he wa still talking to himself what doe this mirror do how doe it work help me master and to harrys horror a voice answered and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself use the boy use the boy quirrell rounded on harry yes potter come here he clapped his hand once and the rope binding harry fell off harry got slowly to his foot come here quirrell repeated look in the mirror and tell me what you see harry walked toward him i must lie he thought desperately i must look and lie about what i see that is all quirrell moved close behind him harry breathed in the funny smell that seemed to come from quirrells page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling turban he closed his eye stepped in front of the mirror and opened them again he saw his reflection pale and scaredlooking at first but a moment later the reflection smiled at him it put it hand into it pocket and pulled out a blood red stone it winked and put the stone back in it pocket and a it did so harry felt something heavy drop into his real pocket somehow incredibly he would gotten the stone well said quirrell impatiently what do you see harry screwed up his courage i see myself shaking hand with dumbledore he invented i i have won the house cup for gryffindor quirrell cursed again get out of the way he said a harry moved aside he felt the sorcerer stone against his leg dare he make a break for it but he had not walked five pace before a high voice spoke though quirrell wa not moving his lip he lie he lie potter come back here quirrell shouted tell me the truth what did you just see the high voice spoke again let me speak to him facetoface master you are not strong enough i have strength enough for this page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry felt a if devil snare wa rooting him to the spot he could not move a muscle petrified he watched a quirrell reached up and began to unwrap his turban what wa going on the turban fell away quirrells head looked strangely small without it then he turned slowly on the spot harry would have screamed but he could not make a sound where there should have been a back to quirrells head there wa a face the most terrible face harry had ever seen it wa chalk white with glaring red eye and slit for nostril like a snake harry potter it whispered harry tried to take a step backward but his leg would not move see what i have become the face said mere shadow and vapor i have form only when i can share anothers body but there have always been those willing to let me into their heart and mind unicorn blood ha strengthened me these past week you saw faithful quirrell drinking it for me in the forest and once i have the elixir of life i will be able to create a body of my own now why do not you give me that stone in your pocket so he knew the feeling suddenly surged back into harrys leg he stumbled backward do not be a fool snarled the face better save your own life and join me or you will meet the same end a your parent they died begging me for mercy liar harry shouted suddenly page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling quirrell wa walking backward at him so that voldemort could still see him the evil face wa now smiling how touching it hissed i always value bravery yes boy your parent were brave i killed your father first and he put up a courageous fight but your mother need not have died she wa trying to protect you now give me the stone unless you want her to have died in vain never harry sprang toward the flame door but voldemort screamed seize him and the next second harry felt quirrells hand close on his wrist at once a needlesharp pain seared across harrys scar his head felt a though it wa about to split in two he yelled struggling with all his might and to his surprise quirrell let go of him the pain in his head lessened he looked around wildly to see where quirrell had gone and saw him hunched in pain looking at his finger they were blistering before his eye seize him seize him shrieked voldemort again and quirrell lunged knocking harry clean off his foot landing on top of him both hand around harrys neck harrys scar wa almost blinding him with pain yet he could see quirrell howling in agony master i can not hold him my hand my hand and quirrell though pinning harry to the ground with his knee let go of his neck and stared bewildered at his own palm harry could see they looked burned raw red and shiny page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling then kill him fool and be done screeched voldemort quirrell raised his hand to perform a deadly curse but harry by instinct reached up and grabbed quirrells face aaaargh quirrell rolled off him his face blistering too and then harry knew quirrell could not touch his bare skin not without suffering terrible pain his only chance wa to keep hold of quirrell keep him in enough pain to stop him from doing a curse harry jumped to his foot caught quirrell by the arm and hung on a tight a he could quirrell screamed and tried to throw harry off the pain in harrys head wa building he could not see he could only hear quirrells terrible shriek and voldemorts yell of kill him kill him and other voice maybe in harrys own head cry harry harry he felt quirrells arm wrenched from his grasp knew all wa lost and fell into blackness down down down something gold wa glinting just above him the snitch he tried to catch it but his arm were too heavy he blinked it wa not the snitch at all it wa a pair of glass how strange he blinked again the smiling face of albus dumbledore swam into view above him good afternoon harry said dumbledore page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harry stared at him then he remembered sir the stone it wa quirrell he got the stone sir quick calm yourself dear boy you are a little behind the time said dumbledore quirrell doe not have the stone then who doe sir i harry please relax or madam pomfrey will have me thrown out harry swallowed and looked around him he realized he must be in the hospital wing he wa lying in a bed with white linen sheet and next to him wa a table piled high with what looked like half the candy shop token from your friend and admirer said dumbledore beaming what happened down in the dungeon between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret so naturally the whole school know i believe your friend mister fred and george weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat no doubt they thought it would amuse you madam pomfrey however felt it might not be very hygienic and confiscated it how long have i been in here three day mr ronald weasley and miss granger will be most relieved you have come round they have been extremely worried but sir the stone i see you are not to be distracted very well the stone professor quirrell did not manage to take it page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling from you i arrived in time to prevent that although you were doing very well on your own i must say you got there you got hermiones owl we must have crossed in midair no sooner had i reached london than it became clear to me that the place i should be wa the one i had just left i arrived just in time to pull quirrell off you it wa you i feared i might be too late you nearly were i could not have kept him off the stone much longer not the stone boy you the effort involved nearly killed you for one terrible moment there i wa afraid it had a for the stone it ha been destroyed destroyed said harry blankly but your friend nicolas flamel oh you know about nicolas said dumbledore sounding quite delighted you did do the thing properly did not you well nicolas and i have had a little chat and agreed it all for the best but that mean he and his wife will die will not they they have enough elixir stored to set their affair in order and then yes they will die dumbledore smiled at the look of amazement on harrys face to one a young a you i am sure it seems incredible but to nicolas and perenelle it really is like going to page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling bed after a very very long day after all to the well organized mind death is but the next great adventure you know the stone wa really not such a wonderful thing a much money and life a you could want the two thing most human being would choose above all the trouble is human do have a knack of choosing precisely those thing that are worst for them harry lay there lost for word dumbledore hummed a little and smiled at the ceiling sir said harry i have been thinking sir even if the stone gone vol i mean youknowwho call him voldemort harry always use the proper name for thing fear of a name increase fear of the thing itself yes sir well voldemorts going to try other way of coming back is not he i mean he ha not gone ha he no harry he ha not he is still out there somewhere perhaps looking for another body to share not being truly alive he can not be killed he left quirrell to die he show just a little mercy to his follower a his enemy nevertheless harry while you may only have delayed his return to power it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time and if he is delayed again and again why he may never return to power harry nodded but stopped quickly because it made his head hurt then he said sir there are some other thing id like to know if you can tell me thing i want to know the truth about page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling the truth dumbledore sighed it is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution however i shall answer your question unless i have a very good reason not to in which case i beg you forgive me i shall not of course lie well voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me but why would he want to kill me in the first place dumbledore sighed very deeply this time ala the first thing you ask me i can not tell you not today not now you will know one day put it from your mind for now harry when you are older i know you hate to hear this when you are ready you will know and harry knew it would be no good to argue but why could not quirrell touch me your mother died to save you if there is one thing voldemort can not understand it is love he did not realize that love a powerful a your mother for you leaf it own mark not a scar no visible sign to have been loved so deeply even though the person who loved u is gone will give u some protection forever it is in your very skin quirrell full of hatred greed and ambition sharing his soul with voldemort could not touch you for this reason it wa agony to touch a person marked by something so good dumbledore now became very interested in a bird out on the windowsill which gave harry time to dry his eye on the sheet when he had found his voice again harry said and the invisibility cloak do you know who sent it to me page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling ah your father happened to leave it in my possession and i thought you might like it dumbledores eye twinkled useful thing your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchen to steal food when he wa here and there is something else fire away quirrell said snape professor snape harry yes him quirrell said he hate me because he hated my father is that true well they did rather detest each other not unlike yourself and mr malfoy and then your father did something snape could never forgive what he saved his life what yes said dumbledore dreamily funny the way people mind work is not it professor snape could not bear being in your father debt i do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even then he could go back to hating your father memory in peace harry tried to understand this but it made his head pound so he stopped and sir there is one more thing page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling just the one how did i get the stone out of the mirror ah now i am glad you asked me that it wa one of my more brilliant idea and between you and me that is saying something you see only one who wanted to find the stone find it but not use it would be able to get it otherwise they would just see themselves making gold or drinking elixir of life my brain surprise even me sometimes now enough question i suggest you make a start on these sweet ah bertie botts every flavor bean i wa unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one and since then i am afraid i have rather lost my liking for them but i think ill be safe with a nice toffee do not you he smiled and popped the goldenbrown bean into his mouth then he choked and said ala ear wax madam pomfrey the nurse wa a nice woman but very strict just five minute harry pleaded absolutely not you let professor dumbledore in well of course that wa the headmaster quite different you need rest i am resting look lying down and everything oh go on madam pomfrey oh very well she said but five minute only and she let ron and hermione in page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling harryl hermione looked ready to fling her arm around him again but harry wa glad she held herself in a his head wa still very sore oh harry we were sure you were going to dumbledore wa so worried the whole school talking about it said ron what really happened it wa one of those rare occasion when the true story is even more strange and exciting than the wild rumor harry told them everything quirrell the mirror the stone and voldemort ron and hermione were a very good audience they gasped in all the right place and when harry told them what wa under quirrells turban hermione screamed out loud so the stone gone said ron finally flamels just going to die that is what i said but dumbledore think that what wa it to the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure i always said he wa off his rocker said ron looking quite impressed at how crazy his hero wa so what happened to you two said harry well i got back all right said hermione i brought ron round that took a while and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall he already knew he just said harrys gone after him ha not he and hurtled off to the third floor page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling dyou think he meant you to do it said ron sending you your father cloak and everything well hermione exploded if he did i mean to say that is terrible you could have been killed no it is not said harry thoughtfully he a funny man dumbledore i think he sort of wanted to give me a chance i think he know more or le everything that go on here you know i reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try and instead of stopping u he just taught u enough to help i do not think it wa an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked it almost like he thought i had the right to face voldemort if i could yeah dumbledores off his rocker all right said ron proudly listen you have got to be up for the end ofyear feast tomorrow the point are all in and slytherin won of course you missed the last quidditch match we were steamrollered by ravenclaw without you but the foodll be good at that moment madam pomfrey bustled over you have had nearly fifteen minute now out she said firmly k k k after a good night sleep harry felt nearly back to normal i want to go to the feast he told madam pomfrey a she straightened his many candy box i can can not i page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling professor dumbledore say you are to be allowed to go she said sniffily a though in her opinion professor dumbledore did not realize how risky feast could be and you have another visitor oh good said harry who is it hagrid sidled through the door a he spoke a usual when he wa indoors hagrid looked too big to be allowed he sat down next to harry took one look at him and burst into tear it all my ruddy fault he sobbed his face in his hand i told the evil git how ter get past fluffy i told him it wa the only thing he did not know an i told him yeh could have died all fer a dragon egg ill never drink again i should be chucked out an made ter live a a muggle hagrid said harry shocked to see hagrid shaking with grief and remorse great tear leaking down into his beard hagrid he would have found out somehow this is voldemort were talking about he would have found out even if you had not told him yeh could have died sobbed hagrid an don say the name voldemort harry bellowed and hagrid wa so shocked he stopped cry i have met him and i am calling him by his name please cheer up hagrid we saved the stone it gone he can not use it have a chocolate frog i have got load hagrid wiped his nose on the back of his hand and said that reminds me i have got yeh a present it not a stoat sandwich is it said harry anxiously and at last hagrid gave a weak chuckle page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling nah dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it course he shoulda sacked me instead anyway got y eh this it seemed to be a handsome leathercovered book harry opened it curiously it wa full of wizard photograph smiling and waving at him from every page were his mother and father sent owl off ter all yer parent old school friend askin fer photo knew yeh didn have any dyeh like it harry could not speak but hagrid understood harry made his way down to the endofyear feast alone that night he had been held up by madam pomfreys fussing about insisting on giving him one last checkup so the great hall wa already full it wa decked out in the slytherin color of green and silver to celebrate slytherin s winning the house cup for the seventh year in a row a huge banner showing the slytherin serpent covered the wall behind the high table when harry walked in there wa a sudden hush and then everybody started talking loudly at once he slipped into a seat between ron and hermione at the gryffindor table and tried to ignore the fact that people were standing up to look at him fortunately dumbledore arrived moment later the babble died away another year gone dumbledore said cheerfully and i must trouble you with an old man wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast what a year it ha been hopefully your head are all a little fuller than they were you have the page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year start now a i understand it the house cup here need awarding and the point stand thus in fourth place gryffindor with three hundred and twelve point in third hufflepuff with three hundred and fiftytwo ravenclaw ha four hundred and twentysix and slytherin four hundred and seventy two a storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the slytherin table harry could see draco malfoy banging his goblet on the table it wa a sickening sight yes yes well done slytherin said dumbledore however recent event must be taken into account the room went very still the slytherins smile faded a little ahem said dumbledore i have a few lastminute point to dish out let me see yes first to mr ronald weasley ron went purple in the face he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn for the bestplayed game of chess hogwarts ha seen in many year i award gryffindor house fifty point gryffindor cheer nearly raised the bewitched ceiling the star overhead seemed to quiver percy could be heard telling the other prefect my brother you know my youngest brother got past mcgonagalls giant chess set at last there wa silence again page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling second to miss hermione granger for the use of cool logic in the face of fire i award gryffindor house fifty point hermione buried her face in her arm harry strongly suspected she had burst into tear gryffindors up and down the table were beside themselves they were a hundred point up third to mr harry potter said dumbledore the room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage i award gryffindor house sixty point the din wa deafening those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that gryffindor now had four hundred and seventytwo point exactly the same a slytherin they had tied for the house cup if only dumbledore had given harry just one more point dumbledore raised his hand the room gradually fell silent there are all kind of courage said dumbledore smiling it take a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemy but just a much to stand up to our friend i therefore award ten point to mr neville longbottom someone standing outside the great hall might well have thought some sort of explosion had taken place so loud wa the noise that erupted from the gryffindor table harry ron and hermione stood up to yell and cheer a neville white with shock disappeared under a pile of people hugging him he had never won so much a a point for gryffindor before harry still cheering nudged ron in the rib and pointed at malfoy who could not have looked more page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling stunned and horrified if he would just had the bodybind curse put on him which mean dumbledore called over the storm of applause for even ravenclaw and hufflepuff were celebrating the downfall of slytherin we need a little change of decoration he clapped his hand in an instant the green hanging became scarlet and the silver became gold the huge slytherin serpent vanished and a towering gryffindor lion took it place snape wa shaking professor mcgonagalls hand with a horrible forced smile he caught harrys eye and harry knew at once that snape s feeling toward him had not changed one jot this did not worry harry it seemed a though life would be back to normal next year or a normal a it ever wa at hogwarts it wa the best evening of harrys life better than winning at quidditch or christmas or knocking out mountain troll he would never ever forget tonight harry had almost forgotten that the exam result were still to come but come they did to their great surprise both he and ron passed with good mark hermione of course had the best grade of the first year even neville scraped through his good herbology mark making up for his abysmal potion one they had hoped that goyle who wa almost a stupid a he wa mean might be thrown out but he had passed too it wa a shame but a ron said you could not have everything in life and suddenly their wardrobe were empty their trunk were packed nevilles toad wa found lurking in a corner of the toilet note were handed out to all student warning them not to use magic over the holiday i always hope they will forget to give u page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling these said fred weasley sadly hagrid wa there to take them down to the fleet of boat that sailed across the lake they were boarding the hogwarts express talking and laughing a the countryside became greener and tidier eating bertie botts every flavor bean a they sped past muggle town pulling off their wizard robe and putting on jacket and coat pulling into platform nine and threequarters at king cross station it took quite a while for them all to get off the platform a wizened old guard wa up by the ticket barrier letting them go through the gate in two and three so they did not attract attention by all bursting out of a solid wall at once and alarming the muggles you must come and stay this summer said ron both of you ill send you an owl thanks said harry ill need something to look forward to people jostled them a they moved forward toward the gateway back to the muggle world some of them called bye harry see you potter still famous said ron grinning at him not where i am going i promise you said harry he ron and hermione passed through the gateway together there he is mom there he is look page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling it wa ginny weasley ron younger sister but she wa not pointing at ron harry potter she squealed look mom i can see be quiet ginny and it rude to point mr weasley smiled down at them busy year she said very said harry thanks for the fudge and the sweater mr weasley oh it wa nothing dear ready are you it wa uncle vernon still purplefaced still mustached still looking furious at the nerve of harry carrying an owl in a cage in a station full of ordinary people behind him stood aunt petunia and dudley looking terrified at the very sight of harry you must be harrys family said mr weasley in a manner of speaking said uncle vernon hurry up boy we have not got all day he walked away harry hung back for a last word with ron and hermione see you over the summer then hope you have er a good holiday said hermione looking uncertainly after uncle vernon shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling oh i will said harry and they were surprised at the grin that wa spreading over his face they do not know were not allowed to use magic at home i am going to have a lot of fun with dudley this summer page harry potter and the philosopher stone jk rowling
